It's been quite a long while I've done anything notable. I even come across weed a few times in a year.



An old friend I've met suggested us to smoke some `good weed' and I said `yeah, whatever', due to our long years of time from the past. 



We were very quick with smoking, it tasted quite like the usual but good stuff, whereas there was still a tiny plasticky feeling.



It was so fucked up in 10 minutes. I have never came across to a point of complete disorientation with many many experiences with this, that, those and whatever. This time, I was simply `gone from myself' for some 15 minutes. I felt soo suspicious that this could have been a dream as well. Time dilation was so obvious, each minute feeling like 10 minutes for a while.



I could at least recover back to an identity and prevent any panic attacks within 15 minutes, but it was such a tough job. 



Beware.
