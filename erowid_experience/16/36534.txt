I have had experience with other opiates before, including oxycodone in Percocet and Oxycontin, but I had been clean for a while before doing it this time, what I mean is I had no tolerance at the time.



I took 5 5mg `Endocet' pills (endocet is another brand name for percocet, meaning oxycodone + acetaminophen) on an empty stomach around 11:30pm.  I had considered the `cold water' technique to distill the acetaminophen out but got lazy and the total amount of liver-killing acetaminophen was only about 2500mg, with 4g being the maximum dosage per day.  I also figured since I would be smoking pot, I was pretty sure I would not be sick and keep the pills down.



I started feeling better nearly right away as I smoked a joint and swallowed the pills.  Within 5-10 minutes I felt extremely high, my body felt overcome with warm, velvety pressure.  It was incredibly relaxing yet I felt energetic enough to be social.  At this point I sat with a few other friends and told stories and laughed for about an hour.  Time went very slow and it was sometimes hard to speak sentences properly and would often forget what I was saying mid sentence.



After about 50-60 minutes, I started getting itchy.  I had expected `the itches' but they were not too bad this time.  Mostly my face itched, and I scratched my nose a lot but I have been known to scratch myself until I bleed and I didn't bleed or do anything worse then superficial scratching this time.



This thick, intense high continued for the next hour and I continued to smoke.  I probly smoked 1 1/2 joints to my head in this time.  I didn't have to move around a lot but I didn't have much trouble walking when I crossed the street.  My fine motor skills were very slow though, I kept making mistakes on the joints I was rolling and my hands felt clumsy but I felt great.  During this time my mind was very active and I kept thinking of things I wanted to do but then immediatley forget my ideas.  I found the pills to have a strong effect on my short term memory.



By 1:15 am I was getting very sleepy.  I went to bed and tried to lay down but my mind started to race because I was overwhelmed by the narcotic feeling at this point.  My pulse, though normal, seemed to me to be going at a snail's pace and my lips, nose, hands, and feet were begining to feel numb.  The numbness was not at all uncomfortable but my mind was keenly aware of it.  I tried to sleep for like 15 minutes until some drunk guy came over and threw a temper tantrum.  I was scared by the violence of his emotions and began to think that maybe I might die tonight and maybe I was dead and that's why he was crying so much.  I don't think that this anxiety was too much related to the Percocet though, I am an anxious person in general though I was NOT on any anti-anxiety agents at the time.  I laid down on the couch and tried to keep my eyes open for as long as possible, but within 15 minutes I was completely passed out and I slept until morning, feeling fine but a little hung over.



Even though at the end I got a little overwhelmed with the intensity of the heavy, slow, strong opiate feeling toward the end, Percocet (or oxycodone)is definitly my Drug of Choice.  I would ALWAYS smoke pot while doing it though.  It's intense painkiller properties make me feel amazing.  Maybe I am just a sucker for pills though (I love xanax, valium, klonopin, etc).  I would recommend taking Percocet to someone if they were educated about all the risks -including death- that come along with abusing Rx medicines.  If you have tried oxycodone before I think it is a nice way to get back to the feeling without feeling like your submitting yourself to another addiction becuase I just took them, I didn't have to crush, chew, or snort the pills.



I thought this info would be useful to an avg. sized girl (125lbs, 5'5', medium frame, thin build) to use as a guide of how much acetaminophen they could handle.  Taking 5 5mg Percocets is totally an appropriate dose, I could imagine taking 4 or 6 but not any more or less unless I was going to snort them.
