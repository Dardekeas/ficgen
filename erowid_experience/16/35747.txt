Well all the claims had me wondering\ldots  `Hmmm, a possible good marijuana substitute.'  So yeah i fell for it and bought some (50grams worth!) after reading some decent reviews.



So i recieved it and smoked four bowls, well maybe even five.  Purely the flowers only, and well I must say\ldots  placebo effect came into play here.  I thought i was getting high, but as soon as i decided to challenge it and think `No your not.'  I wasn't.  It was not intense, and it was not anything like MJ.  Sorta like inhaling a bunch of smoke, and kinda light headed.  



Sadly I had the expectations of MJ in my mind, and was waiting for the signs\ldots  although nothing came/happened.  I have been a hard head for some drugs in the past, like Salvia Divinorum, I had smoked 8 bowls and nothing\ldots  but a week later I smoked 2 and I was almost unconcious.  I dont know if this is similar with Wild Dagga, but i sure hope so.



To the people of curiousity\ldots  if you want to try it by all means spend your money, but for those who are looking for a quality MJ experience\ldots  buy the MJ.  Even if times are dry as a desert, I would not smoke this stuff.  I will try it a few more times because I have so much\ldots  if nothing comes then its going on Ebay!  ;)
