I've tripped DiPT more times than I could count on both hands, and thusly will summate the experience as best I can.



45 minutes or so after dosing, the buzzy tryptamine alerts kick in along with a not too terrible nausea that lasts roughly 15 - 30 minutes.

From there the audio effects (deepening and detuning of damned near every sound save for certain high end frequencies, and percussive sounds) will slowly begin to reveal themselves to me as well as a most pleasant body high. Attention spans tend to shot all to high hell on good doses of this substance, and a slight impairment of motor skills becomes noticeable (quite like feeling a bit too loose with one's motions). The comedown tends to be quite gentle, and oftentimes I'll find that the body high and motor skill impairment have all gone away, yet the audio effects remain (which I find to be nicely surreal)



As you can see from above, I've little to say about the effects of DiPT that hasn't already been said save for that the best possible way to describe to others the audio effects of DiPT is oddly enough with the music of V/Vm. 



If you've never done DiPT before, and are curious, then I suggest that you check the URL below, and listen to the track `Lady In Red (Is dancing with meat)'. Hopefully you know what the original Lady In Red sounds like, so as to fully grasp the joys of DiPTs audio fuckery

It's interesting to note that none of the members of V/Vm have ever done DiPT, nor even heard of it when I brought this factoid up to them.
