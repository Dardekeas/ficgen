After having a seizure, I was prescribed this very popular seizure/epilepsy suppressant. Although it was probably not completely necessary since an EEG showed that I was not an epileptic, I was instructed to continue to use the drug for about 6 months. 



I'm a college student and noticed an immediate effect the drug had while I studied.  I noticed a much greater ability to concentrate on even the most mundane subjects as I found myself being able to study and do homework for 6+ hour stretches at a time without a break or day dreaming. I did great that semester, and I can't deny that Dilantin didn't play a role in that.



But there's plenty of side effects to this drug that made me glad to be off of it. These included:



Sensitive gums; An abnormal amount of bleeding from the gums while brushing my teeth



Increased sensitivity to sunlight; I live in the US midwest and had to wear sunscreen during December.



Doesn't mix well with alcohol; This was probably the worst side effect for me.  If I wanted to drink, I had to stop taking the drug several days in advance if I wanted to avoid the nausea.



At least these are the side effects that I experienced that my doctor said were very likely linked to the drug. I also feel I should add that another side effect that \_I\_ feel is connected to taking the drug is having experienced an overall `blah' feeling.  It's kind of hard to describe, but life in general just seemed to be duller while I was on Dilantin. Additionally, I write and perform music and it seemed that my creativity took a noticeable hit during this time. I can't, however, necessarily say for sure that this is all connected to the drug.. there were a lot of other things going on around that time as well.



In short, if you're a college student and want to take this.. I'd recommend just taking it during finals week.  In my opinion, this drugs' side effects are too inconvenient to use as a `smart drug' on anything more than a very temporary basis.
