Here's how I started with a very pleasurable and unexpected experience. I had been reading reports of smoking coffee, seeing as most hard drugs are hard for me to obtain  as I live with my parents. Anyway I had read accounts of people smoking coffee and it's stimulating effects. I figured it wouldn't really work, or if it did it would be so weak I didn't notice. I was wrong. 



Anyway I went into my kitchen one afternoon while my parents were away, and took some coffee out. I got some standard computer paper and rolled it into a joint, putting in maybe 2-3 grams. I continued out into my backyard and lit it up. I smoked the whole thing in a bout ten mintues (it was very harsh smoke, lots of coughing) and went back inside. Even as I was walking inside I could feel some effects. It started very light with my vision becoming sharper and brighter. I went inside and started watching tv, and when I stood up about 5 minutes later I could really feel it. I would say closest to a small dose of opiates, with the same euphoric feeling, except the drowsyness was replaced with energy. 



It's been about an hour since I smoked the joint, and I can still feel the effects somewhat, though the major effects wore off about 30 minutes after I smoked. Didn't cause any problems, no hangover or headache, just happyness and energy.
