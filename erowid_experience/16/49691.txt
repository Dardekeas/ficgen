I had been very determined to find a combination of herbal supplements to help initiate a lucid dream.  I had lucid dreams in the past, but had been finding it difficult to have one lately.  After researching online for the past month I decided to buy a bottle of 3mg Melatonin, 125mg Valerian Root (containing Passion Flower), and a bottle of 100mg B-6.



My fiancée and I tried all sorts of dosages and combinations with little results.  I had read that it's not good to take B-6 regularly because it can jack up my nerves and send me to the hospital, so tonight after smoking a bowl we came inside and took our supplements.  My fiancée's dosage did nothing for her so I'll just describe my own\ldots 



At 2:30am I took 6 pills of the Valerian/Passion Flower supplement (750mg Valerian root and 180mg Passion Flower total) and 1 pill of the Melatonin (3mg total).  Before this, the most I ever took was 5 pills of Valerian (625mg) and nothing really happened except difficulty waking up.  



I was still high but had come down quite a bit so I was expecting the normal drowsiness from the supplements and cannabis combination about 30 minutes from baseline.  I'll document this the best I can:



T+0:00 Smoked 1 bowl of Cannabis.  Felt slightly detached from reality like normal.  My sense of touch is always drastically changed for quite some time after smoking.  Went inside.



T+0:10 Ate a Nutri-Grain bar and half a box of croutons.  Damn munchies!  Then got in the shower.



T+0:40 Took the supplements (Valerian, Passion Flower and Melatonin) in doses listed above, all at once.  Felt pretty tired at this point.  Laid down in bed.



T+1:10 Felt a little out of it.  Figured I was probably just tired.  Became talkative, much to the dismay of my very tired fiancee.



T+1:25 What the fuck?  I'm getting slight pains in my side (which I feel suddenly while writing this, weird).  Because of the paranoia I get from cannabis I worry that I took too many supplements and would have to go to the hospital.  This fear faded though.  



T+1:30 What in the hell is going on in my stomach?  It feels like my stomach is `boiling'.  Never felt like that before.  Felt no nausea though.  Began to feel as if I was floating above my bed.  No, it felt more like my stomach was physically lifting the rest of my body off the bed.  Felt like I was on a strong painkiller like Vicodin (I took once when I had a tooth infection).  I couldn't believe the difference that 125mg more Valerian was causing!  I doubted the cannabis had ANYTHING to do with this great feeling because I knew it had worn off by now.



T+1:50  I imagine this is when I fell asleep.  It felt so good to be floating that I drifted off peacefully and quietly.  It was VERY nice.  I had very vivid dreams that were weird, but not bad.  Lately I had been prone to nightmares but tonight there were none.



T+7:40 Woke up and figured it must have been around 12:00pm because I felt so well rested.  I was surprised to find it was only 10:30am.  Didn't even need any coffee this morning!  I felt great!



I think I'll try this again to induce lucid dreaming.  Have fun!
