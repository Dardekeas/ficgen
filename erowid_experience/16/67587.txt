I've dabbled with a variety of psychedelics and other intoxiacants, and continue to use LSD, mushrooms, ayahuasca and san pedro. I find psychedelics to be far the most rewarding and interesting of all the drugs going.



I've also tried quite a few research chemicals, such as 2CB, 2CI and 2CE, the latter which I have explored a lot more, back in those glorious past days where powerful psychedelics could be ordered cheaply and in pure form from certain internet chemical supply houses, all of which have now vanished, due to government intervention. These drugs have a massive dose response curve, where the addition of just a few more milligrams of material can have a huge impact on the resulting trip. 



I had the opportunity of trying 2CT7, from a trusted source who stated that it was of very good quality, and that it was a `lovey-dovey' kind of experience, much like MDMA. I don't take MDMA anymore, I've had my fun with it, but those times are in the past, so I was up for trying a psychedelic alternative.



There were three of us, myself and my friends Ben and Ollie, and we split 4 doses among there 3 of us. This was the first mistake. The second was to take this in a very crowded house party environment. The third and final mistake was not having a safe refuge -- a darkened room with music and herbal cigarettes, to retreat to.



It turned out this experience was a different league to the chilled out affair we were expecting. And when our dealer-a top guy with fluorescent UV dreads, says a dose is such, you definitely start with that and go from there-I have a feeling he has built up some residual resistance with his possibly frequent psychedelic dabbling.



So we dosed together. I started feeling a gentle buzz in my head, quite nice and chilled. A bit later I noticed details standing out I wouldn't normally notice. This was followed by gentle kaleidoscopic visuals. My friend Ollie seemed to be slightly ahead tripping wise.



I made the mistake of eating cake at some point, which gave much nausea and discomfort on the come up. I was chilling with my girlfriend at the time, and wasn't really feeling in a massive-party-frame-of-mind, and was feeling this before I even dosed. I noticed the visuals were increasing exponentially, colours were luminous and shadows on the ceiling seemed to take on weird meanings.



A bit later my friends met up with me, quite shocked at the level of shpongled-ness, and suggested we go for a walk very soon. To me this seemed like an excellent idea. Outside in the hall, the sensory overload was almost unbearable, Music and conversations were all hitting my brain at one, the carpet and walls were crawling with visuals. It was time to flee into the night. Not having a safe room to retreat to (it was choc-a-bloc with party people at the time, we decided to flee first to Ollies house. There were a few people there getting ready to go out, but I had little desire for social interaction at this point, and the house environment with bright lights seemed highly sterile and unappealing. 



So then we wrapped up warm and fled into nature, and find this field we often go to when tripping). If in doubt, head into nature under the cover of darkness. We layed down in the field and took in the cosmos-directly above us there was a hole in the clouds which was widening all the time so we could make out more stars. The visuals were impressive, mescaline like but more synthetic, with that electric neon character of LSD. But LSD, in my opinion, is much more of an all round fun, enjoyable drug. 



The 2CT7 trip felt very imposed, harsh and abrasive. It definitely felt like this was a tool, and that we had taken more of it than required. All the while was this very electric and quite uncomfortable feeling in my head, and this was definitely not a drug I plan on exploring more, except perhaps for a standard dose. If I want to trip deeply I find the natural psychedelics and LSD a much more comfortable ride.



After a while we went back to Ollie's house for a cup of tea, and met up with our dealer, who sold us a bit of weed, and he was entertaining to have around, and I felt completely at ease with him being there. Me and Ben noticed visual distortions in the tiles the were so vivid it looked like all the tiles had these abstract patterns on them, when they were in fact plain. At this point we had definitely reached the plateau, but it was coming down anytime soon-this would be a long, prolonged return to baseline like acid, just less fun.



A bit later and a herbal cigarette or two later, our friend who's party it was came looking for us. We decided to return to the party, although still heavily twisted. It was 3 in the morning, and the party had thinned out a fair bit, although it was still far too intense an environment to be around. A lot of people were doing ketamine at this stage of the game, and I found the K fiends to be a general drag and a bore to be around. It just had a grotty vibe to it. While I have dabbled with a bit of K and had a one amazing trip on it, the rest of the time it was nothing special, and since this day I haven't touched K again and have no desire to.



So we decided to flee once again back to our field, and into a group of trees beyond. Here we managed to get a fire going from scratch with lighters, leaves and a few old plastic bags. This was a very wholesome and fulfilling enterprise for us, and I highly recommend it to people while tripping.



Around sunrise we headed back home where the party people were mostly asleep or chilling. We cooked up a good breakfast and felt much better for it.



While it seems I am having a rant at this particular drug, I believe the dose, set and setting were all factors in why this particular experiment wasn't a resounding success. If there is a next time, I will take a single dose, in a chilled environment, and with this experience I know more to expect.
