For my age, I am very experienced drug user.  It should be said, I am prescribed 8mg Buprenorphine (Suboxone) per day and take the occasional benzodiazepine.  Aside from these, my involvement with a local drug court dictates that I abstain from marijuana, so about a year ago, I turned to synthetic cannabinoids.



My friend ordered pure JWH-018 from an internet vendor about a year ago.  He and I smoked at least three times a day for almost eight months.  I had a few intense, unpleasurable experiences, including mild panic attacks.  These included thoughts of impending doom, severe paranoia, and other mentally unpleasant side effects.  Bad as they were, nothing I experienced at that point made me seriously consider stopping the synthnoids.  



About a week ago, `A' told me he got `search' (that's what we call research chemicals) and that it was much stronger than JWH-018.  Excited, I purchased a gram from him yesterday morning.  Last night, I put about 10mg on the end of a cigarette and smoked it.  The effects were quite similar to JWH-018, and I had a nice time watching `Superjail!' on TV.



This story is NOT over.



I woke up at about 4AM this morning, feeling fine.  I took a piss, and decided to smoke again before I went back to sleep.  The following is an account of the worst experience of my life.



0:00-  I dipped the cigarette into my baggie, filling the open end with about 18-20mg of pure AM-2201.  Leaning out the window, I pull hard on the cig, knowing how quickly synthnoids combust and disappear.  I held in the smoke for about 15 seconds.



0:20-  I wake up, rolling around the family room of my house.  My shoulder is fully dislocated, and I am utterly TERRIFIED.  I guess `wake up' is the wrong term.  I was definitely having some form of seizure.  The Doors lyric comes to mind: `lost in a wilderness of pain.'  I was completely convinced that I was a SKELETON, and my bones were all dislocated and I was paralyzed.  I distinctly remember looking to my right and seeing my pelvic bone, covered in blood, lying a few feet from my head.  



0:21-  I am obviously still in psychosis, but my dad shows up downstairs in his underwear (NOT a hallucination) and somehow I recognize him, but seeing him does not free me from the insanity.  He tries to hold me down, and I see my arm bones in his hands (keep in mind that I actually did dislocate my shoulder while rolling around on the floor, so the intense pain probably contributed to the nature of my hallucinations.)  This sight makes me panic worse.  



0:30-  I am pleading with my parents to put my body back together.  (At this point, my parents told me that my eyes were rolling back in my head, and I was thrashing about violently while screaming at them to help me.)  My dad is holding my bones together so that I don't fall apart.  I cannot explain adequately the feeling of terror; somehow, my body had been reduced to just bones that were not connected by anything.  I remember shutting my eyes as tightly as possible and focusing on my heart to make sure it was still there.  I started paying attention to my heart, and began to think it was going to stop beating.  I told my parents that I loved them and that I'm sorry I killed myself like this.



0:45-  By the time the paramedics arrived, every muscle in my body was rigid as a board and I thought I was paralyzed.  I was still convinced that I would die when I noticed the lady putting a pin in my arm, which I could not feel.   



2:00-  I woke up in the hospital, still terrified, but gaining composure.



This experience was so far out of bounds and inconsistent with even LSD and PCP that I have no idea what actually happened.  I am convinced that the AM 2201 led directly to some kind of seizure fit.  My parents are SCARRED.  My mother said, verbatim : `Michael, that was the worst thing that I can ever imagine having happen to my child.  That was almost as bad as if you had been decapitated in front of me.'  `The Exorcism' cannot touch what I went through last night.  I would much rather be possessed by Satin than have another seizure fit from AM 2201. NON EXPERIENCED SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID USERS BEWARE:  EXTREME DANGER lurks behind this drug.  I cannot imagine a more psychologically damaging experience resulting from drug use.
