I've been in the dope game for too many years. I remember when crystal (glass) was only used by a select few. Today I see all these young teenagers yearning for the spoon. It drives me insane. I have pretty much ruined my life from my addiction, and well I dont see myself ending my self inflicted tourcher in the near future, I have litterly given my life for my drug.



I started using coke (my first drug) when I was 14 years old. I snorted what I thought at the time was a nice fat rail. It made my intire face go numb, and the energy I got was unreal. I enjoyed the over powering self love, I could do anything, be anything euphoric feeling that brought, I was hooked. 



I didnt move on to everyday use of a substance untill I was in my late teens and early 20's. I was introduced to the `shit' (crank) by a boyfriend I had my first year of college. It reminded me of the first time I got high. I again could do everything, be anything, I again had something to make me feel important. I not only was hooked but I went out of control in a matter of weeks. Unlike coke, meth is cheap, last longer, and the feeling stays with me the intire night. From that moment on my life went to a different path, one that I am not too proud of. 



To maintain my ability to afford the life giving substance, I began to peddle it. Unfortunitily I loved my product too much. I began stealing from my family to pay the man, I even lied and told my family I lost my finacial aid to school one semester so they wrote me a check for \$3500, all of which went up my nose. I hated myself at that point, and the shit made me feel so much better, making me forget, or temporaily put behind me. At this point in time I was lucky-I didnt go to jail, and didnt get robbed, but in sober moments I was looking over my sholder. 



Years progress like a movie, in fast motion. Few minor deterances from my `fun' life landed me in the local emergancy room, and from a overdose to the dentist to have my broken teeth fixed. My face resembled someone who had leporsy, from the burns your mucus membrains get from when your sinuses get inflamed from the stuff that sits in there, that didnt drain. I moved on to IV use. 



Today, my life is horrible. I am almost thirty and due to my bad habbits I have a hard time finding a job, and then keep it. The mood swings of comming down dont help when you lash out at your boss over the stupidest things. I live with my family because of being `known' as a drug user and dealer I am not rentable material. I have the worst credit in the world, cause I spend about a \$800 a week in personal use, I cant sell the stuff cause I cant afford to buy in quantity (enough to sell). I have also got a nice case of hepatitis C. I got the hepatitis from sharing water with someone who used a dirty needle. So I have litterly given my life.
