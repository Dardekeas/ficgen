3:47 am



Just took approximately 25 mg of IAP.



4:12 am



Getting pretty nice head euphoria. Not really speedy, but euphoric. Nose 

feels tingly. Music euphoria. It is a possible SSRI so I do not know how it is going to affect my DXM trips, but I like what I am seeing thus far. Seems to increase the flow of conversation, but I do not notice any actual mood elevation that comes accustomed to GHB.



4:23 am



Nose tingling has gone away, now it is just head euphoria, music euphoria, 

and an opening of senses without any visual distortion. I feel good. It does feel a bit like MDMA.



4:58 am



Euphoria comes in waves, head is tingly and feels good. Like a low dose of 

MDMA - will experiment with 50 mg next time. I feel open and talkative.



5:21 am



Consumed some alcohol. I feel very open and empathetic. Feeling really good. Not intense but very nice positive attitude and energy. Not `let's go out and do something' energy like with GHB but just happy-go-lucky, content with life, talking a bit more than normal, easy to converse, etc. Alcohol definitely adds to the euphoria.



6:29 am



Euphoria, disinhibition (probably from the alcohol added - very synergistic). I could only imagine what GHB and IAP would do together. The euphoria is amazing - it encompasses my entire head. And I feel more open and talkative. If only this could be marketed as an antidepressant instead of Paxil and Prozac, the world would be a MUCH happier place.



6:50 am



Just got stoned with AK-47 strain. I can not tell you HOW synergistic IAP is with weed/alcohol - it feels like a good clean MDMA with waves of euphoria all over my head, without much body buzz or intense effects by itself - increases the flow of conversation, it is truly a remarkable substance. I have found the second best thing to GHB. Perhaps even better, if tolerance is not an issue and I see how it goes at higher doses.



THC provides an amazing synergy with this drug. I now have a full-body buzz 

going. The two go hand in hand. I imagine that GHB+IAP+THC would bring about a full-body orgasm, much like MDMA+N2O.



Sleep was difficult. I was not able to sleep until 12 hours after ingesting 

it. It is a lot longer acting than I thought - the alcohol and marijuana may have prolonged the effects, but I doubt it. Sleep, when it came, was normal.  Today I felt fine, and I notice there is no interaction with DXM. Appetite is normal, everything else fine. Since it lasts so long, I probably wouldn't do this more than once a week.
