I made some absinthe at home using a kit I ordered online. I have some experience with distilling and general chemistry from high school and my early college years, so the setup was easy for me, but there are instructions with the kit.



Anyway, it essentially follows the Pharmako/Poeia recipe. I was pleasently surprised with the results! After using the finishing herbs, the absinthe was a nice light green color, and it smelled pretty good. It louched nicely with water. However, it is very bitter. I've never had commercial absinthe, so I don't know if it is more or less bitter than usual. I don't have a way of measuring the alcohol content, but I can tell it is very high. I probably should have diluted it some. 



After two glasses (each containing 1 shot absinthe + water \& sugar, consumed in about 30 minutes), I was quite drunk. I didn't notice any hallucinations or anything like that. However, I did feel very happy, and very `lovey' toward everyone. I just wanted to hug everyone and tell them how much I love them. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's true. I would attribute that feeling to the absinthe, as I don't usually feel that way when I drink regular alcohol. Other people to whom I've described the effects noted `that sounds like ecstasy to me.' I cannot personally comment on this, as I've never taken e. So take that with a grain of salt. 

In the future, I will experiment with different cocktails, since the absinthe was so bitter. If it just tasted better, it would be a completely pleasant experience! I would, however, caution people to be careful, especially if you make your own, since it is difficult to accurately measure the alcohol content.
