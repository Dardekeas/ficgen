 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



I remember being 13 when I was addicted to aerosol cans, sure it was fun. But when me and my friend R ran out of cans, we wanted more! So we looked around. I went out to the garage and found the gas can. I huffed 3 times before I really felt anything. I heard funny distorted echoes like cars driving by. So I alerted R about it immediately. She just had to try it so I went and did it with her. We thought it was funny as hell we had the same sounds and distortions. 



Around 3 hits the echoes and static distortions pick up. Around 6 hits we felt the oddest feeling of déjà vu. We just laughed at it and kept huffing. Then around 10 hits we saw red dots and heard loud ping noises. From that point on we kept handing the gas-can back and forth to each other well the other blacked out. The blackouts seemed to be filled with red nothingness. All the affects just got stronger. Until she finally said she was hungry so we stood up. 



We walked outside to try and sober up and we both had dizzy after-affects. The after-affects were almost like being drunk (accept it only lasted a minute and I didn't feel the need to fuck around). That was the last time I huffed with my friend R, she moved. So a week later from the last experience I went into my garage and started huffing, the affects were stronger, and the blackouts lasted longer. It was so bad that I sat in there for more than 20 hours blacked out (or possibly sleeping). 



I must have taken at least 70 hits. I woke up fine. I went inside and everybody kept telling me I was missing for a day and I didn't believe them, until they pointed at the calendar. I almost shit my pants. But it didn't bother me that much. The following day after that I went and sat in my garage and huffed more. Around the 10th hit I could have swore I saw heaven. There was a beautiful white light with flowers surrounding it. Then everything went to red nothingness for a moment and I woke up and huffed more. Then I decided to take a break from it for a tad bit until no one was home to notice me wreaking of gasoline. 



3 days later it was 11 AM and no one was coming home until at least 9 PM. So I went and sat out in the garage and huffed again. This time the first 3 hits were devastating. I saw a little yellow distorted face at the left-top of my vision that told me to spit out my brains. So I cocked my head to the left and spit, and the hallucination laughed at my and disappeared. I said out loud `You think that's funny? Watch me huff more!'. 



So I kept huffing, and as usual the affects were standard but thickening. But I had never done it so many times as this. I at least blacked out more than 50 times. Which means I huffed about 5 times that. Then I can barely remember the last blackout seemed to last forever, and ever, and ever. Then I woke up, there was a police car parked in front of my house. I was in deep shit. I had been missing for a week! Which the only thing that adds up is that I must have been in a coma in my garage. I just told everybody I took a road trip with friends. They were pissed. 



A week later I went out in the garage and huffed again, this was a mistake. I huffed once and I saw static and heard echoes. Then an overwhelming sense came over me that told me to stop! So I did and I haven't huffed ever since and nor will I. You see the horrible part is that the affects of that 1 huff never, ever, ever, wore off.
