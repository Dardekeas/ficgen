The reason I am writing this is because back in Febuary 2002 I

decided to experiement with Morning Glory seeds. I accidentally

came upon this website and actually researched the seeds before

trying them. You guys gave me so much good information that I

decided I should give back.



Here's how it all happened for me. On 1 afternoon I went up to

the local K-Mart to look for MG:HB seeds. While in there I found

Martha Stewart brand MG:HB seeds. I proceeded to buy 4 packs

(6grams, roughly 240 seeds). Then I came home and prepared the

seeds. I washed them with dish washer soap, then dryed them on a

paper towel, then ground them up in a coffee grinder.



At 9pm I poured the seeds into a cup of water. Then drank the

potion and ate the remaining chunks of seeds. It was pretty

nasty but definetly wasn't that bad. At about 20 minutes the

effects started to kick in. But these were mild effects. Also

though, my stomach started to hurt and my limbs became very

heavy. So i drank some pepto to help my stomach. At about 1 hour

the effects really started to kick. And once the trip began to

take over all stomach pain just left. At 1st I began to think of

it as just a mild acid trip, which I was happy with. It wasn't

untill about 2 or 3 hours into it that the MG trip REALLY began

to kick hard. Then it felt exactly like an acid trip. Walls were

rolling and breathing. When i walked around the house the floor

began to slant. It felt like the world was tilted. Once I turned

the kitchen light on I was very light senstive. It felt as if

everything was glowing around me. Best way to describe it is,

imagine walking out into the street in the middle of the night,

standing directly under a street light, you can feel the light 

beaming down on you. Honestly, the peak lasted from about 11pm

to 5am. It was very intense and lasted for a very long time. and

i mean peaking, I'm not counting the `afterglow', which as

everyone knows goes on for many hours after the peak is gone.



In conclusion, I highly recommend it, it was fantastic. I've

read many negative reports on here, and I've come to many

conclusions. Maybe they had to low a dosage, got bad seeds, or

weakened the seeds during the extraction process. My advice,

get at least 6grams, clean them, dry them, grind them, drink

them. And don't forget the pepto.
