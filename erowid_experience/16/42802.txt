I had ordered several hundred mg's of the substance from an online supplier and was very anxious to try it.  The day the chemical arrived I immediately took approximately 10-15mg of the substance.  I waited for maybe an hour or so for the drug to take full effect, shortly after I experienced a very heavy body load that tapered off very quickly.  It was a rather disappointing run.  



A few days after I took approximately 30mg of the substance.  I laid down and experienced overall anxiousness, namely what Shulgin refered to as `leg tremors' which were easily controllable by merely laying down and taking my mind off of it.  I put on some headphones and proceeded to listen to pink floyd, which was a good idea to say the least.  



I soon noticed that with eyes closed, I easily drifted off into hyperspace, a truly incredible cosmic sensation that probably would not have been possible if it weren't for pink floyd's space-like qualities.  I immediately fell in love with the sensation of weightlessness achieved with 4ho-dipt with the eyes closed and repeated the experiments several times after (with dosages ranging from 30-50mg).  



I learned from this experience not only how conducive pink floyd is to cosmic experiences, but also about becoming one with myself and the universe. I found them to be a very immersive, inexpensive, and extremely beneficial set of experiences.
