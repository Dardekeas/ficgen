This is a summary of my experiences and impressions of JWH-18. For starters, JWH-18 will completely substitute for cannabis, in every way, for me. At least so far; I have been using it in place of cannabis for the past two weeks and I do not have any cravings for cannabis. Further, I find the `medicinal' properties I look to cannabis for (appetite increase, tension reducer) are completely present in JWH-18. Perhaps the munchies are not as strong, but they are there and I do believe this would stimulate the appetite of an AIDS or Cancer patient.



I obtained a sample labeled 99.9\% pure, but I don't know how pure it really is. When smoked in a glass `oil' pipe (aka meth or DMT pipe), it does not vaporize immediately. Rather, it melts and I have to chase it around the glass bubble with the torch until all of it vaporizes.



So I prefer to make a 100mg/ml acetone solution of JWH-18 which I drop onto damiana flakes. When laced on damiana, it smokes fast and clean. The dropper bottle gives me about 2mg per drop, so I am always able to control how much I smoke. I fill my water pipe bowl with damiana leaf, then drop a chosen dosage on top of the leaves. I wait until the acetone evaporates; I mix up the bowl to make the mixture consistent, and smoke all in one hit. When using the glass bubble pipe, there always seems to be small amounts of condensed vapor that pools to the bottom after I am done vaporizing, so I never really know what I take in and do not use that method anymore.



The nature of the JWH-18 high is unique from `normal, mid grade commercial', but I experience new and unique cannabis highs several times a year when I come across some new, super-potent strain. If I were given JWH-18 laced onto some THC-free cannabis flowers, I am confident that I would have no suspicions that what I was smoking was actually a totally unrelated indole compound instead of THCs! But JWH-18 is still unique from cannabis and the uniqueness becomes more apparent at higher dosages.



I've had some extremely strong out-of-body experiences with JWH-18 that reached an amazingly strong intensity. At extreme dosages (20mg), my vision becomes extremely altered. Colors and sounds are greatly intensified. All objects in view seem to become stretched sideways, as if someone took a square photo and digitally stretched it to the sides. Also at these dosages, there is an overwhelming `alien' feel that I do not experience with cannabis. I can easily see how someone who maybe was not as familiar with extreme drugs such as 5-MeO-DMT, or Salvia Divinorum, could easily find JWH-18 overwhelming and frightening.



However, as long as the dosage is kept under 10mg it is consistently pleasant and easy to navigate. It actually makes me much less paranoid about ``seeming high'' to others than cannabis, though I imagine a lot of this has to do with the fact that JWH-18 leaves no odor like smoking cannabis will. JWH-18 also seems to last a little longer than cannabis. For me, cannabis is a 1-2hr experience while JWH-18 lasts nearly twice as long.



The comedown is similar to cannabis. I feel tired and a little hung over, but it is mild. I look forward to trying more from the series. I have one experience with JWH-73, that I had tried before I used JWH-18, and the JWH-73 did not impress me much, other than the fact that I felt high as if I had smoked pot. It was far less psychedelic and intoxicating as compared to the JWH-18. If I had to sum it up, I would say the JWH-73 is a ``simpler'' high compared to JWH-18. Just as 2C-D is a far more ``simple'' psychedelic compared with, say 2C-E. I will also soon be working with JWH-250 and look forward to comparing the two.



Summary: JWH-18 is a suitable and fulfilling substitute for cannabis.
