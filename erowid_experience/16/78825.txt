The original substance I had was 2c-t-2, which I put into conditions which led to the creation of the substance HOT-2. It was a long process, which I will not detail in this report, as I am a chemist and private researcher. At the end of the process, the resulting product was an off-white powder; now identified as HOT-2.



I then ingested 12mg of the HOT-2, a dose suggested by Shulgin in PIHKAL. I went into this new substance expecting it to be similar to 2c-t-2 with less visuals, and was rather excited to test it out.



Coming up began about 45 minutes after ingestion, it was relatively easy, much less nauseating than 2c-t-2 with some stomach cramps that I have experienced to be far more painful from 2c-t-2. After I got past them, there wasn't much of a body load for the rest of the trip, which was a pleasant change from aches / pains causing a lot of work to keep a 2c-t-2 trip from going in a bad direction.



The peak effects were quite pleasant, notable euphoria that I rarely get from 2c-t-2, though not as euphoric as LSD or 2c-e. OEV's were there, but not easy to focus on. In my peripheral vision, I saw certain areas of my room begin to shift or spin, all of which stopped when I looked in that direction. At times, there were geometric patterns, but they never seemed to last long. Overall, the OEV's were very disorganized, but seemed to be more in the `real world' than 2c-t-2. CEV's were relatively simple as well, flashing colors and moving dots more than patterning. There was a high aspect of confusion, but it was easier to manage than the confusion of 2c-t-2 likely because HOT-2 is not nearly as dissociating as 2c-t-2. There was also more energy to it physically that was not present with 2c-t-2.



Coming down was relatively easy, which I really enjoyed because 2c-t-2 gives me the feeling that I am being squished, and is very painful. The energy lasted a few hours after I had come down, with difficulty sleeping in that time period.



Overall, I found HOT-2 to be more enjoyable than 2c-t-2, with perhaps more therapeutic capabilities than 2c-t-2 due to the lack of a miserable body load. I hope I have the opportunity to test out HOT-2 in the future, or even maybe venture into HOT-7.
