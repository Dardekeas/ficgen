Just thought I'd share a nice experiment. As many do, I occasionally enjoy smoking Marijuana.  However, as I've gotten older I've found that I experience more paranoia or other types of mental discomfort when smoking, which is sometimes OK, but not as the rule.  



At to counter those negative effects, I tried to drink some alcohol before smoking. This usually decreased the paranoia, but often left me too wasted and often I'd have a hell of a hangover the next day (I generally don't like alcohol\ldots it hurts too much).



So I started to look around for a better way to remove the anxiety related effects of Marijuana and leave the pleasant effects. I started to read about Kava Kava and figured since it is often used as an anti-anxiety medicine and is freely available it might work well.



It does the trick. About 3-4 droppers of the standardized Kava does the job nicely.  Available at most any vitamin type place for about \$10 for a bottle, the standardized version apparently adheres to a European law that requires standard strengh. Thus I suggest that one to insure consistency of effect.



The normal dose is one dropper 3 times a day. I even though I use 3-4 droppers at once before smoking, I wouldn't advise using more in a day. I've read that over-use can cause skin irritations.



I take the Kava about 30-45 minutes before smoking in a little juice, then fire up.  It gives you such a nice buzz and you feel really just totally relaxed and pleasant.  One subtle side effect is that you may really want to sleep about 3 hours after this, but you'll wake up refreshed and rested for sure!  This is a great approach for folks like me who are occasional weekend type users and just like to relax with a smoke now and again.



The Kava is handy for general anxiety too\ldots feel stressed\ldots no problem have some Kava alone and it'll help to calm your nerves.



Enjoy!
