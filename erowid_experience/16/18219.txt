i decided to write a little bit about the recreational use of methadone because no one else really seems to be. 



my friend recently got 100 pills from a pharmacy. he hooked me up with a bunch so i took them one night when i was by myself.



i have done all sorts of drugs and have been doing drugs heavily for about five years now. i somehow managed not to really get into opiates\ldots . so i found myself in for a real treat. 



this feeling was like the high i always wanted. it was that of bliss and heaven. i was happy and content with my life while on the drug. i didnt feel lonely at all. i had a greater apriciation for music, which i was listening to all night. it brought out great artistic abilites in me and i drew 2 amazing pictures. this was soooo much fun.



my favorite part was this drug lasts 24 hours. i can totally see how ppl can get hooked on this drug so dont over endulge.
