I see that there are few personal experience reports for the perscription drug Elavil (Amitriptyline).  Well, here's mine.  This happened a few years ago, I suppose I was 16 or 17.  I was in kind of a low period in my life and was using more drugs than would be considered healthy for anyone\ldots   



Anyway, a friend and I were talking about drugs and she said that one of her favorite `Psike' pills was Elavil.  Ok, whatever, I had never even heard of them.  Well, a few weeks later my grandma came to town and viola, there in her purse (I said this was a low point) was a bottle of Tylenol-3  and another bottle of Elavil, I was using heroin on and off at this point so I left the Tylenol-3s alone, I took 3 of the Elavils just to try:)  



The next morning I left for school, I popped 1 of the pills to see if I could feel anything, about 1 hour later\ldots nothing, so I took another one.  10 min later I could not hold my head up or focus my eyes, this was not cool.  My first period teacher liked me, but she knew I was a druggy.  I started to fall asleep, meaning I was visably noding,  She asked me if I was ok, and I said I was fine.  At this point I was more fucked up than I generally like to be, and I was starting to get scared.  I did not feel that that I was in danger of ODing, however, I was in danger of losing consciousness, and did not want to end up in the ER\ldots  So, rather suddenly, I stood up and `staggered' out of the classroom, my teacher was `yelling'  `Ian, get back here, where are you going, whats wrong with you?!?'  I managed so slur out `I feel sick' and with that, I was out of the classroom, I managed `somehow' to avoid school security and get off school grounds.  From there, I stumbled/staggered apx. 1/2 mile to a local park where I promptly fell asleep\ldots 



\ldots about 10 hours later (9:30-10:00pm) I woke up, feeling ok, but not great, I walked home apx. 3 miles.  I had some explaining to do when I got home, but I managed to lie, lie, lie my way out of it.



To that end Elavil is a VERY strong substance, it came on strong and suddenly, it made me feel as though I had drunk a gallon of liquer and smoked a pound of pot without the `sick' feeling, the `scared' feeling I decribed earlier was more the very small fuctioning portion of my brain saying in a very plain and Spok-ish voice that if I did not leave I could get in seroius trouble.  Emotional sensation was dulled almost to the point of non-existance, colors were dulled, and I didn't have any fun.
