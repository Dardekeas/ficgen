Hopefully this report will be useful as the chemicals involved are quite new and rare in the drug scene. First, some background information: I'm a male 17 years of age, and have experience with various stimulants, psychedelics and depressants. This combination of chemicals was used to enhance the experience of a large rave gig; as I was attending with friends with no or little experience of the types of drug involved, 2C-I dosage was kept low and instead of much more desirable MDMA, an off-the-shelf `party-pill' analysed to contain bk-MBDB (butylone) and mCPP was used. You've got to start somewhere ;)



The 2C-I was taken by myself and two others about an hour before the gig started. The pills were dropped about an hour after the 2C-I was taken, by myself and three others.



Little effects were felt as the first band performed, however an increasing anticipation marked the come-up of the combination of chemicals taken. As the headliner took the stage, this anticipation became more than a rush of adrenaline; the arena became more alive and mood was elevated. I began to notice some signature effects of 2C-I; greater contrast between colours, persistence of vision and enhanced perspective - the arena appeared much more spacious. It's harder for me to place the effects of the bk-MBDB - our moods were certainly elevated, but there were no overwhelming rushes of euphoria. Just a contented wellbeing.



Dancing was uninhibited and energetic; this was the responsibility of mCPP, providing a constant and lucid stream of energy. Mid-set, a friend and I went to rehydrate with water, also bringing some for the other friends. When walking through the corridor to the toilets, the excess energy was noticable when it wasn't being used. Back to the gig and we continued dancing until the gig ended. Mood was still elevated throughout the set and we were still buzzing walking out of the venue. We then went to our car (driven by someone completely sober who had not attended the gig) and to a service station where we had a room booked to stay.



By this time, I noticed the bk-MBDB had worn off. Mood was back to normal, however the strong stimulant effect of the mCPP was in full force; side-effects included a constantly high heart rate (and most likely blood pressure) and dilated, dark pupils. Oddly, the presence of this stimulant seemed to diminish the psychadelia of the 2C-I. Even in small doses, 2C-I is able to take me to an interesting headspace. This was barely felt throughout the evening, only the visual effects were observed. It was impossible to sleep for another four hours, and the mCPP produced undesirable dry mouth, a constant thirst and an excess of energy.



After a couple hours of sleep, the effects of all the chemicals had worn off and we were back to baseline. I took some 5-HTP supplements to ensure serotonin levels wouldn't take too much of a hit. 



In conclusion, this was a novel combination of chemicals for a gig experience. I find 2C-I to be a very versatile drug, producing both a true psychadelic headspace and interesting visuals. In this case, the other chemicals seemed to reduce this to just visual enhancement. I would best describe this as a `sparkle' to the evening. bk-MBDB seems to produce a very natural mood elevation, but no rushes of euphoria, and no apparent dopaminergic activity. Despite this being a positive property, one friend thought this effect weak; ironically, he has no prior drug experience bar alcohol (he had not taken the 2C-I). I couldn't assess the stimulant property without the abscence of mCPP. This was the let-down of the combination, mCPP. Whilst it provided useful, lucid energy, the comedown, side-effects and awkward duration heightens my dislike for piperazines and I would not like to use it again.



Ultimately, MDMA and 2C-I would have provided a much more enjoyable experince overall, although too intense for first-time users. However, each of us had a fantastic evening and for my three friends, it proved a good introduction to the use of `dance-drugs'.
