[Erowid Note: While it may be that the substance described below was PMA, the identification is speculative without more data to support it. Readers should be aware that this is more of a general Ecstasy report.] 



I've had several experiences with PMA (apparently PDA is a term also used here in Belguim to describe what I think is the same substance). The most recent experience (I think) was at a small party organized by friends of a friend. Earlier that day I'd visited holland for 5gr high potent weed. (only 45min drive and lately it's worth it if I compare the herb's quality to what I'm getting here(Ghent)) by the evening I'd smoked an estimate of 3 joints. I think it's significant to mention that I smoke weed on a daily basis and have been for several years, resulting in a fairly high tolerance of the drug.



The first dose of PMA was around 1.30h, 5 of us split 1gr of the crystalline PMA, so we each took about 200mg of it orally (in a small balled up rizla). It's important to mention here that we assumed it was MDMA, although knowing the risk of it being PMA existed, but in my opinion just choosing to ignore it at the time, badly seeking the MDMA rush. When we went back in (we took the PMA outside) I sat down  at the side, having been tired most of the day, thinking the MDMA euphoria would later push me enough to get up (I know, even if this had been genuine MDMA that it lacks the characteristic of being a true stimulant,it won't make the feeling of tiredness go away, but when combined with the right music it increases aprreciation to such a level that this is enough to deliver the needed energy). Instead I found myself laying there most of the night. I had the tendency to close my eyes, because in combination with the music (Goa, Psy-trance, dnb) this brought on the distinct euphoria feeling. But this feeling was very unstable, allowing me to slip into an anticlimax just moments after the euphoria, and then back into climax, back to anticlimax and so on..the needed energy didnt come but I must say most of the time laying there I was REALLY enjoying the music. My body temperature also had definite peaks but nothing as extreme as I've heard or read about (although on other occasions it has been more profound). 



Round 6h I think it was, although I must say by this time I'd lost track of time, we left for a friends house. By this time almost all of the effects of the drug had worn off (as far as I could tell at the time). Some people were sitting/lying/tripping inside, some people enjoying the first sun (and a sandbox) outside. Everyone took some drinks (to make it easier, I'll just mention here that throughout everything described below I also drank about 4-5glasses of wine and smoked about 6-7 joints, although all of these where split with about 4 people). 



About an hour after arriving there (again, this is an estimate), we crushed another gram of the PMA into fine powder for sniffing (we didn't want to sniff the big crystals, obviously.) We shared the gram between 3 of us. It's very important to mention that this gram was sniffed in a timespan of about 4-8h by the three of us, so it's not like we divided it in three and each sniffed a third at once (again, obviously..) The effect when sniffed is clearly different to oral ingestion. There are no clear peaks in the effect like I had before, but a constant effect that seemed to keep to the background. Also less teeth clenching than before. Especially later that day, I was very enthusiastic in conversation and social barriers (which are usually very well guarded.) Were mostly down, although this wasnt always very easy. On several occasions I completely forgot what I was saying when I got to about half the sentence. Other than that there were no overwhelming effects. By 4.00(for anyone who hasn't managed to keep up with the timescale, it's now 4o clock in the afternoon of the next day) most people started going home. I finished with a small amount of speed, although I must now admit that I was in no state remember anything about amounts, so I really cant give you much reliable info on that.. As far as I know the speed didnt affect my mental state in any way. 



At 5o clock I arrived home, and from here on in everything is very hazy. I do remember an illness in my stomach later that evening, although this could just as well have been due to the alcohol combined with not eating in more than a day.  Later I fell asleep and slept VERY well, my brother did not succeed in waking me up (and I have to add that his failure was not due to any incompetence on his part) when he tried to do so only a few hours after I fell asleep. 



I'm now doubting what the substance was. I'm pretty sure it wasn't true MDMA, I would've recognized the distinct feeling (although not having done it often, but I'm quite sure many would agree the feeling is distinct).I should also add that I did (mostly after the oral ingestion) experience an increased libido. I did recognize the PMA symptoms, but not as strongly as usual. This either means it wasn't PMA but a less dangerous alternative such as MDA, or it means that sniffing the drug decreases the unwanted effects of the dangerous PMA? 



I repeat that the drug was in crystalline form, and not compressed into pills, so that it would have been easy to detect if it had been a mixture of more substances (or so I suspect).
