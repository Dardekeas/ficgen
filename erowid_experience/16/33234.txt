Having read many reports of Ayahuasca using various combinations of plants, I decided to try a combination of syrian rue and diplopterys only. A combination which I have not heard of before. I had no experience with dmt or harmala before, however I had in the past experimented with 5-meo-dmt and any other psychedelics I could get my hands on.



30 grams of diplopterys was put into a mixture of a liter of water with the juice of 2 lemons and 1000mg of asorbic acid (vitamin C). The mixture was brought to a low boil and stirred regularly for 40 minutes. 



5 grams of syrian rue (almost 2 teaspoons) were ground up and put into capsules.



T+0:00 The syrian rue capsules were taken with water on an empty stomach. Ground up the powder fit into 9 pills, not very pleasant to swallow. Having heard of the negative effects (ie vomiting) of taking ayahuasca with food I had decided to refrain from eating. 



T+0:45 My stomach was feeling most unpleasant, since two of my friends were over making food, I decided to have some french fries with them. I ended up eating most of them.



T+1:30 Having sat down to watch a movie with my friend T, I realized I was starting to feel a strong pulsing sensation through my body. I hadn't expected to feel anything significant untill ingesting the diplopterys cabrerana brew, so I proceeded to the kitchen and drank what I can only aproximate to be somewhere between 25 and 75ml of the brew, which was about 1/10 of the filtered and boiled down solution.



T+1:45 I started to experience strong visuals in the form of trails along with a strong sense of disorientation. I felt a sort of non-locality, as if my inner being was being swung around while my physical body remained monitionless. This sensation would intensify when I'd close my eyes.



T+2:00 No increased visual effects, but the sensation of inner motion had become so strong I was starting to feel motion sickness and had to ask my friend T, who was on dxm to leave as I could no longer act as a host. While he is a good friend, I did not want him in my house while I was tripping this strongly. I bid him farewell and retreated to the bathroom as I knew I was going to be ill.



T+2:10 I had heard of extreme vomiting from taking ayahuasca, and was relieved to find that after minor vomiting my stomach was much relieved. I was glad to have eated the french fries so I did not have to vomit bile. When I flushed the toilet, the usually familiar sound it makes had turned into a mechanical vibrating noise. Running tap water also made a sound which I can only describe as alien to my normal perception. I started to experience visual hallucinations in the form of vivid colors and patterns emerging from ordinary objects. A blue rug became a brilliant emerald and ruby colored matrix of shapes that were both prismic and organic. I felt as if this image was a gateway to another world. I began to enter and was sudenly jolted back and the rug has returned to its normal blue self.



T+2:40 I had returned to my room where I lay with my girlfriend who was surfing the net. She asked me how I was doing and all I could respond was that I was fine. I did not have the vocabulary or the concentration required to explain this vivid, alien and disorienting world I was experiencing. I was not having fun, but I was enjoying the odd dimensions my curiosity was taking me too. I felt as if the thoughts I was having were not entirely mine. I wanted to take dmt and gain inner knowledge and strength, but I was experiencing a world in which those things were insignificant. I recall a conversation I had, with what I do not know, but I know something was telling me my desires were insignificant. I argued that unless there was a greater meaning to life of which I was not privied, that those things made me happy and that was all that mattered in life.



By T+4:00 the strong trip had either mellowed or I had become used to its effects.



At T+7:00 (3am) I was finally able to get to sleep.



The experience was not something I would repeat for at least a week, it was not fun, but it did give me some very interesting perspectives. I remember desperately forcing myself to recall one single insight I had received above all else, and that is that we all must learn to sit back and relax. Contrary to how most people would interpret this, I meant it in the sense that in dealing with life and most importantly people, one should observe from a detached but not disinterested stance. Listening to what people say instead of filtering things that are said through our own impressions and beliefs.



Oh and for those of you who are undoubtably curious, for males, unless you happen to have some viagra, in my experience, sex on dmt will not work.



I have also come to the realisation that syrian rue on its own is a potent psychedelic as I was experiencing strong effects before ever taking the cabrerana. I isolated the syrian rue effects as an intense vibration and a sensation of my body feeling smaller and out of proportion, the same thing I experience with high fevers.
