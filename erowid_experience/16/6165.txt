Im a university graduate with a degree in psychology. I studied drugs and their effects on humans. I've used many drugs, including opium (and the questionable redrock).



While temporarily living in Japan, I was limited to my choice of drugs. I decided to search for legal highs, and chose opium lettuce. I found some, and picked several plants and returned home with them. I made a tea with about 1.5grams (not exact), and felt very odd, but unsure of the effect. I also scraped some of the milky white substance and allowed it to dry. 



Later, when I was sure I was feeling completely normal, I smoked it in a homemade pipe. I had not used any other drugs or medications for several weeks. I really didnt expect anything to happen with such a small dose. I was wrong, however, and soon after taking the few hits available, I felt an unmistakeable opium like high. Mild, but definately there.



Euphoria, well being, comfort with myself, enhanced colours. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It even had a sweet taste, somewhat similar to opium. I will begin collecting more of the substance soon. A good method of collecting the resin would be useful, as it's a bit sticky and hard to work with. It's not as good as real opium or marijuana, but it's free and legal, and the stuff grows everywhere.
