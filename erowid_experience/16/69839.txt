having heard for-ages the legend of `drinking alcohol rectally' and then reading about amy winehouse snorting a shot of vodka and not-dying\ldots  i decided to finally try alcohol rectally yesterday.



from searching online most postings recommended using a standard enema applicator and mixing warm/body-temp water in a 1-to-ratio with any burgundy/red wine (which is 20 to 30 proof).  I hate wine\ldots  but I love bombay sapphire (which is 94-proof)\ldots  since i am heavier than most people (6'3' and 270lbs) I felt confident i could handle more alcohol than the standard dose.



The enema applicator holds 6oz of fluid (it looks like a turkey baster with a very thin 3'-long nozzle.  i heated tapwater to 99-degrees and checked it with a digital thermometer to not-burn myself.  I poured a 1oz shot of bombay sapphire into a true-lined 1oz shotglass (NOT 1.5 like many are) and sucked it up into the enema applicator.  i then squeezed-out the air i also sucked up and sucked-the remaining 5oz of water.  i put a small portion of Wett Platinum lube on my anus and completely-lubed the 3' tube applicator.  it slid-in very easily with no pain at all.  I squeezed the plunger and got the full 6oz of liquid in my ass.



t+0 OH MY GOD IT BURNS!  Burning sensation subsided within 20-seconds.



t+1 i feel like i need to poop a turd, i know not too and hold it



t+5 very warm sensation starts to envelop my head, like i just-did 4 shots of liquor in a row



t+20 feeling truely-drunk on 1shot of liquor!



t+40 room is spinning, feel like sleeping, very strong buzz



t+41 urg to poop is overwhelming, i run to bathroom and squirt what feels like a bad case of diharrea / hershey squirts, smells horrible



t+1 hour, buzz about same, still spinning



t+1.5 hour buzz wearing off



t+2 hours no buzz - i think to myself `this must be the crack-way of doing alcohol'\ldots  very low price and very intense buzz that doesn't last long.  the burning is very bad.  i would not try this again.
