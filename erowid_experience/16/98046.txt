I smoked a big bump of jwh-081 from a bowl full of ash before eating.  This drug has an uncanny come up of 3minutes.  So I went and cooked for about 5 minutes and brought my meal back upstairs where I consumed half a shot of 50 proof vodka.  My stomach was relatively empty and almost immediately after taking the shot I felt super drunk, probably 1-2shots drunk.  I also felt a strong indica like body buzz and a weed like mental state.  In general sedated, and relaxed.  There is some unwanted body tension in the jaw and face.  



I have to say that you shouldn't eyeball research chemicals, I've been working with jwh-081 for over a year, I bought a bunch and am still smoking it once in a while.  But even I shouldn't eyeball, I've had 3 separate over doses when eyeballing, and trust me you don't want to O.D. on this shit.



As far as the jwh-081 is concerned, I sometimes throw up, this is the same with jwh-122.  It greatly potentates the effects of alcohol, the spins come faster and vomiting is more likely.  Unfortunately being drunk and smoking 081 diminishes the positive mental effects of alcohol, mostly I get spaced like I've been doing alot of 3rd generation commercal blend Spice(10/2011-2/2012) and some weed.  The body high is nice though.



Be carful folks,  I just posted this because I'm shocked at how suddenly drunk I am from only a half shot of liqueur.
