Alright, I felt it time to post another trip report on my evaluations of 2-aminoindan, or 2-AI, which is basically a cyclic amphetamine, with the alkyl side chain attached back onto the benzene ring. My previous experiments included snorting it (extremely painful) and orally, which produced quite a strong painkilling effect, with little euphoria yet a strong awakening effect, as I imagine modafinil (which I have not yet taken) to be.



This time, at the end of a tiring day, smoking a fair amount of good weed throughout the day, (time is 02.55am) I weighed out 100mg, dissolved it in 2.5ml of tap water, and plugged it.



No ongoing medication taken, 10 bag of good skunk smoked throughout the day, and two cups of kratom tea, with a fair tolerance to opioids, no caffeine intake save a few sips of coke hours earlier in the day.



Set: moderately tired, bored, listening to music, more or less bollocks all to do.



Setting: my bedroom, alone, listening to music.



I waited around 10 minutes, feeling a moderate effect, so I decide it would be prudent to try a second dose, to get a feel for this compound, a further 100-mg was measured and plugged.



By T-15 minutes the 2-AI had made itself fully felt, pulse fast and strong, quite considerable euphoria, a very clean headspace, I would say slightly more stimulation than a moderate dose of amphetamine, but the headspace far far FAR clearer, very clear mind, if I were in company, I am quite sure I would be talking my arse off, sort of electric body high, feeling of pleasant tension in the calf muscles.



There is intense focus, and motivational effect, I feel like I could easily get down to doing work, if I had anything that actually needed doing. I went from tired, as I have to be up tomorrow fairly early to claim jobseekers allowance, to wide-eyed and fully alert, I am going jobhunting later tomorrow with a friend so I should stay awake all night and be quite ready to face my public, I may redose tomorrow morning, and sleep everything off in the afternoon, substance willing of course, after my last experience I know benzos+promethazine, my usual combination for sleep will be totally overpowered, so I won't waste any sleep aids this time. 



Overall, there is quite a bit of euphoria, very clean stimulation, not nasty and tweaky like dirty UK amphetamine paste, but wired and very pleasant up, nonetheless, rectally, its a whole different ballgame to snorting or orally which although providing pain relief, failed to produce any significant euphoria.



I think I might try 2-AI intravenously, I can't stand needles, but with a 31 gauge, I might just be able to push myself to do it, I certainly wouldn't mind trying that, perhaps combined with a dose of GBL.
