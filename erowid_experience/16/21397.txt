As I read the following I thought, wow you should try this, seems not that neurotoxic like amphetamine.



From the Smart Drugs News, Vol.3, No.8: `Adrafinil selectively stimulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, increasing alertness and sensory vigilance. Unlike other stimulants, such as amphetamines, Adrafinil does not cause anxiety and agitation, nor does it induce a need for 'rebound sleep.' Many other stimulants act as re-uptake inhibitors, increasing the levels of various neurotransmitters in the synapses. Adrafinil achieves its effect by binding to norepinephrine receptors directly, a very specific mode of action which greatly reduces the amount of unwanted side-effects. Moreover, the effect of this drug appears to be localized in the CNS, not stimulating the peripheral system to a significant degree.'





Well I took 300mg, and waited about one hour. Nothing. Took another Tbl. with 300mg. Again nothing. Then I thought, well take one more, and if its still inactive resell it to someone else. So I took another 300mg.



Waited, and waited, and the only thing that happened was, I was getting extremely tired, but was unable to sleep. Very unpleasant.



So my suggestion is, for everyone who searches for something that keeps you awake, take Yohimbine-HCL instead - Not Adrafinil. This medication is in my opinion totaly useless. No idea who put this on the pharma market.
