In a certain period of my life I was very sad and decided to try this kampu, better known as kambo or kampo in Brazil. A kind of home remedy for many Amazonian indigenous groups, kambo is a secretion taken from the Phyllomedusa bicolor frog when it is under stress.



An Indian friend agreed to give me the treatment. He would give me at least three applications, every thirty days. I'll now recount the first.



It was noon. Before starting, he told me to drink a liter of papaya juice with water. He made five `points' (small burns) on my arm with a smoldering vine. The `injection' (application of the secretion to the wounds) hurt a little. But I did not care, and was talking. Inside, I felt a little courageous.



For about twenty to thirty minutes I felt a very strong effect. My heart was pounding arrhythmically. My head was throbbing and I felt heavy. Sweat ran down my forehead. I felt nausea and a slight shiver throughout my body, as if `threads' ran through me. These threads felt as if `they' had volition of their own. It was unlike any other feeling I had ever had before. And I've experimented with quite a lot. My friend had explained to me earlier: `Kampu warms our blood and our head.'



Groggy, I tried to vomit or defecate, but nothing came out. `Okay then\ldots ' I thought. Then I lay down. Within me there was a festival of uncontrolled feelings, bad and new. After a while, my friend told me to sit down and wet the burns on my arm with water. I asked: `Why are you doing this?' `For you to throw up,' he replied. Not long after, I vomited. It was a single, sudden stream, and it almost escaped all over me. I vomited through the mouth and nose at the same time. I had never before vomited through my nose. Yuck! Very strange. There was a horrible taste in my mouth and nose, which lasted until the next day.



Then I lay down again, with my hand on my head. My friend came near and sang a song. He stood over me, and made some movements with his hands. I didn't see them as my eyes were closed. They made a little nice breeze on me. It felt like he knew what he was doing, that there was some kind of knowledge present--and this comforted me a little. I went to the bathroom again. I looked in the mirror. I was so ugly. Ave Maria. My eyes red, sinking inwards. Or perhaps it was my cheeks and mouth that were all swollen. Bia the Frog.



The effect was going away, and things were calming down. I asked my friend about the experience, and he told me: `You threw up, and that is good. But you vomited little; you did not arrive to the yellow color yet. Your spirit is still dirty; you need to clean it more.'



Final Note

I still can't tell whether I benefited from kambo. In the first few days following my initial experience, nothing in particular caught my attention. But about five days later I began to feel something of the frog inside me. I dreamed twice of a green frog. It was the frog and me, me and the frog. Might I have been influenced because I had been reading about it?



The second application included seven `points' (burns). This time I was badly treated, and began to find the frog somewhat mean. Either way, the scar that is on my arm--a series of small holes aligned horizontally, which stung until they healed-- still gives me a pleasant feeling of strength.
