Me and a bunch of friends got together for a friend's birthday.  My evil scientist friend brought some 2C-T-7 for us to enjoy.  As we were preparing to snort it, he warned us that it was going to burn, but only for about 15 minutes.  I snorted a small line and MY GOD IT BURNED LIKE HELL!  My eyes were tearing, my throat was on fire, I was dying from the pain in my nose!  To make matters worse, I began tripping very quickly.  I was sweating, I had tears running down my face, snot coming out of my nose\ldots I was crouched over the toilet coughing, hacking, and waiting to vomit.



I was drinking water, I made hot tea, I had toilet paper up my nose.  I started to trip very hard and was very delusional.  It was difficult to walk and to pour the much needed water into a glass.  In about 30 minutes, I was still burning and I got extremely nauseous.  I started to throw up in the toilet and another girl was puking in the sink next to me.  I felt like I would never stop throwing up; it just kept on coming.



I had difficulty moving and functioning.  All the lights in the house were red, so the visuals didn't seem that bad.  When I went to the bathroom (again), I turned on the bright white light and I was visual hallucinations that everything was moving.  Little specks of dirt on the floor looked like bugs crawling around.  The visuals were not pleasant.  I turned the light off very quickly.



The drug made my body very uncomfortable.  I was sweating one minute and freezing the next.  All of my muscles felt tense and sore.  My face was bright red and burned a little from the puking.  After I had thrown up, the severity of the effects slowly began to go away. 



The effects lasted for about 6 hours altogether.  The first hour were severe tripping and feeling dissociated.  About 2 hours after that were mild hallucinations and discomfort.  The last 3 hours were a feeling of general annoyance (as when coming off LSD).  It was hard to fall asleep and I kept waking up.  The next day I felt like a zombie--my brain felt fried and my body was extremely sore.  The night afterwards, I also had difficulty sleeping and woke up many times during the night.      



I will never put myself through this again.  A friend of mine said what we went through for this trip was `in league with satan.'
