I decided that I would try more melatonin that I normally use just to fall asleep (3mg works well just to fall asleep).



I took it, and then about 15 minutes later went to sleep (about 4am). I fell asleep very easily and slept pretty well. I did not wake up extremely refreshed (the feeling I get when they've slept too much). This is probably due to my not getting very much sleep during the previous week, rather than the melatonin.



I had extremely involving dreams, very vivid with lots of energy. In fact, when I woke up at about 1pm and went back to sleep, I could easily get the same dream back, which I had until about 3:30pm when I finally woke up.



It was very interesting and was so vivid that I had a slight feeling of exhaustion (not really sure why). 



I don't think it affected the nature of my dream (what kind it was, and whether I would enjoy it or not), however.
