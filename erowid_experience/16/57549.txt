I noted the peak to be about 2hrs 30 minutes and the total duration about 4 hours.



T

Snorted 7.5mg



T +15min

feeling the onset now. I was clear-headed, energetic, and a lot more focused than I usually was. I decided to take this opportunity to do my English homework, to my amazement I was actually enjoying doing it whereas usually I find myself making every little excuse to get out of it but in contrast I was actually putting off other things for my English.



T + 1hr 

The first hour flew by as I was doing my homework, at around the T +1hr mark I felt to feel a bit depressed because I wasn't able to do two things at once, I basically felt like I was underachieving for some odd-reason,or like I was coming-down. 



T+1hr 20min 

the peak had stabilized and I felt good again. I started to suck the roof of my mouth like I do on coke or MDA



T + 1hr 45min 

I started to notice some euphoria which could be best compared to a cocaine buzz. I found myself taking those deep, pleasurable breaths and often lying back on my bed and just enjoying the fluttering in my chest. 



T + 2hr 45min

The cocaine feeling has started to subside and continuously sucking the roof of my mouth is starting to annoy me.



T + 3hr

The peak is basically over. I am slowly losing the desire again to do any school work but start on my Computing Homework to make the most of what's left.



T + 4hr

back to base. feeling very hungry `cause I have barely eaten all day. and tired. 



Overall, This was very useful as a study aid but I also noticed some euphoric sensation which I wasn't expecting reading other reports.
