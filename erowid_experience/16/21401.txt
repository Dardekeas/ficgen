 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\#  



The first time I was made aware of the possibility of using butane was at a freinds house. My freind who we all know affectoinately know as `retard' was standing in a corner sucking greedily on a can of butane. He began to luagh profusely and said that he could see through time. I thought it must be good shit so I tried a small hit, it tasted metallic and pleasant. I got a minor head spin, very slightly giddy with mild euphoria, like a dilute versoin of the effects of nitrous oxide.



I never thought about again until `the retard' dropped over many days (weeks?) later. Me, the retard and my brother were keen on getting high. The retard brought cream chargers, a can of butane, and a sad substitute for absinthe (vodka+wormwood). The `absinthe' was a total fucking waste, I could only handle about three or four shots (more than most people I know who try and drink that crap!) The cream charges were fun but were over much to quickly. With the last few charges I sucked in a lungful of Butane afterwards in an attempt to prolong the effect. It did little to prolong the euphoria, but the patterns and fuzzieness of sight \& sound lasted longer. It was only after the charges ran out that we hit the butane HARD! If it wasn't for desperatoin I don't think I'd even try butane, let alone keep at it, but we were all determined to get really fucked up.



I experienced weird colours, buzzing, repetive auditory hallucinatoins, tingling, the usual crap. What was more noticable and butane-specific is how it affected the way we thought. I felt dislocated and unreal wandering around the house, it was only when seated in front of the television that it really got good. We were laughing hysterically at the afternoon cartoons, they seemed unbeleivable strange, it wasn't like the way you get the giggles when your stoned. It was much more severe, the luaghter more severe, so was the weirdness. I kept turning to my brother or `the retard' and asking wether the show I was watching was really as completely fucked up as it seemed. It was the trippiest T.V. experience I've ever had. The thing I found is that Butane make familiar things seem extremely alien without changing their appearance. At this point however I could still recognise objects and people, soon that would change.



Sitting in front of the T.V. luaghing at an incomprehensible stream of sensory stimulus was the highlight of the experience, from then on it degenerated into a disgustingly depraved butane binge. Me and the retard left my brother at our home while we went walkabouts. The can we had shared was empty so we wandered into a petrol statoin and bought 2 more. One of the good things about butane is the price (4\$ Australian). We wandered around concealing the cans in the sleeves of our jacket, inconspicously sucking away. I went into McDonalds and had a Romano burger, something I would regret later. We wandered onto the phantom road, a cut off by new roads, obsolete, a tarmac island floating in a sea of tall yellow grass. We camped down near the phantom road and began to suck away. The next few hours are lost to me forever. 



The next thing I remember was looking at a strange gray pattern, I looked at it for what seemed a very long time before realising it was the sky. I realised then that if I was looking up at the sky, then I was lying on my back. I sat up and looked around. I saw a weird shape, part of my brain suggested this was human known as `the retard' but most of my mind seemed doubtful, I tested this by calling to him and was genuinely suprised when he responded.



After that I felt extremely nauseas, a sick combinatoin of butane, wormwood and mcdonalds. I retched numerous times but couldn't seem to vomit. I coughed up masses of white froth, tinged ever so slightly with green (fucking wormwood). We staggered back and I went to bed immediately. I felt sick and fatigued with a headache. 



This was the only time I've gotten butane sick and it has tuaght me moderatoin. I've only used Butane about 4 or 5 times, I'm certain prolonged use has unpleasant side effects, however `the retard' would be more qualified to talk about that than I having used it much more often and in conjunctoin with other things. Also butane is much more of a mind fuck than pot, especially in large quantities. For a fun experience with inhalants I prefer Nitrous oxide or even varnish fumes. I may use it again, but I'm not in any kind of hurry.
