Back during High School, I once went into the woods with some friends to smoke a massive amount of weed and then go to the local Ice Skating rink and Arcade. We all had brought our own bags of weed, and had a couple pipes. We sat and smoked for quite a while. Now, all but one of us had just plain weed. One kid, without knowing, had bought some weed laced heavily with angel dust. I always was the old iron lungs, so after everyone else had had enough, I kept going, but the only bag left was the laced kind. So I smoked the rest of the bag, and it had been half full. The bag had been about a nice 30 bag. Anyway, so now we are all done, and we head to the sporting center, but immediately we noticed something wasn't right\ldots 



We had to take a trail through the woods to get there, and we all noticed that it felt as though the ground were tipping back and forth and balance was extremely difficult to maintain. Also, we noticed we weren't able to feel very much and were getting some tunnel vision. Somehow, we made it to the place though and went inside. We thought better than to go ice skating as that could be quite dangerous considering our states at the time.



However, we went into the arcade, and then we started to feel violent. There was one of those games where you hit the plate with a giant mallet and it sends the little thing up to hit the bell if you win. There was no mallet, so in my altered state of mind, I punched the metal plate as hard as I could, and it EASILY rang the bell. It also left some blood from my badly damaged hand behind on the plate. I didn't feel a thing of this till a couple days later but I will get to that. I then went to go play lazer tag in this blacklight arena with loud music and crazy light effects. I got very paranoid and thought that the red flashing lights were the police. I saw another player come around a corner and shoot me with the lazer gun. I thought he was a cop at the time so I punched him square in the face and RAN. My friends realized that the police would soon actually be there as they were more in control than me cause they had smoked less of the dust. They dragged me out the door screaming and we ran into the woods towards home.



Before the laser tag, I had spent alot of time at the arcade, so this running into the woods is roughly 8 hours after having smoked. I get home with my one friend who sleeps over. I then wake up the next morning and still feel just as crazily high as the night before. It didn't worry me, I just figured I had done alot the last night and it would wear off in a couple hours. Unfortunately for me, the feeling lingered on for 5 days. I felt flu-like symptoms with it, but also could barely feel much, and I felt extremely dissociated and disoriented. I had to go to school like this too, it was terrible. My other friends who did it had the same problem I did. One of them lasted 5 days like I did, and two others lasted only 3 days. It was a frightening experience and I don't think I will ever do that stuff again.
