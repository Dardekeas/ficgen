My wife suffers terrible cluster migraine headaches. After exhausting conventional therapies prescribed by headache specialists, I decided to help my wife by growing some psilocybin after reading ad hoc reports of efficacy.



I had picked two abhorts (baby mushrooms that stopped growing) since I read that they still had a good dose of psilocybin. I dried them while the outdoors patch continues in its first flush.  When a headache hit last night, I cleaned out the coffee grinder, and ground the dried mushies and then mixed them in a small glass of orange juice.



After giving her the juice she fell asleep around a half hour later (she regularly sleeps at 10 PM).  At about 10:20 she awoke from a `bad dream, with all sort of monsters and things.'  She concluded the psilocybin was working.  Her headache had also lessened significantly, and it was completely gone the next morning.



Her headaches can run 3 days, so this an unusually short, and very bad only before the pysilocybin dose.



This is an encouraging first report. I'll write again, once we've had several months data on this alternate therapy.
