Well, I'm still coming down from the trip so please excuse spelling and so on. Probably a very stupid idea; writing while intoxicated. But please bear with me. I don't know how much of this I will remember tomorrow. 



Location: My bedroom.



Mindset: Felt a little blue but not depressed.



Peparation of seeds: Scraped of the coating with a knife. Chewed and swallowed.



Sitter: None



I munched down 5 seeds 5 hours ago. Rinsed them down with water.



`Bout one hour after consumtion I was gettin real worried and felt very dizzy. I was gettin a little paranoid (well, not just a little; I started to think that I never be normal again). 



The body felt very light. It still does. Not very pleasant though. Although I felt bad and still feel a little weird. I haven't had that much trouble with nausea. 



I felt really long and got scared that if I'd fall to the ground I would break. I had to remember to breathe, `cause if I didn't I would stop breathing and that would hardly be good. 



Not much visuals. But everything looks strange. Some things seem very big, other things; small. 



Thoughts rushing trough my head made it very hard to relax. I tried to get some sleep but my head simply wouldn't calm itself down. Although I was to tired I felt that if I couldn't get to sleep I would break down and cry, I still couldn't get to sleep. 



Overall a rather scary and unpleasant experience. Not something I would recommend for anyone interested in trippin'.
