I was introduced to it my freshman year in high school.  I am a junior now and I've spent the last two years putting all the spare change I've had up my nose.    



Let's just say I started out doing maybe 10 or 20 milligrams a day and I've gone up to doing 80 a day and not just doing a few lines, I've started shooting up, only because it's new and it kicks it in much faster, and I'm trying to convince myself it's just a phase.  I lost a lot of weight (which I was actually quite happy about), my skin and eyes look like crap though.  Just so tired and worn, and a constantly itchy nose. In the last 6 months I've spent about 1,500 dollars on it and it's sent a very good friend of mine to jail and a few others to the methadone clinics. 

 

But the fact is, it still is wonderful and I can't really stop.  I've finally been able to tone down my usage, and only use in large amounts once or twice a month.  These fun little parties that I throw for my nose are so much better when I haven't done any in two weeks.   I've decided that I love oxy and I don't really regret anything except that someday when I look back on my high school years I fear I will realise I spent them all consumed in an addiction.
