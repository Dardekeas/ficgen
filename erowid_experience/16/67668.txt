About two months ago, I was diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. The psychologist recommended me to the psychiatrist in the facility, and he or she recommended Hydroxyzine (50mg) and Busparone (15mg) although I do not use the hydroxyzine. 



Anyway, I took the buspar as recommended, in the morning, so that the effects would last all day (medicinally). I noticed, VERY QUICKLY after about 10 minutes of injesting the Buspar that I was becoming extremely lightheaded to the point where it was slightly irritable. For instance, I was at work the day I began the Buspar. As I walked down the hallway of my building, I noticed my body would not stop walking even though my mind kept screaming `STOP WALKING\ldots STOP WALKING!' however I reacted after about 2 seconds of this. 

It seems as though maybe there was a slight delay in the listening to what people were saying, as if it were some type of psychological echo, possibly hallucinagenic. 



Overall, I enjoyed the experience because I took it the next day (as prescribed). These effects did NOT wear off and I did NOT experience a decrease in anxiety or panic attacks, and these symptoms (lightheadedness and CNS lag of response) did not subside either.
