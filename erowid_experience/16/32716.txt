I am male, 85kg and have no opiate dependence whatsoever.



7.15PM - Took 150mg of generic brand tramadol orally. 



7.25PM - Ate a sandwich before feeling any effects. 



7.30PM - 1st mild effects felt (Have to concentrate hard to notice.  Thought it could have been placebo, but, in hindsight, it was certainly the start of the `come-up').



8.30PM - Now experiencing a very mild (but quite pleasant) opiate style stone. Some nausea (very mild again\ldots  just a feeling of slight queasiness). Appears to take some time to take affect fully.



9.00PM - Effect has deepened a little (pupils very slightly contracted and that `squeezy' feeling behind the eyes that accompanies it). Queasy sensation persists. 



10.30PM - Effects are still intensifying. Not `noddy' at all, but pleasantly mellowed with a slight `stimulant' style effect in the background\ldots  Definitely worth trying in its own right (very curious to see how it reacts with Kratom.) 



11.30PM - Seems to have reached a plateau. Definite `speedy' sort of feeling along with a mild euphoria. Slightly itchy around the face, queasiness has totally gone, now. 



3.15AM - It's difficult to sleep on this\ldots  Effects are starting to wear off (down to about 60\% of the peak) 



8.00AM - Still feeling some effect - about 40\% of the peak\ldots  (hard to put a figure on it). Could not sleep for the life of me.
