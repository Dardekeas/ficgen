Last night I unwittingly combined DMAE with weed brownies to discover the second most intense trip of my entire life.  I take DMAE as a mild stimulant on dark wintery days.  My friend made some brownies that I ate merely because they were right there in front of me.  At no time had I thought the DMAE would inject THC warp speed into my body.



This is a trip of deadly intensity.  I felt completely out of time and mostly out of my body.  I knew where I was and who I was, but at the same time was completely out of reality in a most uncomfortable fashion.  I have nearly a decade of drug abuse under my belt, but this experience was too much too swallow.  I found out that the `better place' really isn't that swell.  



I wound up begging my friends to take me to the ER for the deliverance of the valium injection.  They declined so I resorted to a homemade concoction of various downers I found within my medicine cabinet.  I was asleep within 2 hours of the experience starting, yet these were two of the longest hours I can remember.



This report exists as a warning any potential experimenters out there.  This combination is too potent for mere mortals.  There was nothing pleasant about it.
