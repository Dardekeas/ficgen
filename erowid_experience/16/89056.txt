[Erowid Note: This report contains a common misinterpretation of the DEA's Nov 24 2010 \href{http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/cannabinoids/cannabinoids\_law1.shtml}{notice of intent} to emergency schedule five synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists. For current law updates about Spice-like products and synthetic cannabinoids, see \href{http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/spice\_product/spice\_product\_law.shtml}{Spice Law Page}]



When I first found out about `SPICE' or Synthetic Cannabinoids. I thought, `yeah right'\ldots Well in September of 2010 (long before this experience) I was first introduced. So when I found out the DEA, at the end of November 2010, put 5 of the highest potent Cannabinoids (JWH-018, JWH-073..etc..) on the Controlled Substance Act, making it a schedule 1 drug, which by the way is the worst list of schedule drugs to be on.

       



                       ***THE PURCHASE***



After being informed of this before it happened by my Local Head Shop Owner, , he assured me that there will be `BAN-COMPLIANT' Cannabinoids/Synthetic Cannabis. So when the Act was signed, I figured it would be a waste of time to go. However, one day I went. The stuff I used to buy `Funky Monkey' was still there, however I didn't notice the new sticker on the bottle. It said, `Ban Compliant  Does Not Contain JWH-018\ldots etc' So like anyone else, I was indeed skeptical. The spice did in fact look different. So I purchased the same stuff I always have for 4grams for \$15.99, and to me that is a very good deal.



                        ***THE EXPERIENCE***

         

7:00 pm.  After getting into the car, I kept saying, `DAMN!! There are no refunds here, I Hope I didn't make a money mistake.'

          

..I didn't want to wait until I got home, so..



7:10 pm I rolled a Pin Pin Pin, and I mean small little joint of it. Just enough to taste it!! As soon as I tasted the first hit, I knew it was different. 



(7:30 (pm)  smoked a couple regular sized bowls.  



(9:00 pm)  I rolled a Regular Sized Joint. 



I have to admit, it does the same thing as the ILLEGAL kinds, that the DEA chose to make ILLEGAL at the end of Nov. 2010. It takes maybe 3 more hits than normal to achieve my normal level of high. So in other words, the `BAN-COMPLIANT' Synthetic Cannabinoids/Spice is not as potent, but trust me, it does what I am expecting. TRUST ME!!

         

11:45-11:55 pm (2 or 2 and a Half Hours after the Regular Sized Joint) feeling stable and good while typing this. It is amazing how little I need to achieve a `good high'. A half or a whole  Regular Metal Bowl is all I need, and my tolerance is some-what high. I do want to smoke another couple of bowls before I call it a night.



So to put a long story, and a good one, short.. The `BAN-COMPLIANT' Synthetic Cannabinoids/Spice does do what I want and expect it to do, however it is NOT as potent as the ones that are BANNED by the Drug Enforcement Agency. Would I Recommend It To Someone Else? Yes, I guess all Cannabinoids do the same thing, just some do it better. LOL! Overall, My Experience with Synthetic Cannabinoids on Januaray 4th, 2011 was worth the money spent.



***********Now I am anxious to know what Chemical (JWH-018,JWH-073,etc..) is in the `BAN-COMPLIANT' version.***************



All in All, I enjoyed my night!!
