My boyfriend boiled 4 tablespoons of bark in water for about half an hour, getting a nice and red tea. We normally have it with honey, which makes it taste really nice, but this time we used a little bit of sugar.



I sat at my computer a worked for a little bit. Then I really felt like singing. My voice comes out surprisingly clear every time I drink it. I can reach higher notes than normal without too much effort.



I was starting to feel a little sweaty after a while. The room felt quite hot. Then I also noticed that I was getting really wet down there (though not horny).



When I got into bed with my boyfriend, he looked so beautiful and felt amazing. We kissed, and the kiss felt more sensuous than usual. He stroked my back, and I felt tingles all over. Each touch was heavenly.



He was erect and hard before I got into bed. But when me made love, it was even bigger and harder. We both had a really intense orgasm.



After that I fell asleep. My boyfriend had trouble sleeping, and ended up being awake in bed for another two hours.



This is what has happened for the last three times we used yohimbe. 



I would also like to mention that I have tried meditating on yohimbe, but it makes it hard to focus. My mind is more likely to drift off into random thoughts about the last South park episode, so it's not particularly helpful in that sense.
