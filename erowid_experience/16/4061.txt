A fellow sitting next to me at the bar last saturday night told me

that he had excellent results with tiny doses of 2ct2 if he took them right before going to bed. He claimed that in small amounts, the medicine had therapeutic value. He would sleep more soundly, and the next day wake up refreshed. His mind felt younger, as if he we a young man in his 20s. Works best on a crisp, clear winter morning, he said. The colors were finer and more distinct, smells and aromas sharper and lively, interactions with people calmer and more sophisticated. 



From his description, the medicine has the power to stimulate the mind in constructive ways. You don't necessarily need to use it to have an overwhelming experience at the moment. It can be appreciated for its delayed subtleties as well. He also hinted that with sex his sensitivty to skin textures and body energies became improved. I nursed my scotch and took in all he had to say, and then went to the restroom. When I returned, he had departed from the establishement, and I never met him again. A most interesting tale.
