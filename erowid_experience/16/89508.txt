After finally finding a source of relatively potent liquid GHB, I had my chance to try this drug of which I'd researched and become increasingly curious to its effects. My first time trying the drug was at home with three other friends. I decided (as it was only my first time) to try consuming 1ml of the solution. The taste of the liquid was disgusting, however this was because it had been stored in an old mouth wash container, giving the liquid a strong minty flavour. I washed it down with lemonade and then began to watch a movie. The 1ml dose did little for me, I felt a slight buzz, like I'd consumed 1 or 2 drinks of alcohol. I increased my dose from then on to 1.5ml, to 2ml, and finally to 2.3ml. My first experience with the latter dosage is nothing short of amazing. 



The first time trying this dose (2.3ml) was at a dance party. I had pre-prepared my doses the night beforehand and had them in tiny plastic bottles. After about 15 minutes of consuming the first dose, I began to feel slightly off balance, the deep beats of the music was hitting me in my chest, and I began to really enjoy the social atmosphere of the dance party. I wanted to talk to people, make friends, dance, and just be around others. This is why I feel GHB has been likened to MDMA, although completely different chemicals, they both enhance the social experience in such a wonderful way. 30-40 minutes after initial dosing, my vision had become blurred and I felt very inebriated and relaxed. At this point I was dancing, my entire body was buzzing, and the music sounded amazing. The GHB did not alter my thoughts or make me feel out of control at any time, I felt comfortably intoxicated and in control of my movements and actions. I found once peaking, that the combination of GHB and the lasers and lighting at the event made it very difficult to focus, and my vision was inhibited by the GHB. This caused me to become less coordinated, and walking straight took a lot more effort. After around 40 minutes, the peak of these effects lasted for about an hour, and then slowly tapered off. After 2 1/2 hours from taking the dose, I felt `sober'. 



I have used GHB a number of times since, and I have never experienced a hangover (even after consuming a total of 7-8mls over an event) I feel this drug is a great alternative to other substances (particularly alcohol), however I have seen first hand how dangerous it can be. I feel most of the dangers of using GHB can be avoided if I have set doses, and set dose times, especially when I plan on consuming a large amount of GHB over a period of time. I find my preferred dose in a safe environment, and stick to that dose, setting the times when I will take the doses, spacing at least 2 hours between these times.
