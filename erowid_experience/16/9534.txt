I have experimented with hallucinogens and other such substances many times in my life, this experience with HBW seeds was by far the most mentally intense experience of my life. A 13 hour voyage into the deepest and most unimaginable thoughts in my mind.



I ordered the seeds off of an internet site and they were said to be `potent'. After reading about suggested doses and what to expect from these HBW seeds, I decided to take 8 seeds ground up and soaked in water. I took more that was suggested, but I wanted to experience the full effect of LSA without any side effects. I was careless and got what I deserved. 



An hour into the trip I got that acid onset feeling in my stomach, that soon turned into nausea, but I was sitting most of the time in the beginning so it wasn't unbearable. I was experiencing very rapid eye movements, lights and colors were more defined, some `breathing' was seen on flat surfaces. As I approached the third hour of my trip, the intensity was still increasing at a steady pace, I knew I was in for a night of pure insanity, and that wasn't far off.



Somewhere between the 4th and 5th hour, I got locked into an ever expanding loop of unrealistic thoughts, aspirations, inspirations, etc. Paranoia to its fullest extent. I didnt know what to expect and because the trip kept getting more and more intense I didnt think it would end, and if it did, I knew I'd be changed. Time slowed down so much, half hour cartoons fealt like an eternity, to this day I still cannot figure out how or when one show ended and the other began. At one point I looked at the alarm clock and it was five minutes earlier than when I had last looked at it.



The thought of that night, to this day, gives me the chills and sends me into a dazed state of confused thoughts. Would I do it again? Yes, but a lot less, the initial effects were desirable.
