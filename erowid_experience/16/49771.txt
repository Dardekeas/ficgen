Wow.  To see Albert Hofmann and hear him talk about his compound was one of the most moving experiences of my life.  The last night, when we all sang Happy Birthday to him was positively transcendent.  The intensity of LOVE reverberating throughout the room and settling on Albert was beautiful, exhilirating, nourishing and cosmic.  Of course, dancing to the Bardo Blues and listening to Ralph Metzner's poetry was another high light.  Turn up that LoveLight and Leave It On!



One of the most memorable people I met was a woman who told me that she was 56 years old, from Basel, and she had been treated with LSD in therapy in the 1970's.  She said she took it 35 times over a period of 8 years of therapy and credited LSD with saving her life.  She was the consumate picture of a successful, professional woman.  She came to the seminar to show her appreciation and find out more about LSD.  She personifies the reason we need to be up front and honest about the power of LSD and that using it is a positive thing.



   (Then there was Rupert\ldots ..what a trip he is!!!)



The organizers did an incredible job\ldots it was the best vacation I've ever had and a happening I will remember forever.
