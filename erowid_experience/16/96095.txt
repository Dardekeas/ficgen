I have previous experience with methylphenidate (generic/instant release) and found that it was an excellent mood enhancer and short-term study aid. In the past I have combined methylphenidate with alcohol and found the combination to be significantly more euphoric than methylphenidate alone. Given these good experiences, I was excited when I found ethylphenidate available online from a reputable supplier. 



Before taking a serious dose I first conducted an allergy test (est. consumption 1 - 5 mg). When no ill effects where experienced I proceeded to take the equivalent of a 20 mg oral dose. After about twenty minutes I began to feel focused and alert. At this point I decided to take a trip to the liquor store to get some red wine for later in the evening. I drove with the windows open and the breeze felt much better than normal - almost enough to give me pleasant chills but not quite. I felt aware and cognizant of all other vehicles on all sides of my ride.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



At the liquor store I found myself fluidly making small talk with the cashier as I paid (a rare feat for me. After an enjoyable ride home the first dose was wearing off and I decided to try insufflation. I lined up about 20 mg of the powder and proceeded to insufflate with the rolled up receipt from the liquor store. It kicked in nearly instantly with a mild burning sensation in the nostrils and a medicine-tasting drip in the throat. Whereas an oral dose was like methylphenidate but shorter-lived and more euphoric, the insufflated dose felt more like low quality cocaine than anything else. I felt instant dopaminergic stimulation and an unbearable drive to play Rocksmith on the PS3.



After getting high scores in a number of songs and beating previous records and starting to feel a comedown I decided to have another line. The effects were not diminished in comparison to the first line. After that dose started to wear off I had a glass of wine and a 1 mg etizolam. This successfully combatted the effects of the crash and allowed me to fall asleep easily. All in all, I found ethylphenidate to be an excellent and well-tolerated stimulant.
