After reading all there is to read about Peyote and San Pedro i wanted to try a mescaline trip.I found a 5 foot Trichocerus (thinking it was T.Peruvianus) and cut a 35cm-7cm piece off the top. The tip was cut off and went back in the soil to root.After removing the spines with little nicks, i peeled the silver-blue-green waxy skin off. It was extremly easy just like pealing a banana. Then i got a sharp knife and removed all the green flesh off,the rest was thrown away. I boiled the green flesh in 2L of tap water and 300ml fresh lemon juice. -Before boiling i tasted the cactus but it wasn't at all bitter but i continued anyway- After boiling the mixture for 2 hours i was left with a 650ml green liquid. It was very `Fat' like honey and very sour as i could taste the lemon juice. I drank half of it after mixing it with some fresh grapefruit juice and 100gr of sugar, just to kill the sour taste. I drank 325ml in 2 doses 15 min appart. 



The results:NOTHING HAPPENED 



After waiting for 3 hours i felt nothing -meanwhile i had a joint or two-

I was 100\% sure it was a Trichocerus and it looked like T. Peruvianus. I did all there is to do, i put it in the freezer for a night until rock solid and i didn't over cook it and i had nothing to eat for at least 8-10 hours.



In Erowid's picture gallery i found a `good tasting' Trichocerus but it looks nothing like mine.  To avoid making the same stupid mistake as i did, make sure you know for sure what kind of cacti you're using!!!
