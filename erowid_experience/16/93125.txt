9:15 -- Took 100mg of 6-apb and 750mg of magnesium orally. Started journey to beach



9:30 -- Arrived at beach.



9:55 -- First effects setting in, slight increase in heart rate, very mild stimulating effects.



10:00 -- Feeling a warming sensation emanating from my core, outwards to my extremities, notice the breeze on my skin more, very pleasant tactile sensations/



10:05 -- Noticing minor jaw tension, not too bad though. Took oral 500mg vitamin C chewable, sucked on it for a while, not noticing a change in pallet. Palms becoming sweaty/clammy. Feeling nice fuzzy feelings at my brain. Very pleasant.



10:20 -- Feeling more of a stimulant feeling.. Feel more awake. Breeze feels amazing. Noticing minor visuals out of the corner of my eyes. A red/blue outline/minor tracer surrounding objects as I move my head back and forth. Feeling more of a warming sensation washing over me.



10:25 -- Getting a sort of half yawn. Feeling very awake, not too much of a stimulant feeling.



10:35 -- Tried smelling vicks, took a big deep breath and it filled my body with amazing feelings, mouth is minorly dry. Eyes begin to bounce and shiver, very MDMA like. Palms more sweaty/clammy.



10:45 -- Feeling very warm and happy, cannot resist smiling.



10:50 -- Feeling very loose now. Noticing more visuals as I stare at the horizon, I see many multicoloured circles within circles. Outlines of clouds very intense. 



11:05 -- My buddy gave me a light show and got lost in the lights for a bit. Music/Auditory appreciation increased. A bit more jaw tension.



11:10 -- Ate some skittles, explosion of flavour in my mouth, sent shivers down my spine.



11:20 -- Feeling more happy, more good feelings all over.



11:30 -- Smoking feels amazing, feels much lighter on the lungs than normal.



11:30-11:45 -- Decided to go walk around the beach. Walking around in the sand feels incredible. Took a breath of Amyl Nitrate, got an amazing body rush and intensified visuals.



11:30-11:45 -- Played my didge for a bit. feeling very creative. My didge sounded much more amazing than usual.



11:50 -- Re-dosed with another 50mg of 6-apb orally.



12:05 -- I believe I have plateaued. Feeling over all amazing, very free, loose, and energetic.



12:15 -- Ate some pop rocks, awesome feeling but not as amazing as with MDMA.



12:15-12:30 Made the trek back to the car. Walking feels incredible still. Starting to come up a bit on the 2nd dose. Feeling more happy feelings. The walk back made me realize that I have been sweating a lot despite being very calm.



12:45 Feeling more awake. Not overpowering.



1:00 -- Did amyl nitrate again, got very strong euphoric feelings. Got a pretty intense head rush. Felt a bit of nausea but was quickly counteracted with vicks. Pop rocks again amazing.



1:10 -- My buddy started driving back to his place.



1:15 -- As 2nd dose is coming on stronger, I notice an elevated body temp. Very euphoric. Still feeling very free and all of my muscles feel very relaxed. Very pleasant feelings. Very much of a relaxed energy feeling. Minor jaw tension still prevalent. I began to drive home from my buddies place.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



1:15-1:50 -- Whole car ride and the majority of the come up from \#2 slight nausea, not bad at all though, dissipated as I drink some cold water. Near the end of the journey experienced slight hand cramps, went away quickly. Driving was very manageable, had some eye flutters while driving though. 



2:00-2:30 -- Recapped all the events in the car. Still feeling amazing. I decide to go take a shower.



2:30-3:30 -- Shower felt amazing. Got amazing closed eye visuals and slight open eye visuals. I have come to realize that it is very hard to multitask on this substance, very easy to get stuck doing the same thing even when you are planning on doing other things.



3:45 -- Took another 250mg of magnesium orally, laid down and began watching T.V. Feeling very pleasant all over and not tired at all. Feel very awake but not like an up from a stimulant other than the jaw tension.



4:30 -- Coming down now, still feel very pleasant all over.



6:00 -- Been watching T.V. relaxing. Come down is very gentile. Tried amyl nitrate again to see if they still affected me in the same way, they did, a little lessened euphoria though. Tactile sensations fading.



7:00 -- Back to baseline





Summary/Afterthoughts:



This is an amazing substance, extremely good body high, tactile sensation was probably the most prevalent feeling from this substance. I really liked the fact that it made me feel awake with out being overpowered with a stimulant feeling.
