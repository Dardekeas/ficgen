Well it was around 9:30, and I was chilling at a friends house planning to try dimenhydrinate. I took a total of 450mg. Below are the events that unfolded.



T: 9:35 pm -$>$ Took 350mg (7 pills) with a bottle of water. 



T: 10:35 -$>$ Feeling sight body high, very similar to DXM. Limbs are extremely heavy. I had to go to the bathroom VERY badly, I don't know if this was from the bottle of water or the pills. When I stood up it hit me fairly hard. It felt as if my body weight tripled, and although trying my hardest to walk normal, I did a zombie walk arcoss the hall to the toilet. When I sat back down I looked at the upper cornor of the wall in the room. It looked like is was pulsing and being distorted like a subwoofer does when you crank the bass up. Still visuals were very minor and I was fairly disappointed so I took 100mg (2 pills) more for a total of 450mg.



T: 12:05 -$>$ At this point I'm pissed. I've felt nothing beyond what was described above. The only explination I can think of at this point is that I was watching a movie, and I was so focused on the movie I killed my trip. I decide to go to sleep. What happens next was extremely interesting, and I didn't understand it until the next day. When I was lying in bed, I thought I was dozing in and out of sleep. I would close my eyes, but I could still see. To prove to myself that this was not possible I pulled my eyelids down with my fingers and held them shut. I saw black for about 5 seconds, then like magic, I could see the room again.



I was still holding my eyes shut. I looked around the room and saw my cell phone sitting on the nightstand. I took my finger off of my eyes and picked it up. I scrolled through it and made sure I had set a alarm on it for the morning, then set it back down on the nightstand. I closed my eyes for a couple of seconds and opened them. There was no nightstand in front of me, and my cell phone was sitting in the pocket of my shorts. `That's some weird shit' I thought, and I went back to sleep. The entire night was filled with extremely vivid dreams of things happening, I was talking to people, wandering around my friends house, wandering around in my house. When I woke up I just thought those were some wierd dreams, and drove home @ 7:30am.



T: 8:00 am -$>$ Driving home was normal, no problems or intoxicated feeling at all, just a bit groggy and and mild neausa. I get home and go back to sleep. THE SAME SHIT HAPPENS. As soon as I doze off I can see again. It was like my brains was making up situations and rooms from how I remember them. I'm starting understand this now, and freely allow myself to doze on and off into these `renderings' my brain has created. Nothing about this was weird as all these `dreams' (or where they?) were just of me chilling in my room. I woke feeling tired, but completely normal.



T: 11:00 am -$>$ I woke up and am trying to make sense of what happened. It's very weird because that morning I remember driving home with no problems; but now I can't remember driving home at all, or getting in my bed.





This was a very awkward trip. I plan on trying this again except using about 550mg-650mg, and having a sitter to watch exactly what I'm doing. My suggestions to people who would like to try this is start with a small dose. If I had done this during the day it's VERY possible that the results would be different. This is not a `cool' trip like LSD or shrooms. I don't get these heavy visuals like that, I see normal things and people, then just watch them disappear. It's interesting, but frightening.
