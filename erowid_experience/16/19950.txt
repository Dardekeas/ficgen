Just like the first few times I did acid, I didnt feel anything the first time I tried peyote. I didnt believe it was actually real, (people bullshit about stuff round here) but then I got some of it. I ate an eighth of dried crushed up peyote. It was pretty weird looking. A brownish red in color, other parts were brown or tan. And there were white and yellow fuzzie things too. Anyway, a bunch of people tripped off less than an eighth! I ate a whole one and nothing happened. I did take it with hawaian punch though\ldots  Maybe that has something to do with it not working. I tried it again a week later, and I ate even more, plus on an empty stomach and didnt drink, nothin but water. Again, nothing. 



Well Xmas came around and my friend really wanted me to see this stuff actually work. He gave me at least 75\% of an ounce of this crap. Christmas day, all my plans to see family got fucked up (weather, no one gets along, etc..) So I hadnt eaten since xmas eve, and it was about 4 pm. I proceed to choke down this horrible foul tasting crap. I ate about half of what I had\ldots  No, a lil more. I waited about an hour and a half. Nothing yet\ldots  Then maybe 15 minutes later I threw all that shit up. I was pissed, cause it was all right there staring back at me. Now it will never work I thought. So I ate the rest of it\ldots  It was really hard. After this, I smoked a ton of weed until I felt like I was rolling almost. But I had a bad gut rot feeling, like I ate 16 cough tablets. 



I was floating most of the time. Really euphoric. For the first 7 or 8 hours it was just euphoria, like floating feeling and body high. Drinking plenty of water\ldots  Then after watching lots of south park and laughing my ass off, I went upstairs and smoked some more. Then my carpet started turning into 3d textures like snowflakes and stuff. Pretty cool. I turn on the black light and everything looks really cool, but nothing really out of the ordinary. I felt like I took some acid, but not enough. But the body high/euphoria outweighed everything. Then later on, at like 4 in the morning, 12 hours after taking it, my stomach started to hurt really bad. I drank water and smoked to try to kill the pain, but no dice. I didnt feel like I had to puke but I just went over to the toilet anyway. It licked balls cuz the toilet still smelled like the first time I puked, so that made me start dry heaving. The most painful dry heaving you can imagine. Finally I puke, alot more than I thought I had in me. I feel a little better\ldots  But by now I'm so fucked up I dont even care I just want to sleep. I got pretty tired of the feeling and it just felt like I ate alot of cough medicine\ldots  Nasty. If I get the chance ill do it again, but I want fresh buttons, not the dry crap.
