I was bored one day so I decided to crack out these amitriptyline pills that had been lying around. I took two and waited for it to kick in. When it had kicked in, I instantly became incredibly tired, and just wanted sleep. After about 2 hours later I just could not take it any more so I went to bed at 10 p.m.

 

The next morning I awoke when someone woke me up and I had slept in  greatly. In school it was challenging to just keep awake. Finally school ended and I had woke up a bit more than in the morning.



In conclusion, it wasn't fun and all I got was extremely tired. It did make going to sleep a lot more comfortable, though.
