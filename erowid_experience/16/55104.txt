 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



Monday 7:30 a.m. I chugged a fifth of vodka and got smashed (normal routine for me)



10:00 a.m. I decided to chug another fifth (not routine) and from there I blacked out. Next thing I know it's 5:00 p.m. I went to the liquor cabinet and found it empty. OH SHIT! I had no money left, so I knew what comes next: HELL! I knew it was going to be a rough night, but not like I ever expected. One should know that I haven't touched alcohol since this happened, and I pray for those who still suffer such an affliction.



Anyway, I'm sure you heard about pink elephants? Well, it's not true. They are actually demons! HORRIBLE DEMONS!!!!! When the withdrawls began, I began to shake violenly. This was normal for me, considering that I went through it several times before. Then I blacked out again, which I didn't expect. I can only assume that it was a seizure. When I came to, it was around 2:00 a.m. That is when the hallucinations began.



I was sitting on the roof of a victorian style house lookin at the ground approx. 3 stories below. Sitting next to me was my fiance. The funny thing is that she died three years prior (I've been drinking non-stop since). She pointed to the lawn below and said, `You should be down there, Not up here.' After that she transformed into a nightmarish `THING' that I couldn't possibly describe in words without crying. `IT' then picked me up and threw me off of the roof. When I fell to the ground, it hurt. It actually happened? Not likely, but when I came out of my delirium, I realised I was wandering around in my neighborhood and there was a huge gash on my head. I had lost alot of blood. I happened to have my cell phone with me, so I called myself an ambulance, in which they treated me for my injury and detoxed me safely with librium.



Today I am alcohol free an happy.
