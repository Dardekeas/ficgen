I took `E' a couple times in high school and never quite enjoyed it, probably because I never truly got real MDMA. Years later, after being on prescription paxil for a few months and then quitting, I decided to try MDMA in an attempt to get rid of the paxil withdrawals/side effects and deal with my anxiety (the main reason I was on paxil in the first place). Before I go on, I should mention that I was basing my experiment on a few scientific studies I had read analyzing the possible benefits of MDMA and MDMA+SSRI's in treating anxiety, and a study that mentioned that SSRI's might actually cancel out the negative side effects (specifically lack of serotonin production) of MDMA, so I was eager to see for myself. 



I took a green euro pill (supposedly tested at an est. 90\%MDMA 10\%meth mix) and approx. an hour later took 20mg of paxil. The person I was with took a e-pill of the same type, but did not take any paxil. Throughout the night we both rolled hard, but I rolled happier. My roll did not consist of ANY negative feelings, while the girl I was with got a mild headache when we began to come down. The next day she was exhausted and felt a little `e-tarded', yet I felt refreshed like I had reached a new level of life. For the following weeks I also noticed that my anxiety was significantly reduced and everything seemed much happier in general. 



Since this little experiment I have combined MDMA with paxil several times, and now I do not EVER take paxil without E and never take E without paxil. So far, every time has been the same - EXCELLENT, with no negative side effects.
