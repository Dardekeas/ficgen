I first heard about 2-CI in the bathroom at my high school. A few of my friends were in there and they were talking about psychedelics. Me, being the drug fiend I am, was very interested. They were discussing something called 2-CI, which they claimed to be a synthetic candy-flip. So clearly, I was interested. One kid said he was going to order some soon, and so I hoped to obtain some when he did.



Now, let's back up. A little bit of important background in my life, I am diagnosed with Treatment Resistant Depression and at the time I was taking 1300 mg of Lithium daily, as well as 20 mg of Celexa daily. I always pride myself in doing research before I try a drug, and so I instantly looked for complications between these prescriptions and this famed 2-CI. I saw a few instances of seizure when Lithium was combined with LSD, however, I naively believed that I would be fine with 2-CI. That was a stupid assumption.



It started at a party. I was having a good time, smoking a few bowls and just chilling. And then all of a sudden my friend walks in the door saying he just bought fat doses of 2-CI. I was very interested, and excited. I without thinking paid the man for a dose, but alas, he had no scale. So he hand divided the doses, I got what I would estimate to be a very large dose, somewhere around 30mg of the stuff, maybe even more.



T +0:00 I take the dose in what I believe was a time release capsule at about 8 P.M. For the next two hours I feel like nothing is taking effect. I get a little bummed and take a trip with my friends to CVS.



T +1:30 We are at CVS and the initial visuals start. My mind seems really off too. Things start to move around a lot, although it's not as intense as I would have hoped it would be. At least, not yet.



T +2:00 We are back at my friends house at the party and I start to trip really hard. Everything looks like it is pixelated and the pixels are moving back and forth past each other really fast. I still have a small grip on my thoughts at this point however, this grip soon came to an end.



T +4:00 - T + 6:00 I am completely mental at this point. I honestly can't remember a single thing that actually happened at this point. All I can remember are the horrific, gory images flashing before my eyes. I was literally no longer in my friends house. I was in a house yes, but it was not a place that I recognized. The rooms were different. All I could see were my close friends, who were now gathered around me as I was completely delusional, being ripped apart by unknown forces. Peoples ears were being ripped off and they were bleeding from every part of their bodies. I remember at one point I bit my friends finger, and I could have sworn that I bit it off since I felt a pool of blood explode in my mouth. Although, in reality, I did not even break the skin. I would look down at my arms, and the scars and cuts I had there (from self-inflicted injury) were dancing around my arm. It was terrifying. These horrific images lasted for what I could only imagine was hours, however, I am a little shaky on the whole time factor seeing as I was tripping so insanely hard.



During this horrific aspect of the trip I had what was probably the most confusing revelation of my life. I remember I was sitting in a bath tub looking up at all my friends who were sitting around me on chairs. I don't believe this actually happened this way, but that is how I remember it. They were looking at me with smiles as I tried to process the meaning of life vocally. I remember saying something like, `It is the last thing you will expect to need that will save you.' And then all of a sudden, I figured it out, I honestly can't remember what the answer was. But all my friends (who probably were just a hallucination) cheered and said `You did it! You figured it out.' I instantly yelled at them, telling them they were cocksuckers and that if they knew what I was trying to figure out all that time they could have told me. Apparently I did yell at them, although they had no idea why I was yelling since they never actually talked to me about `figuring it out'. For awhile I remember stumbling around the house screaming `HOPE FOR THE FUTURE!' I felt really hopeful for some reason. Which is weird because I am a really depressed person.



T +7:00 - T +8:00 I remember at some point having what felt like a mildly lucid moment. I was on some bed with my girlfriend and I was trying to apologize to her for the horrific experience that I was putting everyone through. I was throwing up almost all night, and I was being extremely violent towards everyone I came in contact with. I even hit my girlfriend. I was out of control. However, while I was trying to speak to her, I couldn't do it. Literally, I stuttered over every word. It came out like I-I-I-I- a-a-a-m-m-m s-s-s-s-o-o-o-r-r-r-y-y-y. I couldn't stop talking like that. It scared the hell out of me. The next thing I remember I am walking out of the main house and towards the kid's garage. I climb the stairs to the finished part of the garage and see some kids playing video games. I look at the screen, and then something goes wrong. I feel my mouth twist to what felt like a vertical position, as opposed to the normal horizontal position. Blood poured from my mouth and I hit the floor. I was having a seizure.



T +9:00 - T +10:00 The next thing I remember I am in an ambulance. The officers and EMT's are all making fun of me for doing 2-CI seeing as they have never heard of it or anything. I remember being really disoriented and still very out of it. They gave me seizure medication and I spent the night hooked up to IV's in a hospital bed. To make things worse, I had visible self-inflicted cuts on my arm. And so, this trip to the hospital landed me in an inpatient mental program.



All in all, be careful what drugs you mix. The trip was \emph{horrific}, and when I say horrific I mean I had flashbacks and night terrors about the trip for over a month after it occurred. I am just finally starting to get over the experience three months later. I will never forget the horrific things I saw that night. The blood, the gore, the violence, the horror. It was scarring. I will also never forget that revelation I had. I still to this day ponder what `Hope' I figured out. I am sure that there are parts of the trip I don't remember, but I think that is for the best.



Please heed my warning, and be careful when you put substances into your body, especially when you are prescribed daily pharmaceuticals.
