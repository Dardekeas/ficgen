After reading about Damiana (tunera diffusa or turnera aphrodisiaca)being used as an aphrodisiac, I thought it would be fun to experiment with. I added two heaping teaspoons of the dried herb to one cup of boiling water, allowed it to steep for 5-10 minutes and added some honey as a sweetener. It was tasty! I drank this while smoking the remainder in a water pipe, which I read was the best way to smoke damiana. It was very smooth and enjoyable.



Within the hour I had begun to feel a very subtle but wonderful euphoria, a general sense of contentment and some sensory enhancement not unlike the first few moments when magic mushrooms start to kick in. Colours, sounds, awareness, and physical sensations were heightened noticeably but not to a great extent. People and objects had a faint glow/haze/fuzz around them. I couldn't stop smiling because I felt so absolutely relaxed and comfortable.



It lasted about an hour or two (hard to remember now). It didn't increase my sex drive, but it promoted a sense of well-being and intimacy that would likely lead one to a loving (not lusty) encounter. Highly recommend to lower inhibitions and make someone feel happy but not outright stoned. Good to use with a partner for a special night, or with someone you want to get closer to;)
