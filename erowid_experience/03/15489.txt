Paxil has been great for me.  I am 20 years old and about 2 1/2 months ago I started having some Panic attacks( thinking people were going to kill me, even my good friends, after going to a party with some pretty bad people (I got scared because one was carrying a big knife and he was drunk off of his ass, and I was high and on E (side note, never taking E again\ldots ever)) It was probably post traumatic stress. I also had a really hard time talking to girls, they would have to come to me before I could really date them etc.  I would also act kind of goofy because I would be nervous in some situations.



About 3 weeks ago I started taking Paxil, starting at 12.5 mg a day, and now up to 25 mg a day. I take it at noon.  When I first began taking it, on the second day, I would get waves of warmth going through my body, I guess that would be a side effect, but it was actually quite pleasant. The only side effect I currently have from 25 mg a day is delayed orgasm, which really isn't that bad, because I can still orgasm, it just takes more time (no fear of being a minuteman haha).



I am a lot more socially active now, I already have already successfully hooked up with three different girls in two weeks.  I no longer have anxiety attacks, and my high from marijuana is so much more relaxing and fun now.  Plus I just act a lot more cool, calm, and collected.



I loooove Paxil so far!  I'll probably stop taking it in about 2 months, because I believe that most of my problems were not totally related to the serotonin levels in my brain, but more like my childhood (only child, no mother figure), and Paxil is a good weapon for me to do some self therapy.  And the girl thing won't be a problem when I get more used to them.  Also, before I started taking Paxil, my panic attacks were already tapering off, and now that I am not in that crazy state of mind, I don't believe I could sink to that level again.
