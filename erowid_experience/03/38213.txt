I picked up some mandrake from the local witches supply store, so I'm assuming it's American Mandrake and not `old world' but that's just an assumption.  In any event, I asked her what she recommended to prepare it.  She said half oil and half root, shake a few times a day for 10 days. Dab some on forehead.  I ended up putting half root and half sunflower oil in jar shaken 3-5 times a day for 14 days.  I figured if it was stronger I would just use less.  



I find one drop on my third eye really gets it revved up.  Great for meditation or in silence or for artistic things.  I do plan on trying a few drops at a time but for now I really am content with just one drop.  It's more of a general postive vibe.  



It was through my mandrake use, I was able to experience my third eye and my crown chakra. Whether it was directly attributable to mandrake, or if was simply time, remains unanswerable.  But I do like mandrake and have a strong connection to it as it seems to be medicine for the brain; part of my personal spiritual education.



I've used it 2-4 times a week for about 5 weeks thus far. I'm still here and feeling better than ever.  Getting more creative by the day.  Because of the third eye work, this wonderful virtually unknown misunderstood gift is good for anything related to manifesting good spiritual energy; love, creativity, peace, harmony and general good vibes.
