Some time ago I came across 250 mg of DPT. With very little information to guide me, I decided to try this orally in a capsule. Earlier that day, I had eaten little, and before ingestion of the drug, I soaked in a hot tub to relax my mind and body.



It took about 45 minute to come on. I felt pretty good at first, with some colored closed eye visuals. Within 10 minutes, I was moving rapidly into uncomfortable territory. I was the first I knew to try this supposedly pure tryptamine, and thoughts came to mind that perhaps it wasn't what it should be. I had a sitter friend in the room with me, who had made a real cozy space for me to lie down, with appropriate music for the journey (thanks T!). I asked him to please open the window, as I really was needing some fresh air. It did help, and my mind eased a bit with him talking to me. I was in the bright light, similar to a 5-MeO-DMT meltdown. About all I could do was breathe into it. I did have some CEV's, and they were undefinable, angular, and somewhat colorful. They were not the smooth, liquidy type seen on mushrooms or DMT. I tossed a bit, and found it hard to clearly see my friend. I could make every thing out somewhat, but it was blurry. The most I could get out of my mouth was *fuuuck*. My thoughts were not clear, and I was astonished by the strength. My friend decided I might benefit from the grounding of some acupuncture. He stuck me with the needles at points on my hands and feet. I felt the electricity charge through my body each time. My friend said he had not seen a reaction so strong before. This did help, and I was able communicate a little. I asked for an apple, and that really grounded me. The taste was out of this world. A thoroughly sensual experience! I was now starting to open up for some theraputic discussion. My mind was free, and thoughts flowed easily. My visual field was a little better now. I was hungry again, so my sitter made some toast. Man, that was some good toast! Tactile sensations were increased as well. I can't say for sure if it would be a good sex drug. Perhaps if I had been with my partner, I could have found out.



As the effects started to wind down, I was in a very clear, centered space. A wonderful afterglow, and a nice reward for having gone through a very rough ride in the begining. All in all, it lasted maybe 4 hours.



Recently I have heard dreams of people using it I.M. at around the 100 mg dosage level. This is said to produce a very fine experience.
