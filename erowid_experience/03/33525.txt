(I had planned on keeping a journal for this trip so that I could give more detail here but I had no ability to write or even keep a train of thought  during this, so sorry for the absence of time in this report)



So my last report on this strange chemical was clouded with confusion as I had just written it moments after waking from a VERY deep sleep. For my second and probably last journey with this chemical I decided against mixing it with any other substance. I should start by stating that I do not own a digital scale that weighs down that accurately so I am only going by what I was told was in each gel cap. So if you are to try this the way I did (insulffation both times) start at a much smaller level and work your way up. Me and my friend (B) dosed at 8 pm. B took the two capsules orally and I snorted both. I began to feel the effects in about 20- -30 minutes. It all started with a vibration throughout my body, something I have never experienced with and other substance. This vibration began to grow and at the peak was my main focus. But I think I am getting ahead of myself. While the vibration started I went to my room to lay down. This was similar to a heavy dose of mushrooms to the effect that the substance `grounded' me. I had no desire to get up (or maybe I couldn't?) Either way I stayed in this position for about 1 an hour and a half or so listening to the pixies softly. 



During this and especially during the peak I could close my eyes and I would hear every electrical device's vibrations very distinctly and would become this vibration (when I say this I mean that while my eyes were closed I was not myself but just a single fast vibration of energy) this in itself put many thoughts into my mind about a vibration actually being another dimension that we can not grasp. I won't elaborate on my actual thoughts though because they were so hard to remember and when I say them out loud they just sound kind of like gibberish. So once the plateau hit me I was able to walk around my apartment and talk with my roommate and B who by this time was just feeling the onset (because it was taken orally according to Shulgin it should have taken an 1 and a 1/2 to 2 hours to come on. B told me that he was trying to read when all the words started to move. So I sat on the couch with him and we talked about nothing in particular. Through out the experience I would often turn to my girlfriend and tell her this was alot like mdma. 



Thinking back on it now  touch was similar but it produced no sense of empathy, well being, or self worth. The  whole experience also was rather sleepy, I could will falling in and out of consciousness with ease and experience lucid type dreaming. The come down for me started at about 6 in the morning when I looked at a very familiar tree and it was the only thing in my visual Field that wasn't morphing and twisting. This was pretty comforting and I felt that sleep was much needed. So I went to bed and slept a good 10 hours.  



Overall- I really enjoy this for the strange body high. The visuals were always growing and morphing (nothing was stable visually through out the trip) and if I could even begin to describe what I say it was close to a Persian rug. And again I got a strobe light effect of red color.



* just a note, through from other reports that I have read and friends that have taken this substance orally it  doesn't seem to work as well.  Although I am not suggesting this to anyone who is not experienced with tripping, because it came on VERY strong this way.
