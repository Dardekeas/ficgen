I have long been an avid reader of experience reports, but this is the first I've written. My history of drug use only contains alcohol, marijuana, and some timid recreational use of alprazolam. This is a report of my first experience with Kratom 15x extract, purchased from an online vendor.



t0:00. Last night I waited about two hours after eating a light supper to try this substance. I weighed out 1 gram of the Kratom powder and mixed it with a mug of decaffeinated tea, adding some honey for sweetness. I did not find the bitter taste overwhelming at all; if anything, I put in too much honey and the mixture was too sweet. I drank the tea in about five minutes, watching an episode of Carl Sagan's `Cosmos' to distract me. The bottom of the drink was chunky and grainy---not that fun to try to get down, but I managed. I'd say the texture of Kratom is its downfall, not the taste.



t0:30. I was slightly nervous about this experiment, but I felt like I had done sufficient research and was starting with a very low dose. I continued watching Cosmos and didn't notice anything other than some very mild relaxation (placebo effect?). 



t1:00. One hour in, I start feeling the effects more strongly. I feel very relaxed and content. A few waves of very light euphoria come over me. I jot down some introspective musings in my notebook, as well as some facts learned from Dr. Sagan.



t1:30. I decide that the 1 gram isn't doing too much for me, so I get out some more Kratom. I didn't measure this time, but I'd guess it was about .5g-.75g. Instead of trying to drink the powder, I simply mixed it with a small amount of applesauce. Brilliant. Tasted fine and went down easy. I put on some chill sitar music and lie down in simple contemplation, waiting for the additional effects.



I lost track of time at this point, as I was completely lost in the music and my own thoughts. I wasn't really feeling euphoria or a `high,' like when using marijuana. I did feel very `stoned' though, and I guess I would refer to my state as being high because of my total relaxation and contentment. I kept sitting up to write things in my notebook, such as `The question 'how are you?' has infinite meanings, and therefore, infinite answers' and `Can a mind be fully 'open?' Or are there only degrees of closed-ness? Or---is it the other way around?' At the time, these thoughts were totally mind-blowing. In terms of introspection, this plant is infinitely better than marijuana. 



At this point I couldn't keep my eyes open, but my mind was fully awake. I felt as though I was in a hypnagogic state, but without the uncomfortable sensation of drifting in and out of sleep. Dreamlike thoughts and images crossed through my mind, but I was fully aware that I was having these thoughts. I wonder if this is close to what lucid dreaming feels like.



I do end up falling asleep for about an hour or hour and a half. Up until this point, I felt absolutely no nausea. Sitting up now, I did feel a bit queasy. Not really a `drunk' kind of nausea; just a bit uncomfortable. I get ready for bed, and about ten minutes later I'm feeling fine again. 



It was the oddest night of sleep I think I've ever had. I woke up every two hours or so, but I was able to immediately fall back asleep. At times I was confused about my surroundings. I was very hot at one point and threw off my comforter. Also, I was very dry-mouthed and took a few sips of water every time I awoke. My dreams were bizarre and wonderful. They seemed very realistic, and each time I woke up I would have a new set of dreams to ponder over. Unfortunately, none of them were that meaningful; they were all pleasant, though.



Now, the next morning, I am feeling great. I am mentally and physically energized, even though I probably didn't get as much sleep as I would get normally. I need to study for a test today, but I'm oddly looking forward to doing that. I feel as though it is a privilege to be able to fill my mind with knowledge. I'm also going to a symphony concert later, which I am thrilled about. I feel like I will be thinking about the music in a whole new way.



Overall, this first experience with Kratom was wonderful. I was able to still function normally for the most part, and yet I felt totally connected with others and the universe. I was completely relaxed and comfortable (something rare for me, as I suffer from anxiety). Next time, I will try 2 grams right away, mixing it in applesauce. And I mustn't forget to keep that notebook by my side.
