I went to the dentist to get a filling replaced.  I have a big needle phobia, so I asked the dentist if nitrous was a possibility (I also was interested in the nitrous experience itself).  He put the mask over my face and told me that I'd smell a slight chemical fragrance but that it was nothing to worry about.



I started to feel very dreamy, like I was floating somewhere near the ceiling.  The dentist told me that I would start to feel very warm and content, that it's just like floating in a raft down a river on a warm summer day.  `It's just like being\ldots ` and then he didn't say anything else.  I wanted to say, `Stoned, doc?' but I couldn't make my lips move.



I didn't care.  I was so calm and in a very dreamlike state.  I didn't notice the dentist giving me the novocain at all, I was so euphoric.  I could feel the pressure of him removing and replacing my filling but I couldn't really FEEL it.  At this point I was lucid enough to think to myself, `God, I wish I could be like this forever,' and then realized that I'd just asked the powers that be if I could please stay in the dentist's chair having my teeth drilled for all eternity.



The thought of this was so ludicrous that I began to laugh softly to myself.  Or so I thought-- apparently the friend who had driven me to the dentist could hear me giggling maniacally all the way in the waiting room.



When it was all over, the hygienist gave me straight oxygen, which brought me down quickly and gently.  I was still very euphoric and light when I left the office, though that effect wore off quickly.
