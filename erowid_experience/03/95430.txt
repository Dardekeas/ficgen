10:33- I took two pills at 9:30, and one more 15 minutes later. Already experiencing motor skills worsening, everything is slow. So slow



10:35- vision is swaying. Watching a movie, cant remember what movie. Slightly more responsive, typing seems hard, but I'm able to think more clearly like 5 minutes ago.



10:38- realize that I ate before taking the pills, wish I didn't, everything would be better. I want a narrator to narrate my life like in this movie. Would be dope. No tingling in fingers, head is fuzzy. Holy christ 50 cent is in this movie.



10:42- everything is swaying I see two of some things. I want to be at a party right now, but I cant. I want to talk to someone. I miss my childhood. Typing is still hard. But I'm a champ. Everything is numb. Nothing makes sense. Skype. Movie. Powerbot. Too many thinks at once. Skype just closed. Wondering why.



1052- thinking of taking another mg. Not sure if its good for me seeing I've been doing ethylphenidate all day. Fuck it. Grabbing water. Got my water, stumbled and shit on my way there. Wondering if its a good idea to take another. I'll wait 15 minutes and see how I am then.



10:55- this narrator is talking about some deep shit. Note to self, watch the movie tomorrow if you don't have plans. I think people are coming over tomorrow so maybe try to watch it after you wake up or something.



11:01- water is depleted I don't remember drinking it. Time is going slowely minutes feel like 5 minutes. I want to talk to people that I have lost contact with.  Pupils are extremely dialated. Dont know if its the etizolam or wat. About to take another. Wish me luck. Water is depleted again. Pausing movie. Getting water, popping pill. Is what I'm going to do.



11:12- +1mg etizolam. This shit will be hitting hard. Cant walk barely move. Turning off lights times moves slower and slower. Fourth pill should be kicking in soon. Going to post this and edit it as I go. Strangely energetic. Weird as these are sleeping pills in small doses. I don't understanfg the movie, but its entertaining.



11:39- I can barely walk. Colors are brighter. More vibrant



11:58-everything is so real. I keep having times when I feel like I'm drunk and times I'm completely fine. Wtf? Movie finished. I can honestly say I don't remember any of it.



Conclusion: it's 4:05. I still can't walk straight, but everything else seems fine. The walking may be the purple bomb I took, but I can't be sure. Etizolam was a lot of fun. Next time I do it (in a more social environment) I feel like it will be a lot better. The purple bomb + etizolam made me extrememly euphoric.



Music was greatly enhanced. I tried watching a movie, but I never really was able to focus on it.
