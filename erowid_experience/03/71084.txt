I did some research on dxm prior to trying it, but did not consider possible drug interactions. Hence, I took yohimbe and St. John's wort in my usual daily amounts in the afternoon. Around 8:30 P.M. I took the dxm. Setting is my apartment; I am alone.



t+1 hour- I start to feel a slight buzz.



t+1.5 hours- Intensity increases; as it does so my face begins to itch. Itch spreads to chest and back; I look in the mirror and see a bright crimson rash on most of my upper body. I feel slightly feverish. I have diarrhea, and shit four times in the next hour. My heartbeat is somewhat erratic.



t+2 hours- I feel very manic; I am filled with energy. This is not what I expected at all; the experience resembles more than anything else my few cocaine experiences. It would even be pleasant if it weren't for the diarrhea and rash.



t+2.5-3 hours- The diarrhea stops, thank God. The rash also subsides, though I have an occasional itch for hours to come. Sadly, the manic euphoria dies down as well. I am left with a feeling of peace and contentment. I don't feel high anymore, exactly, I just feel good. Happy and relaxed.



Conclusion: This was not what I expected at all. I felt nothing remotely psychedelic or even dissociative. Probably this was a result of unforeseen drug interaction. Overall, despite some unfortunate and even frightening symptoms early in the experience, I enjoyed myself. I will probably experiment further with dxm, but in the future I will use more care.
