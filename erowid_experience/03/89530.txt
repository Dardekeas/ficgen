A few days ago I had a really intense RC experience that I think changed my outlook on the whole scene now.



I recently found a great RC website that had quite a product line of exotic RC's. I made a large purchase, and received the goodies few days later.



I had taken 2C-E and 4-HO-MET before, but something went wrong this night.



I started off with taking 15mg of 4-HO-MET and 20mg of 2C-E, weighed out, and parachuted. After 50 minutes, I took 115mg of 6-apb, which was a a light tan color. After 1.5 hours of taking the first dose of anything, I started to feel the familiar waves of the phen/trypt combo. I was watching Family Guy and having a blast.



At the the 2 hour point, I didn't feel like I was rolling much with the initial dose of 6-apb, so I took another 85mg of it, parachuted, with some juice.



At the 2.5 hr mark, something felt very wrong. I looked over at my buddy, and told him `Something isn't right'. At this point, the bad trip began for the rest of the night. Somewhere in the mix I did something wrong, and I started to feel really shitty. Increased heartbeat, bad paranoia and anxiety. The visuals I had were very sadistic, sinister type visuals, can't really explain it any other way. My right arm was going numb, and I had to constantly rub it and try not to lay down and give in. This horrible feeling lasted for 2 hours. It was a bad trip gone horribly wrong, and the idea of dying was constantly being circulated in my head.



After the crazyness, I procured some Lunesta to comedown, and started to gain control. After this point (4 hrs total later) I was in a cracky mood where I was all over the web, on multiple websites, tweakin out, listening to music, just trying to chill.



This night completely scarred me and I don't think I well ever do a combo night ever again without proper research.
