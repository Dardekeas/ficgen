Having Taken LSD numerous times, shrooms 2 times, and DXM Hundreds of times (usu. 2nd -3rd plateau trips), I figured I was ready to try 2C-E. I tried to keep an audio log, but after about six hours, my voice was badly slurred and I forgot how to work my recorder.



8:00 pm. +0 mins. 2C-E ingested, 15mg. in a green capsule with rabbits on it



+1 hr. Body began to tense, hands naturally formed fists, jaw clenching and teeth scraping. No visuals.



+2 hr. No visuals, body still tense



+3 hr. I took 3 hits of some mid grade bud with some of my friends. Visuals beginning to develop. No change in conscience, but some creative thinking.



+3 hr, 15mins. I stood in front of the mirror, watching the shadows casted on my face begin to take up color and morph. My face took on a tribal look, as if I was wearing facepaint. I examined the bathroom in my dorm, and I noticed how all of the shadows in the room grew larger the longer I looked at them. Looked back at the mirror and noticed my left pupil was 2 times larger than my right



+3hr, 25 mins. Peak beginning I went into my friends room laughing my ass off. As I went into the room, I looked at J's face. The shadows cast on his face looked like a super hero eye mask and as he talked, I could feel and smell his voice, I felt each consonate tingle my ears  and his voice smelled like roasted nuts. After sitting down, I noticed how hard I was clenching my fists. There were nailmarks in my palms and as I looked at the marks that I made they began to spread and take on a violet tone. I began to freak out so I headed back to my room.



+3hr, 45min.  I came back to my room and started to listen to an IDM mix that I created before I had taken the 2C-E. At first the music was very nice, but it began to sound like an overload of noise and I began to panic. In my state of panic, I saw the shadow of a person (ghost like) walking toward me and I began to smell rotten fish. Knowing what was happening, I told myself that it was only the drug and that it was not real. Coming to this realization, The smell faded and the shadow disappeared. If I had not had previous experiences with other hallucinogens, I probably would have not been able to do this.



+4hr. I began to get very thirsty, so I went to the sink and filled up my water bottle. I looked outside the window to check if the nightlady was walking around, fearing that she would come in the dorm and find me tripping. This state of panic caused me to see the shadow person again. It was walking on the path outside leading to my dorm, and as it got closer, it shrunk, until it was outside the window looking back at me as I watched it, I smelled burning rubber. I ran back to my friend J's room and told him what was happening. He made me lay on his bed and told me that everything was going to be okay. After about 10 mins (not sure) the panic was gone and I watched the ceiling again. The ceiling broke up into two layers again, repeating what I saw before and in my peripheral vision, I saw a variety of colors forming an indistinct pattern. I watched the colors morph and shift, still creating no distinguishable pattern, for a couple of minutes until I went to the bathroom.



+4hr, 30 mins. As I was relieving myself, I watched the shadow casted by the toilet. I watched it grow and begin to take on a purple hue as it grew. As I flushed, the color spread out all over the stall and stuck to the stall walls. The Purple created a pattern similar to a tribal tattoo. It created 30 or so patterns that eventually shrank away. 



+4 hr. 50 I made it back to my room put my headphones in and turned out the lights. I layed down in my bed and closed my eyes. As I lied there, The thoughts in my head formed scenes for me to watch as I thought them, but as I tried to focus on the scene, it disappeared.



+5 hr. Music once again became too intense for me so I had to turn it off. My body was still tense and I was still peaking. Rolled over after putting my ipod on the floor went back to thinking. I cant remember any thought I had, as they kept shifting before I could pay attention to what was going on. 



+6 hr. I could no longer speak very well and I found it very hard to work my digital recorder. I couldn't see which button I was pressing, so I gave up and went to sleep (around 2 am.)



+12-24 hrs. I had mild visuals for the next day and I would become very disoriented for a couple of seconds when I moved my eyes too fast. No other side effects.



4:00 pm Next day. snorted 15 mg. 2C-E. it felt as if I had been stung in my nose and the pain lasted for about 10 minutes. I barely had any visuals, body was tense. Should not be taken twice in a couple of days. Tolerance?
