Boredom struck me, and i found a pill of generic 0.25mg halcion.  Usually benzodiazepines have little effect on me (i have to insufflate a whole 4mg xanax bar or take at least 3 10mg valiums to do much), so i decided to inject it to get the most out of it\ldots i was already a little tired and worn out from a day of driving, and I just wanted to relax\ldots 

So, I prepped the needle and dissolved the crushed up contents of the pill into a spoon with water\ldots heated it to remove impurities, and substituted part of a cigarette filter for a cotton ball\ldots I then proceeded to tie off my arm and located a nice vein\ldots in went the needle\ldots 

 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:IV\_TABLET\_INJECTION\#\# 

Upon removing said needle, I felt a strange rush, but a comforting rush, nowhere near as intense as heroin or cocaine, but it was nice.  Soon, my desired effect came about--a sense of relaxation and well-being--along with slight loss of motor skills and motivation.  Right now, I just want to sit and listen to music.  Or if I had some pot, I would smoke it. Twice the dose would have been nicer\ldots but i don't exactly have that opportunity.

Surprisingly though, the effects are noticeable and welcome (I injected a 2mg ativan once with little effect)\ldots so either Halcion is a lot better, or I'm just weird.  Well, i'm either off to sleep or off to take a shot of hard liquor (not recommended\ldots only professionals should attempt such a stunt)\ldots wow\ldots i feel\ldots so\ldots chill\ldots
