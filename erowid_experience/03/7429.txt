One would hope that readers are familiar with the cautionary requirements of dicking around with ones \href{http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois}{MOAI's} in combination with centrally active compounds.



I've had my share of scare's\ldots  pumping veins and all. Personally I havn't found very many aplications for the betacarbolines that I continue to use aside from the traditional oral tryptamine (dmt, 5meo, dpt) huasca activation.  The one harmala combination that I have yet to try and would like too is mescaline. This combo makes sense, since a large amount of mescaline is usually required and it has been fairly widely reported as being a positive potentiation.  Combinations with mdma and other stimulating compounds seem quite ludicrous to me.



The obscure rue combinations known to me are: 



with shrums: defintitely intense on the body at high dosage levels, qualitatively different trip.



with 2cb: heard several negative reports, too much physical activation/headache



with mescaline: many positives, a few neggies



with LSD: several positive reports.  provides a more earthy grounded feeling.



with DPT: works well huasca style, be very careful with the dosage. Comments from a friend: `Instead of 100-200 mg oral only 30-80 are needed.

Also the oral DPT bodyload was greatly reduced.'



with 5meODMT: increases effects, some report worrisome physical symptoms



with Psilocybin: Many people report positive work with this, but can increase darkside and increase length, intensity, bodyload
