This herb combination was always the best to me. Better than the herbal X that was all the rage at the time, which we all know was overpriced crap for fools. For the same price a good yohimbe extract was a better and more economical. All other reports ive read on yohimbe experiences seemed like its a disappointment. used in proper dosage and in absence of unfriendly drugs ( like DHEA, speed, cocaine,alcohol, stimulants in general)its incredible.



For a year or two in 1994-96 I regularly used yohimbe extract in the morning, along with a joint or two. I usually took 2-4 dropper fulls either in cokacola or in OO gelcaps. the extract was a 5x ethanol extract. in about twenty minutes id get the most elated feeling ive ever gotten next to mdma, but only with cannabis. I'd also smoke a joint or two. My daily trip to work consisted of a goodly walk, then hour bus ride to work. Id be very high, but alertness which I dont usually have with pot. The sun would shine, birds would sing, the world was a beautiful place. During this period I was usually very down. This was one of the most pleasant drug combinations Ive ever had. Overdosing to enhance the effects is seriously dangerous. One time I was down to the bottom of a bottle of the gaia brand and couldnt get the stuff in the dropper, so I poured it into a shot glass. I thought it was only 3-5 dropperfulls, onle 1/5th an inch in the shotglass. I added soda, swallowed and almost vomited, that itself shouldve been a clue that I took too much. I started my normal route to work, and it was a miserable day. Rainy, though I usually love them, and cold. By the time I reached my transfer, I was vomiting. I shook all the way to my job, where I hid in the dumpster area puking again.This was the only bad experience Ive ever had. After about three hours I didnt feel like death. Respect the herbs of the earth, and they will respect you. Dont abuse drugs.
