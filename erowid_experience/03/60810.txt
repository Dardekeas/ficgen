Around 12:40AM, I was puttering about my kitchen, and, after reading about Nitrous, decided to inhale the air out of two whipped cream canisters.  I sucked in as much as I could from the first canister and held my breath as long as possible.  I breathed out and immediately felt giddy.  My mind was fairly clear, I could easily think.  My body felt sort of drunk, I was stumbling, and I found this very amusing.  Talking to a friend online, typing was very difficult because my fingers kept hitting the wrong keys.



I breathed in some more Nitrous from the other can, and this is when the strongest effects started.  My body and lips instantly felt tingly and numb.  I was once again stumbling.  I felt completely Euphoric and laughed at everything.  Everything my friend said I thought was hilarious.  When he said things that normally would make me concerned, I was able to respond normally and express concern, but in reality I was laughing uncontrollably.  Hence the name, Laughing Gas.



The numbness went away within a couple minutes, much sooner than I wanted it to.  Unfortunately I was out of Nitrous.  I can see the addictive potential of the drug, the high is short and very nice and I definitley want more soon after.  I felt euphoric and giddy for about twenty minutes after, and then I felt a sort of hangover.  My head felt very heavy and it was hard to hold it up.  I felt very slow and typing was difficult.  I no longer felt euphoric, but I didn't feel bad, the hangover was actually a bit enjoyable.



As I type this the next morning, I have a light headache, but no other problems. I'm glad I tried Nitrous and I'll do it again, but with caution to avoid addiction.
