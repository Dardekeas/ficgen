My bottle of 4-aco-DET is almost gone. All the stuff is on the walls of the bottle and stuck to the bottom. It looks yellow. So I said fuck it. I used water to wash it out and I dumped it in orange juice. And as I am about to do what I just typed above I will be back when I am tripping. Lets see what happens.



Back and tripping. I came to the conclusion that when looking at a concrete floor the fractal like patterning is amazing.  I do not want to type at all right now. But I am forcing myself to, it's almost as if the more I type the more I am going to vomit. It just makes me want to gag. I'd rather be just looking at that floor. But I will not because I made a goal to type this report. 



I see lots of colors all over the screen but more red and green. I think everyone on the planet should try this stuff, now I do not say that because of the feeling one gets, but rather the sheer mind expansion. Now I'm seeing more fractals then I can comprehend. Shit I see fractals shooting across the screen and my room. I came across this thought. Endless fractals turning and moving inside out and outside in within one another in a perfect figure and I'm like, what the fuck how is my head making this shit happen. Times that by 10 and you will still not comprehend how amazing the fractals are. I mean it's like the most complex mathematics working in a visual mode that Einstein would suffer to understand. 



I don't understand how my body can let me here the music but it does. And above all the stuff going on in my head I could see all these fractals. No need to think or understand no need to try to act normal or think Normal I believe I am working at my brains full potential and I come up with this conclusion because the fractals. The fractals are the key. There is no way being so fucked up can be so clear.  The concrete floor is good because it has many natural and un natural imperfections. Lots of nicks and cracks that make the fractals more crazy. It is as if the fractals are a pattern that I saw when I was a kid. And its so clear that I was on the floor looking closer and closer till I was inches away from it to make sure it was just my head and not the floor. It was so real. As I go closer I found that the fractals were the same crazy patters but in a smaller line of view, what this means is it's not what I am seeing on the floor but what my brain is making up inside my head. 



Fractals are part of the mind working is a strange way. This RC is by far the king for fractals. I can control the fractals and make them move to the music. I am amazed as to what the brain can come up with. At the start of the trip I really thought I took to much and I was at the end of my life I thought I really did it this time and I went over the edge. Clean, pure, clear and true. A perfect mathematical bliss of color, shape and understanding.
