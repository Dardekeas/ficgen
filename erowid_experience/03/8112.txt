Over the years, I have heard more negative opinions and bad news about speed than virtually any other drug. Even one of my closest friends, in passing, has mentioned his dislike of speed's effects and people who abuse it. He's quite a wise man and almost twice my age, so I really did take his word for it that it's bad news.



But I am rather experimental with psychoactive drugs and the first easy opportunity to try speed was easily accepted. I got a call from this guy I work with (he's a sleazy sales guy, I'm an engineer) and I jokingly said, `let's get together and do some lines man\ldots ` (We have a very informal relationship and I meant it as a joke.) To my surprise he said that he is picking up an 8-ball of coke tomorrow. I didn't even know he did coke and I never told him I did either. Half of me thought he was bullshitting about it anyway. I said cool, hook me up and he said alright. I had tried cocaine a couple times a few years ago, but never got into it. However, over the last month or so I have been dabbling into it\ldots  I'm about done with coke; it's nothing special in my opinion. Anyway\ldots 



So I stopped into the office to meet up with him yesterday when he told me that he had a miscommunication with his supplier and instead of coke, he had bought an 8-ball of speed. He asked me if I still wanted some and said he wanted to get rid of as much as possible since he didn't want all that speed and couldn't sell it back. I noticed his disappointed attitude about it and that further strengthened my awareness of the fact that this is not only a dangerous drug, but one with potentially unpleasant side affects. I was mentally preparing myself to try it. I told him I had never done speed before and asked what it was like. He told me it's great if you want to stay up for a very long time\ldots  Stay focused and fight fatigue. Although that didn't exactly get me excited, my interest was surely peeked. After lunch, we cruised to his place and agreed on what seemed to be about 0.75 g which was placed in a baggy.



I tried a couple larger bumps from his stash and hung out till the initial rush subsided and eased into a more relaxed and mellow feeling. That took about 5 minutes for me. I did feel sped up, but it was not a feeling of twitchiness or nervousness at all. Before I left, he instructed me to drink water while I'm on it to help move it through my kidneys. He told me that I should feel the effects of those bumps for about 6 hours. He warned me that it is much more potent than coke, so go light on the lines. If you are considering trying an amphetamine, you better get hip to their potency, toxicity, and ability to cause severe damage if abused. This knowledge helps me know when enough is enough and keeps me honest about what I may be doing to myself.



The car ride to my afternoon appointment was fine, I was not a danger on the road to anyone or myself. I am naturally a very alert driver, so I felt quite natural at that point. I design and implement complex computer networks for businesses, and today's appointment would potentially be an all nighter. What a perfect time to try speed I thought. Of course as soon as I got there, I did a medium sized line to get more of a feeling for it. I must have snorted about a 1/2 gram of the stuff over a period of 24 hours, about 4 or 5 hours between blasts. Yes, I worked 24 hours straight. It's not that big of a deal, I have worked a couple 20+ hour stints before\ldots  with absolutely no chemical assistance besides some coke (the soft drink!).



All in all, it was a rather interesting night. My mental skills did stick with me longer than the other three guys'. I was thankful for that because I was the lead engineer. Even though we got hit by a couple major setbacks that really sucked, I felt more eager than usual to solve or work around them. The speed had worked just the way I had hoped it would. I was probably a little over expressive a couple times, but I certainly did not act like a `tweaker.' I monitored my pulse now and then and it was slightly elevated to about 80 beats/min at times. I am quite exhausted now and I'll need time to rest. Just as I was told, I can tell you that it is going to be hard to fall asleep. I haven't even tried to yet and I've been up for about 36 hours at this point, the last 24 being `sped up.' 



Don't take my experience as typical, and remember that the potency and purity of any illegal drug is usually difficult to judge without sampling it. It's important to have a guide with first hand knowledge of a drug that's new to you. It's even better if an experienced user samples it in order to start you off with an appropriate dose. Be smart and be safe!
