It was near Christmas and my choral group was putting on a concert for some local women's club.



Afterward's a friend of mine asked me if I wanted some OC's.  I said sure.  He sold me the Oxy for 15 dollars and threw in a free 10mg morphine tablet.



He told me to take them both at the same time, he said the feeling was amazing, almost orgasmic.



I drove home and at 5pm I took the morphine and snorted the oxycontin.  About 15 minutes later I felt the usual opiate/narcotic laid back feeling.  I am pretty experienced with opiates and narcotics having taken everything from Codeine to percocet to lortab to demerol.  I also smoke top quality marijuana everyday.  30 minutes have passed and I am having trouble walking and concentrating.



I want to sleep but I know it will be a waste of good pharmaceuticals.



I get something to eat and try to read a book.  This doesnt work so I just sit on my bed enjoying the body tingle and `sinking through the bed' feeling.



1 hour and 30 minutes have now passed and I can barely keep my eyes open.  Finally I pass out.



I have some great dreams while out but they are hard to remember.  Opiates give me great dreams. Sam Taylor Coleridge wrote most of his poetry under the influence of opitates.



When I finally wake up several hours later I still have the laid back feeling, but nothing too great.



Overall I would say it was pretty boring and way too heavy of a dose to enjoy.  All I wanted to do was sleep.
