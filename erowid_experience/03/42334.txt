Let me start off by saying, I take a lot of prescription medicines, and that's probably why I react the way I do when I smoke marijuana. My first bad experience with pot started as soon as I built up the meds I had started taking in my brain. The medicines I take took a couple weeks to start working, in other words. But once they started working, marijuana became a total nightmare. 



First bad trip: I was at my friend's fiance's mother's house, a totally foreign place to me, I had never been there. It smelled bad. It was freezing outside. It was Christmas. Terrible. I watched as my friend rolled up the first joint. He taught me how to do it. Anyway, he was the first to go. He took two hits, passed it to me. I took two hits, passed it to my friend's fiance. She passed it back to my friend. So on, so on. 



At first, I was really enjoying myself. When I'd take a hit, I'd stand up and stretch as far as I could while dragging out a single hit from what was left of the joint. I'd wonder why they were laughing at me. So I joined in with the laughing. I noticed as I was watching TV, it seemed that everything I saw was green. And on top of that, the TV looked like it was a hundred yards away. This didn't shock me in the least. I thought it was hilarious how friggin screwed up I was. 



We started playing some card game. I never learned the name of it, but I can tell you, I know exactly how to play it. But when it came my turn to go, I was so confused as to how to play, I just sat back and pretended like I had already gone. I knew my friend and his fiance were too high to know the difference. They went on without a single question, and when it came my turn again, I admitted I had no idea how to play. They laughed. We quit playing, and put in Mars Attacks. We yawned and expressed our thoughts on how stupid it was. Normally, I love that movie. Which is weird, I guess.



Eventually, I noticed I had this horrendous ache in my left ribcage. And when I thought about it, I realized that I felt something like blood trailing down my ribcage. My initial thought was I had been stabbed. I ran to the bathroom and looked at myself. Nothing. I came back and told them that I had a terrible pain. It felt like a waterfall of blood pouring from my heart onto the skin, from the inside. And the blood continued to pour down my side. My friend got worried, and asked if we needed to go to the hospital. I said no, and that it was silly. And that I'm just real high. 



Soon enough, we rolled a second joint. As high as I was, I didn't think twice about smoking another. So. I smoked another. By now the pain in my side was so severe, I couldn't take my hand away from the spot, and I couldn't stop making a terrible face, and I couldn't help but eventually make a noise of discomfort. My friend asked, `So you're really in pain?' I said, `Yes.' And he said, `Follow me.' My current state was so rattled and screwed up, I immediately started worrying for my life. I wondered if my friend was going to show me what `real pain' was, and break my arm or something. I followed him into a room, and he said, `Shut the door.' I shut it, reluctantly. I watched his every move, ready to dart out of the room at any sign of danger. I could feel sweat started to form. I looked down at the floor and saw some weights. They were weapons in my mind, at the time. 



My friend walked up to the window and shut the blinds. I immediately gave up and decided to face him. I asked, `Are you going to hurt me?' Terrified out of my mind. Pain in my side worse than ever. Sweat. Cold. Alone with this psychopathic killer. Too scared to move. My friend said, `What?' I asked again, backing up, `Are you going to hurt me?' In my mind, no matter what he said or did, I'd never believe anything other than what I was thinking then. That he was going to hurt me. To this day, I'm not even sure if he was going to hurt me or not. He ended up talking me down a little, but I kept my guard for the rest of the night. And ended up deciding to sleep through the rest of the high. 



Every time I smoked since then was a bad trip, but I feel like this one is of more importance considering it was my first and it happened to happen as soon as my meds kicked in. Since my last bad experience with pot, I decided to call it quits until I get off my meds. If that ever happens. And to offer a second possibility as to why all my highs have been bad, my friend I was with always scared me a little. And being with him while high could be why I freaked out. I've been with him every time since. So, maybe the medicine thing was just a coincidence :)
