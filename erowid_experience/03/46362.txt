 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 

I was drinking after work and someone told me about these things so I went and picked one (there was a few plants right in the middle of town). While at the bar I was eating the seeds. It was about 11pm.

Then I wake up in a hospital. 3:30 a.m

As ashamed of myself as I am, I will tell you what others told me I did. Driving a car into the other lane and grazing someone else's car. Then leaving the scene of the accident and driving into the woods. My car got stuck and then I walk away from it. I guess the car I hit called the cops and so did the owner of the land I was on. An ambulance took me to the hospital. I guess I was really hallucinating and smoking fake joints. Then in the hospital with an IV in my arm. kept sitting up and wanted to get a drink but the cops wouldn't let me (they were actually there) and everyone was asking me what I ate and I just told them I was drunk and didn't know what was going on. Then at about 830 in the morning (I was at the hospital for 6 hrs) they said I could go. But thinking about it now I don't know why they let me go. 

I waited outside for my dad to pick me up and I was talking to people who weren't there, and hearing voices. I could also make anything I wanted to disappear. I had gotten three tickets for that night, and I couldn't even read them, I also couldn't read a newspaper and right now, 24 hrs later, it is still hard and my pupils are still dilated.

I cant even begin to describe my hate for my actions: almost killing some people. I would have woken in jail not know what I did, but killing someone, goddamnit. Right now I cant  even live with myself. I consider myself to be very lucky and I am truly happy no one got hurt last night.
