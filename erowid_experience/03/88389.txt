I have been smoking spice for over a year now regularly. I usually get Big Bang as so far I have noticed the strongest high and the best taste from the mango kind. 



Now after having used these products everyday, multiple bowls a day I have yet to have ANY overbearing reactions or `bad trips'. It does tend to give me a light headache, and sometime I catch myself grinding my jaw, definitely not recommended if you wear contacts, the reaction and dryness will cause severe watering and sometimes a light pain in the eyes. My wife and brother have both told me about separate occasions where smoking spice has caused adverse effects including my wife's inability to recognize the world round her, a severe change in her voice, and an inability to focus until I threw her in a cold shower. My brother complained of nausea, dizziness and a strong feeling of `wrongness'. I personally have noticed an addictive quality to spice, as I have no addictions to anything else I can at times feel myself `fiending' from spice, my wife as well. I would say spice like any drug should be tried carefully and with some hesitance.



[Reported Dose: 	6-7 bowls a day constantly]
