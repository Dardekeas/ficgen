Me and my best friend `H' were going to an EDM festival and wanted to roll or trip. My mind set was good because I was excited for the concert and I've been doing a lot of meditation and yoga, except many changes are about to occur which I've been stressing out about. H and I had just been ripped off when we tried buying tabs; so in a moment of desperation we bought pills that were sold as E from a last-minute source. Which was mistake number one.



When receiving the green transformer cut-outs (6 in total), I automatically got a bad feeling because cut-outs usually aren't to be trusted. Then I did some research on them and found out that a lot of them were piperazines. I've never tried them before and when I looked up the effects it sounded close to MDMA. (I've done MDMA, E, speed, and smoke weed often) So I decided that it was better than nothing and to take the pills anyway. Mistake number two.



11:30 a.m. - Me and H each take half a pill and go to the first set.



12:30 p.m. - Slight wave of euphoria, only lasting 5-10 minutes, then gone.



1:00 p.m. - Take second half of pill.



2:30 p.m. - Feelings of coming up or on the verge of coming up but only lasting 5-10 minutes again. I start getting stomach cramps, back cramps, muscle soreness, and become very tired of dancing, very quickly.



3:00 p.m. - We get lunch, just thinking that we haven't digested the pills completely yet and that we'll begin to roll after we eat.



3:30 p.m. - Start getting a nice body-high going, smoke a cig (amazing), and then after 10-20 minutes or so, the buzz is gone. We both get pissed off and take another half of a pill.



4:30 p.m. - In the crowd again and I am utterly exhausted, annoyed, and hate life. It's hard to enjoy the music because I feel so drained. We have both taken 2 pills at this point but still nothing.



5:30 p.m. - Still feeling very sober, H and I take the third pill and chew it. Disgusting, chemical taste that refused to leave my mouth no matter how much water I downed.



6:30 p.m. - At this point, we are so tired, hot, and de-hydrated we can't even stay in the crowd to watch one of our favorite DJ's perform.



7:00 p.m. - We eat some ice cream and there is another intense body-high. We are both cracking up and saying, `oh shit' because we thought all of the pills were about to kick in. To our surprise it was just another tease and we are `sober' again.



8:00 p.m. - We get some energy after eating a couple slices of watermelon and dance for an hour or two. We decide to leave the festival early because we are so worn out.



We kept saying that they were `beat pills' but now I know (finally) we were pipe-bombed. The come-down is terrible. Insomnia, heart-burn, irregular heartbeat, soreness, and nausea. Seems like a case of some BZP's and TFMPP's from the other experiences I've read. 



I would recommend avoiding it if you can. It's not smooth at all and feels completely unnatural, plus the comedown just isn't worth it.
