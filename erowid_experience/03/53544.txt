It all started on a wednesday. My friend asked me if I had ever tried morphine. I said `No, do you have some'. He replied `Yeah do you want the 15mg pills or the 60mg pills'. Me, wanting to get an effect chose the big pills so he gave me 2 60 mg pills in a bag and let me try a 15mg pill at his house. We went into the jacuzzi in his apartment when all the sudden I got really weak and had no muscle strength and I couldnt feel my back.



Later knowing that 15mg had an effect on me I thought that 60mg might be a bit too much for me. I broke on of the pills into pieces and tried a few methods of ingestion. I tried the insufflate method first(snorting). I broke up a little piece and snorted it through a hollowed out pen. All it really did was make me dizzy and it didnt give me this intense pleasure I had heard about.



I then tried to make some tea out of it by disoving it in water. This gave me fuckin indegestion and I had some bad pain starting at the top of my stomach and working its way down. It happened because morphine upsets my stomach and I ate after it. I induced vomiting so I could get all that food out of my stomach because the pain wasn't worth a little buzz because I didn't eat much morphine. The next morning I tried smoking the stuff. I put like 15 mg into the bowl and smoked it and it just made my pupils small and gave me a little diziness.



I got really pissed off at having no effect after all of this and decided to just eat a 60mg pill. I ate it at about 3:00 and all it gave me was indigestion again and no effects. A few hours later I went to the gas station and picked up a energy drink completely forgetting I had taken the morphine earlier. I drank it quickly and went to my friends house to watch the suns game. About 20 minutes later I started to feel high and remembered I had taken morphine. I asked him if my pupils were small and he said they were. I started to get little waves of pleasure when I ran and walked so went upstairs and started playing gta:sa. I didn't feel so good and had to go home.



When I got home my parents expected me to eat dinner but I couldn't because every bite made me feel more sick. I went to the bathroom and threw up all the hot cheetos I had eaten. I didn't feel quite so sick anymore and ate my dinner. I told my mom thatit was the caffein which made me sick which it partly was. I got another wave of the sick feeling and decided to stay home and lay down because I had heard that that can help with the vomiting. I layed in my bed and I couldn't feel my legs or arms but I had a strange pleasure. At this point I couldn't even stand up without getting sick and throwing up. I think I passed out or just fell asleep on accident listening to my ipod (which was the best part of taking the morphine)and woke up 2 hours later having to go to the bathroom.



This is when I first realized I had urinary retention(inability to piss). This bothered me very much because I had drank alot of water and I couldn't piss. It didn't bother me so much then because I couldn't feel my bladder much anyways. After trying hard to piss all I acomplished was to make myself sick and I started throwing up violently like scary movie 2 into the toilet.



It was 10:00 pm when I first realized I couldn't piss and it wasnt until 12 hours later that I finally managed to go. It got to the point where I was considering waking my mom up and risking her knowing that I took morphine from the signs and symptoms(she is a nurse) because I had to pee so bad. I even had fucked up dreams where I would finally be able to piss and then wake up having to go really bad without being able to.



All and all I don't think that indigestion, urinary retention, and extreme nausia are worth a little bit of pleasure and good sleep.
