 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:ACETAMINOPHEN\#\# 



I am a seventeen year old drug addict and I think anyone reading this should know that before they continue in my past. I have done several drugs of which hydrocodine(vic from now on) which is most pertinat.



It started as a nice night, I went with a good girl friend of mine to a carnival which was in town that weekend. We got a little stoned (smoked reefer) and watched the fireworks. All and all a very nice evening until I looked at my watch and noticed I was very late and I was due home over an hour ago, and to add to it my father was calling me every five minutes since to remind me how late I was and how much more pissed off he was. To add to his fire I was finishing a ciggarette as he walked out to my car when I pulled in. He hated it when I smoked.



Well he was unbelievably pissed as I mentioned and this was the last straw. He gave up screaming and hit me a couple of times. He regretted it as did I believe me. I was so astonished I didn't fight back. I did nothing except after he went to bed I found his vic. I was emotionally destressed at the time so I took a hand full of the huge pills and forced them down. The I took another hand full and forced those down. I turned my T.V. on much too loud and passed out a short time later.



My parents tried frantically to wake me up the next morning with out results, but I did open my eyes. It was almost impossible to keep them open. Then I threw up and couldn't move away from the barf. Nothing even registered in my mind at the time. Shortly thereafter I passed out once again. I slowly stayed up for more time in periods it wasn't till 5 days later I was able to spend a whole day awake and alert. It was horrible, I almost died and it was all around stupid.
