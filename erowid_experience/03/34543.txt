I was digging through the fridge late one night recently, and came across a little manilla envelope. Inside of it was a gram of kana leaves. I think I got it as a little gift from a supplier when I last ordered mimosa hostilis root bark. I had never had this herb before, and was curious as to what the effects would be, especially in contrast to what I had read online. Some of the stuff I read looked a lot like typical vendor hype. I figured I may as well evaluate this one for the good of all mankind. Oh yeah, and lots of good it'll do, I'm sure. Heh.



Anyway, me and my gf rolled up a joint, about half a gram of the stuff, and proceed to give it the get go. The taste was mild, and the smoke was pretty easy on the lungs. After smoking about 3/4 of it, we put it down and decided to just hang out for a bit and see if anything came up. We were not experiencing any effects at this time.



Then, about two minutes later, the effects came on. It was like the clean feeling I get whenever I roll, and a little bit of a positive push, like weed has. No particularly strong mental effects, lots of grinning. Bit of a head in the clouds without a care kind of feeling. Pretty nice. but not stoning in the least. Clear headed, and the whole ordeal had what I'd call a `moderate' effect. A lot like how I would imagine diet weed would effect a person. If, of course, they marketed such a thing. The effects tapered off to a pleasant afterglow within I'd say 45 minutes. Also, we were both hankering for chinese, and our appetites were both totally gone by the time we finished smoking. A pleasant effect.



All in all, it isn't too shabby. I wouldn't mind having a little around just to brighten my days here and there, without the lasting lazy stone of weed. And the taste was nice as well.
