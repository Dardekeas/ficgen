Recently, I ingested 30 milligrams of 2-ce, orally.  



First and foremost, the public is generally not very much educated about `research chemicals'.  The purpose of this experience report is to inform YOU, about my experience for educational purposes.  



In my experience, 2-ce is all about `set and setting' as Tim Leary put it.  In other words, the chemicals effect was influenced by my current state of mind, and the vibes of the group I was hanging out with. My friends girlfriend came into town for the weekend, whom I met for the first time while I was tripping.  I felt UNEASY as I tried to make an impression that I was a somewhat NORMAL person and I was just under the influence which is why I was acting so strange.  



I felt as though when I tried to express my thoughts as words, the order of my words were mixed up. For example, `how do you? said meant do did I?  Did I just say that?! Not like this I\ldots , No! NEVERMIND!!!' 



Socially I felt awkward and uncomfortable as I tried to talk to this woman. Visually, I was astounded.  I could see, touch and feel the energy each person was radiating in the room, and each person seemed to have a different tint to their energy.  All of the `waves' seemed to end up to a specific place on the ceiling.  It was like a glowing light of life on the ceiling.  All the energy of the room was flowing into this one specific spot.  My words do not do this beauty justice.  So I will stop.



In Conclusion, I believe 2-ce is a great tool when I am around people I  know and trust.  In the right settings, I suggest the use of 2-ce as a tool to enjoy life, bond, find some sort of `truth', and think.



Thank you for reading.



Peace and happy tripping.
