About two weeks ago, I was rolling hardcore at a party near my school.  I started the night off with a white tweetie which hit me in about 25 minutes.  About 45 minutes after ingesting, I had the opportunity to buy a Buddha, and I did.  Anyway, I was rolling ballz while I was sitting on a mattress next to one of my boyz.  Another friend of mine brought over a balloon with 3 cartriges of nitrous inside.  



After I inhaled it, I basically died.  My vision kicked out even though my eyes were wide open.  I couldn't, or better said, didn't want to move at all.  I couldn't hear anything either.  Then, the blackness turned into a deep, dark, purple.  Outlines of people and objects began to appear in front of me, but the outlines, against the purple, were bright white lines of light that were pulsating intensly in towards me.  For about 30 seconds, all I saw were white flashes outlining objects.  My friend began to call my name to check if I was alright.  For some reason I couldn't seem to respond, and for a long period of time, I thought that I was dead and that I was drifting away, able to hear my friends calling to me, but not able to respond and let them know I was alright.  Slowly, colors began fading in, and so did sounds.  It was definitely ridiculously awesome.
