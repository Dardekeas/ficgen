It started on a Wed. night after work.  Now I have been using drugs of almost all forms for about 7 years.  I've done 5 day crystal binges before so I knew what to expect when my freind showed up with a whack of ice.  You see I live in a small town presently so it's tough to find good ice.



Meth is everywhere in the larger cities that I lived in.  But in this town I havn't, (until this wed) got any good stuff.  So I bought a few caps\ldots . and snorted about half of one.  It burned like hell, just like the good stuff.  Within minutes I could feel the meth racing through my viens. My leg starting bouncing and I rollarcoaster began.



I snorted that first load at around 2300\ldots  I snorted the rest of the first cap between 0200-0300\ldots  I was also smoking weed all day\ldots  I smoke all the time so it's hard to conieve it as drug use.. but\ldots  non-the-less\ldots . around 5 or so in the morning I wanted to chill out a bit so I muched 2 quaaludes\ldots . 



After a bit I was feeling the drunkeness of the barbituates and stil racing strong on the meth\ldots  it was quite interested to be so out of control of ones motor skills and yet have the energy to run a marathon.. crazy\ldots 



I did not sleep that night at all\ldots  just partied all night\ldots  drank a bit as well but not too much.. I don't like to drink while on any barbituate especially\ldots   I started to snort some more meth at about noon thursday\ldots  to keep it up ya know\ldots  snorted anohter cap and a half over the course of the day and evening\ldots  



Stayed up all night again\ldots  snorted some more\ldots   you get the idea.. now my body was starting to feel quite poisoned and quite useless\ldots  but\ldots  anything I'm doing; i'm gonna do it right\ldots . ha..



So\ldots  now it's friday\ldots  I bought some junk.. Morhpine pills actually\ldots  crushed up one and stuck in which a bowl of weed\ldots  superb\ldots  I've smoked lotsa opium in my day and that's what it most resembles\ldots  even tastes alot like it\ldots  yummy\ldots  so then I freebased some meth\ldots  more bumps\ldots  you get the idea\ldots  I was quite out of it\ldots  



A superb expeience on all fronts\ldots  now It is saturday\ldots  still havn't slept\ldots  and am planning on buying more meth to conitunue my little binge\ldots  and I worked every night this week. and still am.. .i work tonight\ldots  and am still snortin cyrystal\ldots . good stuff\ldots 



I don't think I'll repeat this again soon.. because my body is rebelling\ldots  but\ldots  I didn't die\ldots  so\ldots  Definitely fun\ldots .
