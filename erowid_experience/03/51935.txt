I first heard about the Anadenanthera Colubrina seeds through an anthropology documentary. Watching Shamen using the snuff, I thought to myself this is something I have to try (already being a tobacco snuff user).



I purchased a 25g bag of seeds from an online vendor, and anticipated their arrival greatly, when they came I followed the traditional method of making the yopo snuff, the seeds were dry fried until they popped like popcorn, they were then deshelled and pounded to a fine powder in my mortar and pestle, I mixed in at a three to one ratio some sodium bicarbonate. and mixed and pounded the matter again into an even finer snuff powder.



I left this mixture in an small air tight container for around two weeks, until I felt ready to experience its effects.



The time came when one evening I decided to work with this substance. I opened out two medium lines on a piece of A4 paper and snorted both lines into each nostril, and then woosh! O what a pain, only just bearable.



I placed myself on my bed with my heart thumping very hard and a huge adrenaline rush running through my system. I was listening to some wonderful ambient music through headphones which really helped i think.



I closed my eyes and opened them again, and my entire room seemed very linear and grey, and the walls were slowly and steadily breathing.



Then I closed my eyes again and I felt as though I was being strangely spun around backwards and forwards.



I then had a few various CEVs of a Python of some sort which seemed to jump out at me, and as it did i opened my eyes yet again, and was greeted by a still picture of the face of Che Guevara floating across my room.



This was the high point of my visions, and i afterward came down to a very pleasent high.



The entire journey lasted no longer than 30 to 40 minutes.And the next morning I felt wonderfully refreshed and very happy.



This was an experience I was very pleased to have, and something that will stay with me for long time.
