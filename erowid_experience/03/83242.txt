* * * * *



NOTE: This is a LIVE trip report! It gets kinda weird and cosmic the more you read but it's all truth :).



 Put on some Shpongle. Already noticing more depth and layers in the music. I'm perspiring, yet calm. Field of vision seems to be tilting a few degrees to the left, perhaps I'm noticing the tilt in the floor more than I normally would have. No crazy visuals yet.



 Still no visuals, but everything I look at, touch and hear is just more\ldots  Interesting. Textures have more depth, music has more layers, everything is much brighter.



 Overwhelming feeling of total bliss, similar to a very strong hash high but also completely individual in its own rite. I'm DEFINITELY feeling some changes within my being/soul/self/idontknow this is fucking awesome oh man



 okay gonna try going out to the backyard now, gotta see what nature is like



 before going outside I looked in the mirror. I wanted to drop to my knees and cry, I realized just how beautiful a person I am inside. It's me! I'm here! I'm a human being!



 just got back from outside. Didn't realize the brick walkway was so uneven and warped. Everything was so beautiful, this is such a beautiful day. I saw a squirrel and then he ran away over the fence. Had to go back inside because my girlfriend was getting cold. Typing is much more difficult now. I'm such a n00b, I still have that tab under my tongue but I don't know if I should get rid of it yet or what. `Joe' still isn't answering his phone.



 okay, I feel like an even bigger n00b now, just called the guy I got this acid from, apparently visuals won't start happening for another few hours or so. What the fuck do I know. Oh well, I'm ready for it when it happens. Also apparently I could've swallowed the tab ten minutes in, not over an hour in. *gulp* done.



 started laughing hysterically out in the garage, loud and happy and love oh I am laughing for the sake of laughing because it feels good oh does it ever feel good



 we humans invented time. We created time. It is our brainchild. They say we need time but time needs us, without us and the constant attention we pour into this creation of ours it would cease to exist. We are the structure, the pillars, the support, the architect. We are. It's so clear. The human mind and all its creations. We are god.



 I feel the overwhelming urge to sob and cry in utter joy and happiness. I'll be criticized for this inside the house. I must go to the garage. Hahahhahahhhhahhahhahha



 haha I keep distracting myself from what I was gonna do before, but I'm gonna do it after I type this. Just wanted to report that I hugged my girlfriend and it was wonderful, but even more wonderful were the feelings leading up to the hug. She asked me, `can you give me a hug?' I said yes, yes I can, and it's wonderful, I can hug, I can touch, I can love. Oh yes. Okay crying time now, I'll report again when I come back from the garage. Hope I don't wander outside absent-mindedly past the boundaries of the property in which I reside, but what is this property, what is this other than a comfort zone we construct for ourselves, an idea that having a roof over ones head symbolizes stability, goodness, the ridiculousness of it all is becoming comical and lovely. :) oh god it's 5:39pm now, maybe I don't need to cry, I'll go find out now.



 wow, didn't think that much time passed. Haha time. Didn't end up crying, but I sobbed a little bit, mostly internally. The tears didn't flow but I felt them, they were great. I think I've still a few more social filters to break through before I can truly bawl my eyes out on a level I so deeply desire but with every passing minute it feels easier and closer.



 I called `Joe' when I was in the garage and chatted with him for a while. He's really happy to hear about my experience. He's on his way over right now, I'll be waiting for him in the backyard in about an hour and fifteen minutes. He's bringing pot! But even better, `Joe' is coming yay yay yay I love `Joe'! If it weren't for his gentle and wise advice I definitely wouldn't feel brave enough to do what I'm doing today.



 time for more shpongle time time time



 at first I thought I was overanalyzing but no, I know what this feels like, I feel like my soul is stuck in a perpetual state of peak orgasm, coexisting with the aftercuddle that follows mind-blowing sex



 one of my biggest worries going into this trip is that what I'd feel would be beyond words and impossible to convey but this file sure is putting that worry to rest quickly. Look at how much I've recorded! The words come to me with such ease, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa



 I just felt like typing something



 I am trembling with joy and amazement and wonder and awe



 I can't believe it's been a whole minute. Okay I'll take a break from this file for a bit, I just need to feel



 enough listening to music, I'm going to make some. Sort of. Time for some frets on fire!



 okay `Joe' should be here any time soon, more than a feeling by Boston never felt so alive, life never felt so alive



 I think `Joe' should be here any minute, though I said that earlier because I didn't understand what time it was or how long it had been. Here I was talking about time -- which we invented and created -- and now it's just slipping away from me\ldots 



 you know, when I first took this hit, I was expecting to see all sorts of weird, pretty visuals. I don't think I've got a single visual yet, but it doesn't matter anymore. That's not what it's about, that's not what it's about! I just feel it within me and it flows through me and it wakes me up, it's so wonderful, it's so wonderful!



 even within the first hour I realized why the powers-that-be don't want us to open up our minds with this wonderful, beautiful substance, but aside from that, this is something that could replace the world economy. It would replace the dollar, the euro, the pound, everything. People would give it, people would share it. It would break down barriers of what's `ours' and what's `theirs', what's `mine' and what's `yours'. LSD could bring about the singularity.



 I can feel a part of myself resisting. Resisting what it's trying to tell me. It's like I want to know it, but there's a certain element of fear there that thinks it's protecting me. Maybe when I take a full hit it'll be too much for my defenses to handle. Then I'll know. Then I'll know what it's trying to tell me. Right now it's eating away at me like crazy. Damn it\ldots 



 I gotta keep reminding myself that I'm probably only half way into this, if even that! This is such a unique experience, especially how when I first dosed, I was questioning whether or not anything was really happening, but now\ldots  Well now just fucking listen to me, hahahaha! I just can't stop logging all everything I'm feeling! It's such a wonderful feeling, I have to type it all up, I have to share it, I don't know what else to do!! I hope `Joe' gets here soon! I'm gonna give him a great big hug as soon as he gets here and thank him for helping me feel brave enough to try LSD.



 I just discovered how malleable and shapeable this whole experience can be! I can almost instantly go from being all mentally hyperactive and spun to being totally mellow and calm. I've never felt this much freedom within my own mind!



 I'm smoking my first bowl of pot through the trip thanks to `Joe' arriving here and getting me high. More to come.



 I barely feel spun anymore, I think the pot mellowed it out. It's still there, though, waiting to come back to the foreground.



 okay yeah, the acid's coming back for sure now. Wheeeeeee!



 I don't know if enya was singing about lsd when she wrote `china roses', but damn if it didn't send ripples through my soul and remind me of my feelings through this very experience, which is still going pretty fucking strong. Clearly, I need to listen to more enya.



 after a good, long cuddle with my girlfriend and doing a lot of energy play and exploration with her (keep in mind she's 100\% sober and has never done psychedelics in her life, she's just really fucking good with energy to begin with) I think I may be ready for sleep soon. I'm still a little spun, but my mind feels like my body after many hours spent longboarding. Aching, burning, but totally satisfied and fulfilled. It's a good exhaustion that comes from something fun and wholesome.



 okay, now I know what they mean by `you're done with LSD before it's done with you'. As I lay in bed trying to get some rest, I couldn't get my head to stop racing around until about now. Ten hours\ldots  Holy shit. Going to sleep now. Good night!



* * * * *



The Morning After



Everything seems a little brighter and warmer today. I feel I've gained a new perspective on life. I feel like I'll be looking at the world through completely different eyes from now on. I feel reborn. LSD has changed me for the better. I'll never be the same again.
