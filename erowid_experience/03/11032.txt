This is a neutral report on the usage of Ambien and its effects.  I was prescribed 5 mg of Ambien as a sleep aid during a hectic and stressful time at work.  I took the 5 mg pills a few minutes before bed time and I would fall asleep in less than 20 minutes and awake the next moprning refreshed.  One weekend I took a pill and tried to stay awake, I did and I was rewarded with a calm, slightly euphoric light-headedness.  I challanged myself to see if I could handle more so I took 4 more pills 45 minutes after the first.  I passed out 10 minutes after the second dose.  



I got out of bed an hour later and was `sleep walking'  I have never done this before.  My girlfriend tried to talk to me but she insists I was an uncontrollable zombie walking around for an hour or so before I fell onto the couch and passed out again.  I have no memory of any of this, the last thing I remember is taking the second dose.



No harm came to me because I was relatively safe in my house with my girlfriend.  The zombie catatonic state could be trouble if someone was around untrustworthy people of if driving was involved.
