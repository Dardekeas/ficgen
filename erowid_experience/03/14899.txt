This was my first experience with this material and the intensity of it was quite surprising.

Materials

approx 8mg 5Meo-dipt

cannabis smoked occasionally



Report

The previous night I had tried 2CB for the first time. Me and my friend X were in a good mood and decided to try some 5meo-dipt of which I had a small quantity. At this point I hadn't slept but was surprisingly awake and a quick shower fully refreshed me. 



I carefully measured out 8mg 5meo-dipt by dissolving a quantity into vodka and using a 2cc capacity syringe to measure out the required dose. I chose 8mg as I worked out the possible error from measuring to be +/- 0.5mg but I had heard of the weight of chemicals purchased from suppliers being quite a bit over weight so I erred on the side of caution. 10mg would be the maximum dose I could've measured out and from reading reports that seemed pretty manageable.



At 12:30 X and I downed our `shot' of vodka. Yuck! This stuff tasted absolutely disgusting. The taste lingered in my mouth for ages and I drank a fair amount of water to try and get rid of it. X didn't manage his entire shot in one go, leaving about 1/5 of it in the bottle. We sat back and put on `Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas' (again!). 



2 minutes after dosing I turned to my friend and we agreed we were feeling first effects. This was rapid. Within 10 minutes I was starting to get heavy breathing and I could feel my stomach knotting up. I was getting MDMA style body rushes which would travel up my entire body. They felt cold as opposed to the warmth of a MDMA or 2CB rush.



After 20 minutes I was already heavily fucked. I felt quite nauseous and the rushes were intensifying. This is strong. I begin to wonder how much stronger it could get. Did I take too much. I run through the process in my head again. I convince myself I've accidentally taken a double dose then realise all the maths is right and I needn't worry. My friend sat with his eyes wide open with a look of amazement on his face. `Fucking hell ' was all he could manage to say before blowing his face up and breathing heavily.



At 40 minutes it was getting crazy. I was rushing so heavily I couldn't actually function properly. I kept opening and closing my eyes. I curl up on the bed and grab at pillows, scrunching them up with quite a bit of force, trying to ride out the rush. I could feel every bit of my body tingling. I looked at a poster on the wall and the colours started changing slightly. Out of the window I could see yellow spots on everything. All this time I was trying to hold onto my stomach which really did feel rough. A friend came into the room and all I could do was roll round the bed and giggle before saying `this is soooo strong'.



At 1hr my friend decided we need music. He disappeared off to get another friend's cd player. I lay down on the bed and felt an incredible burning sensation in my arm. I look down and see it's just the pillow has been in the sun and is warm. This stuff increases my sensitivity to stimulation incredibly, way more than E or 2CB.



At 1hr 10 my friend reappears having completely forgotten what he was doing. We put on a tape instead. He just stands in the room looking like he's about to pass out or something. I'm starting to get control of myself again. Music sounds amazing. I don't notice any distortion in sound like people have mentioned getting off this material before. 



At 1hr 20 I felt like I've reached the peak. I could speak and walk around. Me and X discussed what just hit us. It was like walking into a brick wall - a complete shock to us. I felt really happy and wide awake. I looked in the mirror and I was flushed pink across the tops of my cheeks and my nose. The skin there felt incredibly smooth; in fact just touching my clothes felt good. Walking round was a bit much as my feet had gone incredibly sensitive.



At 2hrs we were still on the plateau. We managed to make our way outside and to the park. X had consumed the remainder of his dose and walked along the street giggling. We decided we must look like the public's idea of a depraved dope fiend. The sun was shining and it felt wonderful, like sun when stoned but far more intense. I wished I'd brought sunglasses as it was all far too bright. Colours were much brighter than normal. Once we'd sat down on the grass I felt calm. I could look across the park and pick out individual things. Each blade of grass was glinting in a different way. Brushing my hands over the grass was very strange but not entirely unpleasant.



We sat in the park for about 4 hrs. We smoked quite a few spliffs which chilled me out even more. They didn't give me any visuals like I was hoping for. I seemed to be at the same level for this 4hrs. Nothing changed and I was wondering whether it would ever end. We played a bit of rugby once some other friends came down but I found this to be far too much effort and kept dropping the ball. Obviously my coordination had been affected somewhat.



About 6hrs after taking the 5meo-dipt I could feel it start to drain out of me. We went and sat in a bar but I couldn't stomach a drink. It had been a long session with 2cb followed by this and no sleep in between. I started to get tired really quickly but I wasn't feeling paranoid or irritable. After 8hrs I decided to call it a day and headed up to my room. After a quick shower I felt refreshed and fell asleep almost immediately. 



I woke up feeling pretty fine. I was tired to the same degree as when I do e but I hadn't eaten or slept for 2 days and this was to be expected. I didn't feel mentally tired, just physically.



****************************



The comeup on this was the most intense experience I've had apart from salvia. I really did think I was going to lose it and it was bordering between amazing and scary. The nausea wasn't too bad and our stomachs were already in a pretty bad state after our 2cb adventure the night before. Vodka + 5meo-dipt on a rough stomach would probably cause anyone nausea. I didn't experience any problems with diarrhoea and apart from my stomach I didn't find the body load too bad.



Once up the experience was actually pretty mild. I was fucked but still able to function, talk to people and walk around without looking weird.



Next time I get the chance to try this I'm going to do a smaller dose. The comeup was a little too harsh and I would like to explore to find a dose that would be pleasant recreationally, rather than a 2hr hell ride followed by 4hrs of calm.
