8:30PM---Took 2.5g of piracetam, a nootropic and vasodilator.



8:45PM---Ran on the trail that snakes around the local lake for 20 minutes to open up my circulation system and start off with a ``runner's high''.



9PM---Parachuted $\sim$300mg of mephedrone on a single sheet of toilet paper. I minimized the paper by peeling apart the two layers and placing the mephedrone on a single layer and drank a full glass of Brita filtered water. I wondered if the charcoal particles found in the water leftover from the filter would diminish the drug's effects, but rationalized that it is probably negligible if anything at all. Afterward, I hopped in the shower to wash off the sweat and grime accumulated throughout the day and the intense run.



9:27PM---A bodyload is felt, particularly in my groin area; it's actually arousing me a little. The bodyload is comparable to 4-MeO-DIPT.



9:30PM---Worried about the numerous posts about excessive vasoconstriction, I am drinking a single beer containing $\sim$32ml of ethanol alcohol. In smaller quantities, it acts as a vasodilator which explains reports of it increasing pleasure when combined. The negative reports associated with the combination of alcohol and mephedrone may be due to excessive alcohol use or preexisting dehydration; alcohol in large quantities acts as a vasoconstrictor; consequently, this could amplify the vasoconstrictive effects of mephedrone.



9:45PM---WOW, I stood up and it hit me, a general feeling of euphoria, it does not ``roll'' like MDMA. At this dosage, it is similar to MDMA, but not a facsimile. Pupils are dilated. I feel happy, really happy about everything. My eyes are darting and I am suppressing an urge to grind my teeth. The primary difference between MDMA and mephedrone is the stimulated euphoria associated with MDMA is definitely not occurring with mephedrone. Other than that, it is difficult to distinguish them, but I presume if I were to use both substances within a short duration of time I could provide a better contrast if I recovered to a state of equilibrium quickly after using the first substance.



10PM---Feel even better than before, I should be peaking. Movement is a little wobbly, but definitely can dance and thoroughly enjoy music. Enjoying some online conversation and thoughts and articulation are unimpaired and fluid. This is deyhydrating, so please take due care in hydrating yourself. My heart rate is also elevated, but nowhere near alarming.



10:07PM---Articulating your feelings is easy, I feel like an emotional book open for inquiry. Dehydration is intense, drinking lots of water with added electrolytes.



10:25PM---Continuing to peak, no increased or decreased level of euphoria from previous annotation.



10:48PM---Still peaking, and really opening up to a few of my online friends. I urinated again, this time it was like a race horse on amps, which probably attributes to the prominent dehydration which I am trying to satisfy unsuccessfully with lemon water. 



11:06PM---Feeling good though it is beginning to decrease in intensity. Not rolling like MDMA in and out of feelings of total sobriety and highness, it is a slowly tapering decrease in intensity. I completely enjoy this comedown more than MDMA, so far. Heartbeat is the same pace as before, but nothing concerning. Mouth is parched and sipping on lemon water still does not alleviate this longer than a few seconds. 



11:15PM---Enjoying my closer emotional association with music. I am listening to a pandora.com station that plays electronic and popular music (non rap or country).



11:33PM---Experienced a downward roll in and out of an instance of complete sobriety, felt like an MDMA comedown. Thankfully it was brief.



11:45PM---Euphoria transformed from the most noticeable feeling to a lingering, fading feeling -- in the background. Overall, I still feel good, but sympathize with people who redose to maintain or recharge the high. 



12:00AM-Fatigue and the desire to sleep begin to set in.  On another note, the sexual application mephedrone yields may be limited, I was and continue to be limp; I experience the same effect with MDMA. No sexy, sexy time while on mephedrone, however, tactility pleasure increased which may heighten the pleasure of kissing and/or groping.



12:15AM---I feel normal with exception to slight, vertigo disorientation and delayed cognitive processing. Still dehydrated, though I must account for the 10mg Adderall XR I took around 12PM and alcohol on top of the mephedrone. It is not in any way threatening, more so an annoyance. Also, if I took mephedrone alone, the dehydration dilemma may not exist.



12:26AM---Going to bed. l will provide an overall assessment once I account for my emotional state the day after.



8:37AM---Mind is cloudy and limbs feel a tad heavier. Also, for clarity, the dehydration I incurred last night was not a total body symptom comparable to a hangover, but more akin to cottonmouth, as I am experiencing now. During the high and when I woke up, my appetite was suppressed. My legs and knees are achy, my feet, elbows and knees are cool to the touch, so this substance exhibits vasoconstrictive properties which could cause major problems if not accounted for with countermeasures to offset them. Also, these symptoms occurred after I ate and drank plenty of water to rule out lack of caloric intake or dehydration. The euphoria was terrific, but not worth jeopardizing my health with long-term use, or partaking in a multi-dose session. With numerous reports reflecting permanent damage over a single dose, it is hard to ignore the evident risks involved. It was fun, and I may use the remaining amount, but will not order more.  If you decide to use it, take care in accommodating its vasoconstrictive properties.



3:00PM Fatigued, I took a nap for 2 hours. During the nap I woke up twice, once for my leg falling asleep and again for my arm falling asleep; generally, my limbs do not fall asleep this easily and I was not positioned any differently than normal. My head is less cloudy, and overall, I feel normal now. My legs, feet, knees and elbows are warm to the touch and no longer ache. The amount of time for the vasoconstriction to wear off far exceeds the duration of the high unfortunately, and it should be accounted for when wanting to do a multiple-dose session.
