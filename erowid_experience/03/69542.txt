A really good friend of mine recently took about 30mg of 5-MeO-AMT. It hit him within 15 minutes and while he was in a public place he caused a scene and had to be restrained by the police.



t + 1h: They took him to the cells. He was foaming at the mouth, unable to be communicated with and was throwing himself against the walls. 



t + 14: he lost consciousness and had to be taken into the intensive care unit and put on life support. 



t + 24: he was placed into a regular ward with possible kindey damage due to enzymes from his muscles clogging everything up.



t + 3d: he is still in the hospital, kidneys have gotten worse and we can't yet rule out brain damage at this point.



All he can remember is sitting in the car and the next thing he was in the hospital with a respirator.



Please take this as a warning\ldots DO NOT TRY THIS DRUG! There are way better drugs out there which are far more safer. Give 5-MeO-AMT a miss.
