I was upstairs alone in my dope lair experimenting.  I had some Rohypnols which I had heard a great deal about ('the date rape drug') and decided I would try one for myself.  For some reason I chewed it instead of simply swallowing it.



Moments later my wife called me down to dinner - my folks, sister and brother-in-law were there as well along with my children and my nieces and nephews.  I walked into the dining room and took my seat at the head of the table (it was, afterall, my house).  Everybody started laughing\ldots   The blue ink they put in the rohypnols was all over my lips and teeth.  Try to explain that one!



Since then I have tried it a number of times and I haven't really found it to be very different from any of the other benz'.  I find Xanax to be stronger, more able to whip anxiety and much more powerful for inducing sleep.  I find Valium more pleasant for a general `taking the edge off of the day' sort of feeling.  I used to love Klonopins and found them to be the most euphoric of the benz' but I suppose after several years of occasional use of them I have built up a tolerance and they do little for me (except cause short-term memory loss).  The Rohypnols are nice but they don't stand out from the crowd as far as I am concerned.
