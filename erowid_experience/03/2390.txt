\underline{10:15PM}

A friend of mine gave me a 0.5mg tablet of Xanax (alprazolam) tonight, which I crushed up and put into a gelcap (for faster absorbtion than a solid pill would probably provide). I just gulped it down. It's been a few years since I've had Xanax.



\underline{10:25PM}

I think that crushing the pill did indeed make a difference. I'm already beginning to feel some effect. Makes sense\ldots  a powder is much easier to digest and absorb than a solid tablet.



\underline{10:45PM}

I'm feeling the effects now. They're rather mild, but nice. Similar to a low dose of GHB, but not nearly as euphoric. Just a calm, relaxed, sedate - yet clear-headed feeling. 0.5mg is a rather small dose, being the average adult anxiolytic dose, so of course I won't be feeling incredibly high. But this feels good. I know that I will sleep incredibly well tonight! Perhaps some cannabis to enhance the effects\ldots 



\underline{11:15PM}

Well, it seems that Xanax takes about an hour to fully kick in. I figured what I felt at the 30 minute point was it - it didnt seem to be increasing any - but in the last 5 minutes the effects have intensified alot. I'm sure the fact that I smoked some cannabis with a few flakes of hash over it at 11 probably didn't hurt\ldots  Its much like GHB or (of course) other benzodiazepines. Its a little less euphoric than Valium, but I seem to have more physical effects. Much more feeling of muscle relaxation.



\underline{12:10AM}

I feel at about the same place, maybe a hair stronger of a high. Its very much like Valium. I'd have a hard time telling them apart. It seems a little more clear headed and less euphoric, but not by much - and this is probably dosage related. I feel very relaxed and peaceful, listening to music is nice, I feel no urge to do much but sit and relax. Walking, I notice my coordination is a little impaired. I'm a little tired but not sleepy. The addition of cannabis to the mix is nice. I wouldn't go out of my way to look for this substance, but I'd certainly do it again if it crossed my path.



\underline{1:50AM}

I don't feel a significant drop in effects. Maybe a slight one. Listening to music, and just relaxing. Nice.



\underline{2:30AM}

The effects have noticably decreased, though they are still definately there. I'm beginning to feel the call of sleep. I think its safe to say this report can be wrapped up by saying that I'm going to go and get a nice, long nights sleep.
