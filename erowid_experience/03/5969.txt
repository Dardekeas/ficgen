I would like to report my experiences of morning glory seeds. The first time i ever did morning glory was at my grandparents house, i went out and bought 2 packs of heavenly blue morning glory seeds and then i crushed them up with a hammer and ate them. I didnt feel any effect till about 1 1/2 to 2 hours later, and the effects were pretty pleasant. 



The only thing that i didnt find pleasant about my experience was this peculiar pain in the back of my legs. The pain didnt go away through the whole experience and it only hurt when i walked. It was pretty irritating. 



The other time i did morning glory i took 3 packs of the seeds at my house at about 10:00 or so. The experience was MUCH stronger, almost double that of my previous experience. This time i also had pain in the back of my legs though, and like the experience, the pain was twice as strong. It was to the point where i didnt even get up to walk cause i couldnt bear the pain. I thought the experience would wear off before i had to go to school the next morning but when i awoke i found that i still had the pain in my legs and ..well..i was fucked because i had to walk out to my bus stop while tripping.  I tripped..probally till\ldots 10:00 that morning. It was very noticeable while i was trippin, you cant hide it like pot cause your pupils get fuckin huge, they're like quarters inside your eyes\ldots freaky shit. 



But i just wanted to add this experience cause i didn't see any other experiences listed on Erowid mentioning the side effects of pain in your legs after doing it. On the other hand\ldots i would recommend this drug cause it is hella fun and compared to other shit seems a lot safer.
