I first encountered GHB while buying weed from a man that based his operation out of an abandoned screen printing shop. He had set up a lab to synthesize the wonder-drug from microcircuitry-grade GBL and lye. Instead of buying the 1/8th I intended to buy, I bought a half cup for \$15. I downed three teaspoons immediately and walked back to a local cafe. Once there I felt the promised euphoria. Everything was slow yet exciting. I became very fond of the chemical and a very open user of it. I carried a bottle of it with me at all times. I would often spike drinks out in the open. At that place, nobody really cared. I found myself drawn to the opposite sex in the most profound way. I cuddled with friends and occasionally had sex with some of them while under the influence of good ol' Gamma.



After about three months of spinning more and more down the tube I got a job as a software engineer in a town about two hours away from my old hangout. I had a quart delivered to me for \$150 but shortly thereafter, my dealer got busted. I don't know for sure, but I think he had enough chemicals to synthesize a fishtank full of GHB when the cops found him. He ended up getting off the hook due to a witty lawyer but they took all of his equipment. Now I have less than three doses left and they'll be gone soon; effectively ending my GHB days. I've had some good experiences and some bad ones. It's made as happy as could be on some occasions and extremely suicidal on others.



I found it to be a social drug and I don't like to do it alone.  Doing GHB without someone else around (preferably someone of the opposite sex) is dangerous. It makes me feel very lonely and petty. When I do it in a crowd and I feel great and benefit from the wonderful possibilities the drug offers. (Warning: It's easy to overdose on GHB. I always know what the concentration is and how much is a good dose for my bodyweight. It took me quite a long time to develop a good sense of how much is the proper dose for a particular person. Most GHB tastes disgusting due to the byproduct of NaCl (salt) produced in the reaction. GHB should be chemically neutral however, not changing yellow litmus paper).
