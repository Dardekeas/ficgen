I would like to start this off by stating the fact that explaining a Gasoline trip is exrememly hard. A gasoline trip is basically a true trip to another dimension, passing through this dimension seems to bring on some nausea and head aches.



I had taken 3mg Ativan about an hour before this experience, So I was feeling their effects.



I exhale all of the air out of my lungs, and inhale the fumes from the Gas can. Hit 1. I take a few good breaths of fresh air and take another hit. Hit 2. I catch my breath and everything is blurry and buzzing. All of this is so intense I decide to take another hit. I inhale the hit, hold it for as long as I can, exhale completely, then take a fourth hit without taking a breath of fresh air.



I then began to lift off, there are no other words to describe what happened I just lost EVERYTHING, I don't know where I am or who I am. I'm just sitting there and all of the sudden my vision fails and I seem to be trapped in an orange/white swirled sphere with no body. I come to the conclusion that this is normal, this is reality, and I just sit there and eventually the sphere seems to shatter and I'm with my original surroundings once again buzzing around me. It took me a while to remember what I had been doing (huffing gas) and exactly where I was.



Overview: Huffing gasoline can put me into a COMPLETELY different reality for a short amount of time but it could feel like an eternity. Everything is gone, I wont know who I am, where I am, what I'm doing, and I wont care. In my opinion the effects of inhaling gas are EXTREMELY fun :P.
