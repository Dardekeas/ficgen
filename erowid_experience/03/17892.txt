I was bored one night and I was not able to sleep so I surfed the internet to find ways nutmeg could be taken. My main concern was getting past the taste. I was up until 6am. I then went back to sleep for a few hours. I looked around the house to see what I had to work with. A few tea recipes looked good. So adapted those with my creativity. First I took my 1 cup coffee maker and I feeled the filter with about 3 tablespoons of nutmeg. I then pored the brew through a coffee filter. And I brewed it one more time, and filtered it one more time. I then poured in a cup. I then put a tea bag in it, but that wasn't enough. Then I found the key to the nutmeg taste. I found little packages of hat apple cider. It worked. It took about a hour before I started to feel it. First my jaw began to go numb. And the rest is history.
