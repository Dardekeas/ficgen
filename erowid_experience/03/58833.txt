Personal background:

I have tripped mushrooms and DXM dozens of times, as well as a few scattered acid trips.  I have also used opium and am a daily weed smoker.



Set and Setting:

I generally plans my trips about a week in advance, and make sure that I am in the right mental state for the trip.  However, this time was different. I had just attended a concert and was simply longing for a psychedelic perspective.  Acting somewhat impulsively, I ate approximately 2 grams of dank mushrooms at exactly midnight. I spent the majority of the trip lying in my bed.

----------------------------------------

The Experience:



00:00 ? I ate two relatively large caps, which in his experience are about a gram each.  I chewed them thoroughly before swallowing them with water. I then washed my face and brushed his teeth and prepared for bed.



00:20 ? I was very slightly high from the concert, but for the most part feel nothing significant.  I layed in bed listening to music.



00:45 ? I have had several psychedelic rushes over the last few minutes, and am quickly entering the experience.  These rushes seem more visual than mental, and are like a stone being occasionally thrown into a pond.  The dark stillness of the room is suddenly broken by colored ripples that flow across my vision.  These mushrooms are taking longer to kick in than I remember from previous experiences. I feel vaguely like I was in an airplane beginning to take off.



01:00 ? The effects are constantly increasing, and visual distortions are becoming stronger.  Sizes and proportions are greatly altered, although it is difficult to determine what specifically is different. My hands and arms seem shrunken and elongated, and my cat's body appears to be several yards long. I see faint lines and patterns that are changing colors, but they are still relatively faint. I believe the tail ends of my marijuana high are helping to drive these visuals and give them color. I am still experiencing very little mind fuck, and can think clearly.  This trip seems less mental and more visual than most of my previous trips.



02:00 ? The peak of the trip occurred somewhere on the 1:30 ?2:00 range.  The visuals where roughly the same intensity from an hour onward, but the mental effects peak somewhere during this time.  The world looks very ``shroomy'' and is overlade in colored moving lines that bend and flow and look somewhat like lines on a topographical map.  When I closes my eyes the visuals are much stronger, and pulse and move with the music.



02:30 ? Although the visuals are still strong, the peak has passed and I feel vaguely empty.  For some reason, I don't feel like I'm is tripping, even though the world looks very distorted.



03:00 ? The last half hour has been somewhat boring. I somehow feel un-stimulated mentally, and instead am rolling grudgingly with the experience.  The trip is not incredibly strong, and is very neutral mentally. I feel neither happiness nor sadness, and instead feel somewhat tired and unnecessarily drugged.



03:30 ? I understand better why tripping should not be done impulsively and late at night. I am not having a bad trip, it is just not overly exciting and it is keeping me from sleep. I feel stimulated, and the shroomy world doesn't feel very magical.



03:35 ? I decide that I am done with this trip, and am ready for bed.  I fish around in my pill stash until I find a small redish pill.  It is a 25mg Quetiapine (Seroquel).  These pills are extremely sedating.  I occasionally use these to help me sleep, since it kicks Ambien's ass, and is the only drug I have tried that lets me sleep the whole night without interruption. I have heard that Seroquel works like Thorazine, and can help to end a psychedelic experience.



03:50 ? I feel more tired, and strangely more sober, but this is probably mostly placebo.



04:00 ? About 25 minutes after taking the pill I feel VERY sedated, and my visuals are at about 20\% of what they were before the pill.  I get up and go to the bathroom, and I see some texturing on the tile floor, but nothing like earlier in the experience.



04:10 ? I feel very heavy, and close my eyes and fall asleep easily. I have never been able to fall asleep only 4 hours after dosing mushrooms.



10:30 ? I wake up and feel slightly hung over, as tends to happen after a short night on any sleeping pill.



Conclusion and Thoughts:



I was surprised how well the Seroquel worked in helping me relax and eventually sleep.  Besides the sedating effects of the pill (which really are quite powerful), the Seroquel seemed to directly cancel the effects of the psychedelic.  It destroyed the visuals, and made the world seem much more sane.  The only downside was the hangover, and the drug seemed to entirely block the positive afterglow I often get from a night of tripping, and instead left me feeling tired and wiped out.



I think it is a much more positive experience to ride out a trip if possible, since this leaves me happy and surprisingly energetic the next day.  However, I was impressed with the Seroquel, and would recommend it as a last ditch action to abort a bad trip. I wasn't tripping very hard when I took the pill, but I think it would still work at least partially for a stronger trip.  Whenever I trip in the future, I will keep Seroquel on hand as a final safety measure to avoid bad experiences.
