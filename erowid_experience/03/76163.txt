I have taken Neo Doves in pill format, Mephedrone and Methylene previously - but this was my first go at 4-FMP/4FA.



The plastic envelope for 1g of this compound reads:

4-FMP/4-FA

1-(4-Fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine Purity:98.2+\%



I inhaled a very thin line [50 mg approx.] as this was my first time and the pain was excruciating, more so than any of the others mentioned above -- I thought my nose was bleeding!  But it wasn't.  After a few long seconds the area between my teeth and nose went slightly numb, and then teeth felt a bit sore.  



Also, it left a vestige smell of burnt plastic in my nose, which was disconcerting to say the least.  We got this from our usual source so I think this is just the natural smell of the compound, but maybe I'm wrong?  The smell went away quickly.



I only inhaled 50 mg but it was enough to get a mild and pleasant rush of energy.  After about 5 minutes, I could feel it moving down my throat and feeling sort of refreshing.  I had a runny nose for sometime.



I don't think I'd be able to snort much more than a couple of lines -- next time I think I'll bomb 100mg, but initial impression is good.



Got slightly anxious after a couple of hours and had absolutely no appetite until the next day (I took it at 16:00) -- had some difficulty sleeping too.
