So this was my first experience with Lotus, and all in all I was very pleased.



On a the first warm Saturday night of 2006, about a week ago, I had several friends over to philosophize and smoke Salvia (1x gravity bong). I am a sort of evangelical when it comes to Salvia, and I try and get others to smoke it at every opportunity. I feel it helps a person tell the truth to himself or herself. 



Anyway, I had planned on splitting 15 g of Blue Lotus raw leaf with 2 friends as a tea. I boiled the leaf in a tea ball for fifteen minutes and made about 6 tea-cups worth of tea. Once of my friends thought it was `not her thing' after tasting, so really only had one mug. I consumed maybe 3 small tea mugs of lotus and managed to take a good strong dose of Salvia. Me and the afore mentioned girl usually trip very hard on Salvia, and my friend, for whom it was his `first time' also had an unusually powerful salvia trip after about twenty minutes after drinking the lotus. For some reason he couldn't speak in complete sentences, but uttered words phrases such as ``the carped in my old house'' and ``too many thoughts, so delicious\ldots'' when asked. He was almost catatonic and I was really worried that I had launched him into a bad trip, but he would assure me with very short phrases that things were good. He saw ``territories of color'' and such. He had a good trip, and from what I hear, spectacular visuals for plain Salvia leaf. His girlfriend, who tried the salvia along with him, only got a bit giggly (which is more than pot does for her). I don't know why so many people get no effect from Salvia raw leaf, but it always makes me sad for them.



I had had several tea cups worth of the lotus and a hit of salvia. The tea wasn't too bitter, and tastes a little like the very expensive Chinese tea wheels that have been fermenting for a while. It isn't as thick, but if you add a bag of Chinese green tea, it goes down quite naturally. Thirty minutes after taking the tea and two after smoking the salvia, I was getting some nice visual enhancement, though no true hallucinations. I didn't feel as spiritual as I normally do on salvia, there wasn't that element of mental struggle and revelation---I just didn't feel like ``doing it.'' The tranquilizing effects of the Lotus were wonderful, and it was really quite euphoric. I really wanted my small lady friend to cuddle. I don't think I could have managed sex if I tried, but I really just wanted to hold someone, to be near another warm person. It made her skin absolutely glow.



We decided to smoke some weed (always a good idea when you can barely move). The salvia and lotus were both consumed within an hour of each other, and a good hour later, the marijuana was introduced. The first girl (call her B) and I got really giggly and got most of the `pot effects' without the cotton-headed feeling that normally comes from getting stoned on weed found in the North East. Once the giggles subsided, we kinda just laid down and didn't say anything for a while. One of us (the guy, call him S) was still mostly catatonic, but seemed happy, his girlfriend holding him and coming down from her salvia trip. They seemed very synchronized in their silence. B and I couldn't move. From the sternal corpus outward was not quite numb, not quite heavy, but completely without the will to action, and from B's change in complexion I could tell she was getting something too (didn't bother to ask). I felt alert, awake, very happy (despite the dawning knowledge that I would get no where with B as I had fantasized), and paid a lot of attention to the Moroccan Flag hanging on the wall opposite me in my room. It was hypnotic. Though at the time, I was well past the window when the salvia's effects usually wear off, I saw the star, green on a red field, attempting to `rotate' very slowly in place.



My roommate comes in and sees us all immobile and decided to bet me \$50 that I couldn't go outside and pick up his Frisbee from a location visible out of my window. I couldn't take the bet. Honestly I couldn't do it, though it was less than 300 total feet away. Walking didn't seem important, neither did money. I wasn't really `happy' or `sad' or anything so clear, I kinda just ``was,'' and that can be very nice. It was a pleasant experience free of passion. The experience wasn't perfect because of the lingering desire for sexuality which doesn't really go away with any drug I have ever tried accept Mescaline, and the more intense side of Salvia or Mushrooms (then you can't even reach the idea of sex your so far out of it). 



Anyway, though Lotus is fairly expensive for an Herbal drug, it gives a wonderful ``light, alert-but-tranquil, and all around decent'' feeling. Baseline returns after perhaps 4 hours, 11pm-3pm in this case. 



Somewhere in that whole affair we all managed to drink a little, but not more than a shot or two's worth of Jagermeister or Vodka for any one person. It probably helped the Lotus too. It was sorta the conversational drinking that college kids do so well. For a normally talkative bunch we were all very mellow.



The next day my throat was sore, but that was certainly from the pot and salvia and had nothing to do with the lotus. I had pains in my left supraspinatus muscle, trapezius, and general scapula area, but that likely came from propping in a weird position for forty minutes or so when I didn't care to move. Be safe friends, and someday reason will prevail.
