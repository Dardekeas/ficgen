First off let me state that mixing drugs can be dangerous, especially so when you are talking about research chemicals. Of course the deranged person who told me this story is not as safety minded as you or I and has been known to experiment with cocktails and dosages I would not personally condone. While this report is written in first person, it is a transcript, I do not personally use illicit substances because the government taught me it was bad. 



Wednesday was a strange day. I had to leave work early because I had a follow up doctor appointment from an ER visit on Sunday. I had to go to the ER for Thrombosed Hemorrhoids, which if you don't know what they are\ldots  consider yourself lucky. They hurt like hell. My insurance requires that I see my primary care physician with in 72 hours of receiving care at an emergency room, so I found myself at my personal doctors on Wednesday. Well I got bad news, the ER hadn't done such a hot job cutting the blood clots out of my sphincter so my doc made me an urgent appointment with a rectal surgeon.



My appointment with the surgeon wasn't until 4 pm so I had about 2 hours to kill and went home. When I was leaving for the appointment I found an envelope from China in the mail\ldots  Oh boy! A new batch of RC's\ldots  suddenly my pain was lifted for a moment from the excitement. But off to the ASSMAN I went. 



I am new to the hemorrhoid game and didn't fully know what to expect other then the minor work they had done in the ER. What followed was the most painful experience of my life. You see, I metabolize local anaesthetics like those in the `caine' family very quickly and lose the numbness it provides sooner then most people. The actual cutting out of the clots went well\ldots  other then the humility of having my buttcheeks taped wide open while the doc had his way with me. But then the nightmare started\ldots  he poured on the Silver Nitrate to cauterize my incision\ldots  the numbness had worn down and on top of that it entered into the deep tissue\ldots  the next 30 minutes were excruciating pain. 



I had nearly forgot about the RC's when I escaped with a prescription for Percocet which I needed badly since I had been eating Vicodan all week to deal with the pain and had just run out. Finally at home with the next day off and a full supply of drugs the story begins.



The chemical I was most curious about was 5-meo-dalt, I had minor expectations from the trip reports online, and I had already experimented with some of the JWH compounds previously. That first night I put 25mg in a gelcap and swallowed it down. After 2 hours I didn't notice much of anything. I took another 30mg gelcap and smoked 10mg of it\ldots  about 20 minutes later I felt a mild effect. I smoked another 10mg. Still not much notable effect. About 3 hours after the initial dose I suddenly felt the familiar `about to trip' rush and butterflies then a body buzz built until it was rather pleasant and strong, my mind began to wander and I noticed although I was `tripping' it was quite different then usual, more relaxed\ldots  I had control, not so many gimmicks. This feeling built for about 45 minutes then tapered off, about an hour later I experienced a very similar build up and another 30 minutes of decent effects which I have to assume was the second capsule finally making it's way through my bloodstream. I was pleased with the experience but it didn't seem right. 



The next day I doubled the dosage and mimicked the administration route\ldots  similar effects but again took very long to come on. I noticed that during the build up phase time crawled to a snails pace, then after the peak it sped up a little like an amphetamine high. I was still missing something though, the effects seemed muted somehow.



On Friday I had to return to work, my poor buttocks still aching in pain and the Percocet barely helping me through the day. While I was working I started thinking about the 5-meo-dalt and realized it must be the gelcaps that were the problem. I couldn't wait to get home and try putting the dose in a shot of a beverage. When I got home at 3 pm I took two 5mg percocets and took a 30 minute hot bath to sooth my roid wounds. Around 4 pm I weighed out 30mg of 5-meo-dalt. I grabbed a bottle of orange juice from the fridge and poured a shot of it into a shot glass. I tapped the 30mg of 5-meo-dalt into the drink. It fizzed a little and I tossed it back. The taste was horrible, awful bitter, it worried me. I checked the expiration of the juice\ldots  over 2 weeks ago\ldots  yuck. 



After washing the disgusting taste from my mouth I packed about a quarter gram of good pot in my roor bong. I topped the bowl with 10mg each of JWH-018, 073 \& 200 and 15mg of JWH-250. I melted the small mound of powder gently with the lighter and vaped a nice hit with the proximity flame, then smoked down the rest in 3 or 4 big rips. 



It was about 4:15 and I was certainly feeling a little different already. The buildup had already begun, time slowed even more then my previous experiences, and I was overwhelmed with a euphoric body buzz. I had to close my eyes and lay down. The body buzz was still euphoric but began to take on a bit of an overwhelmingly so characteristic, my skin was flush and clammy. I noticed that instead of racing like my mind normally does on psychedelics it was instead profoundly calm, even comforting of the intensifying body load that was starting to be a bit uncomfortable. My jaw was clenching now and my teeth hurt a bit. I noticed that where my pain was most intense from the hemorrhoid was now replaced with a more pleasurable warm feeling then the rest of my body, like the pain receptors had been reversed. I had noticed this in my previous two experiences as well. 



While my mind was abnormally calm for being in such an altered state, and I felt relatively in control of myself, it was also very open and in that `outside the box' type of mode where I was able to view things in a different light. I thought of something I read previously in the week that said something along the lines of `you have learned very well how to speak to god (prayer), now you need to work on listening to god (meditation)'. It struck me that this chemical was working to help me listen to the universal wisdom and not just ask it questions. My closed eyes were filled with bright white light several times while my thoughts drifted through different philosophical and personal matters. I opened my eyes after what felt like several hours and saw that it was only 4:50. I noticed I was coming down, the body load began to dissipate and I was left with a warm fuzzy glow and happy state of mind. At around 5:15 I noticed time begin to speed up again and felt lingering effects until around 6 pm when I packed another bong load. By 7 pm I was baseline other then a marijuana and JWH buzz from another bongload. 



I am very pleased with 5-meo-dalt and look forward to more experiments. I want to try lowering the dose to 20 mg next time to see if it reduces the body load a little. One thing I can tell you is to ditch the gelcaps with this one, much better in the nude. I am curious if the orange juice may have made any difference in the effects and will use water next time to compare. I didn't notice any hangover type feelings, but can agree with the others who mentioned it can be a bit moreish.
