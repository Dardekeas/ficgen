A year before the most embarrassing night of my life I had discovered marijuana.  I had moved from Washington to Kentucky over the prior summer, and I was starting a new life; starting high school.  I was nervous as hell going to high school without knowing a single person, but I took it as a chance to be the person I never was in Washington.  I took it upon myself to become one of the `cool kids.'  I think most people know who the `cool kids' are.  The perception probably changes from person to person, from high school to high school.  For me, the `cool kids' were the ones who smoked pot before school, or drank from the bottles in their parent's liquor cabinet.  I wasn't a cool kid in Washington, that's for sure.  But, here, in Kentucky, this was my time to shine, and I did, amazingly.



I picked who I thought were the `cool kids' and cozied up nice to them.  Before I knew it, they had accepted me, and offered to get me high for my \_very first time\_.  I was uncontrollably excited.  D.A.R.E. had only made me want to try these forbidden drugs even more.  I never had access to them until now, now that the cool kids had taken interest in me.  So, a year before the most embarrassing night of my life, New Year's Eve, 1998, I was invited to smoke pot for the first time in my life at a cool kids house.  Life couldn't have been better that night, the cool kids liked me, and I had found a new hobby: marijuana.



After that moment, I smoked every chance I could get.  Being high took away the feelings of self-consciousness I always had lingering around myself.  I felt I could make friends easily when I was high; I felt secure in myself, I felt like I wasn't just `the new kid.'  This all lasted until the conclusion 1999, when in that short duration, the cool kids no longer wanted me around.  I didn't smoke as much pot anymore, and I spent more time by myself.  I was fine with this, as I had spent a lot of time this way, having moved so often and barely having friends.



But now, I felt empty.  Things felt wrong, and I longed for something better.  I wanted to go back to Washington so badly.  My reasons were shaky, but for some reason, Washington became mystified to me, some holy grail of happiness I had to give up.  So, imagine my delight when I was invited again to the same cool kids house, New Years Eve, 1999, to smoke pot, again.



The night started out normally enough, I smoked, I felt wonderful, and things were falling into place again.  Then, someone new showed up.  Like I said, marijuana made it easy for me to make friends, so I immediately liked this new `cool kid.'  This new cool kid was offering everyone pills.  I took some.  I was told vaguely what they were:



`Anti-depressants, apparently they do something to you.'



`Ok,' says I, and down a few, proving I can keep up with any cool kid.



Later in the night, I become anxious.  I feel my body convulsing; light twitching that seems amplified by my acute sense of it.  I wonder if my twitching is noticeable.  I want to ask the people I'm with if they notice my twitching, but I can't form the words.  I can talk, that's for sure, but the words won't come out right.  I find myself talking for too long of a time about something that doesn't make sense anymore.  Trying to articulate my embarrassing (possibly unseen) twitching just led to more embarrassment.  I could tell I was worrying my party, and I became worried myself.



`What were those pills?' I demanded to know.



`We told you, anti-depressants.'



`Jesus fucking Christ, what did you give me?  I feel like I'm dying.'



`Calm down.'



`What did you give me, just tell me.'



My paranoia was out of control, and I had never felt a state of distrust like this in my life.  I think it might've been a product of being chewed up and spit out by the `cool kids.'  Within a year they were my friend, and then just ditched me.  Like I said, things like this had happened before, but I suppose marijuana never played a factor.



`Fine, it's LSD.' One of them says to calm me down.



`Really?' Oddly enough, this does calm me.  Whoever said this was probably just trying to help me out, make me feel more secure.  I obviously wanted some answer, and wouldn't take `anti-depressants' as one.  I accepted this answer, for some reason, I accepted it.  I had never done LSD, so I didn't know what to expect.  The people I was with offered to `help me through it.'  For the rest of the night they would ask me what I saw, and I would tell them something, fully immersed in my `LSD' high.  Honestly, I don't quite remember what I said, or what I saw.  I remember feeling disappointed at the lack of effect LSD had on me, and taking more of the pills, but other than that, I don't remember.



The next morning I was told I hadn't taken LSD, that the pills were, in fact, Zoloft.  I was the butt of a joke.  I felt like huge idiot.  I was embarassed beyond belief, and I wanted to go home immediately.  The new millennium started out with me being the biggest joke in Kentucky.



I never spent another day with the `cool kids.'  I feel like I've lost a part of myself since then.  I don't enjoy pot like I once did; in fact, at the worst while high I have intense panic attacks and extreme moments of self-loathing and self-consciousness.  At the best, I feel tired, and a little zoned out.  I don't know if trust plays a factor in pot smoking, but the experience has never been the same for me.  I feel like I've lost my trust in humanity.  As dramatic as that sounds, it's terrifying to think someone you trust is laughing at you without your knowledge.



I no longer live in Kentucky.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who puts up with my shit, and is helping me through my insecurities, and lack of trust in people.  I just wish I could feel like I used to when I was high.  Sometimes I think I glorify things gone by, and sometimes I think I've already peaked in life.  Sometimes I feel like a big fucking idiot, and the deserving butt of every joke.
