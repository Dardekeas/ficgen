I went to HARD Haunted Mansion last Halloween and decided to try 2-CE for the first time.  I had done my research, and I was comfortable going into the night.  My only worry was that I would throw up in line in front of security and not be let into the event.  I took a couple of doses of pepto bismol just after dosing to try to prevent this.



I took what I thought was 12 mg of 2-CE at around 9:00 PM, though the scale was only accurate to 3 mg.  My friend took the same dose at the same time, also her first experience with 2-CE.



I had experimented with mushrooms and LSD around 10 times before this experience, and I am a daily marijuana smoker.  I expected the 2-CE to hit me after about 45 minutes, and was getting quite nervous as it became clear that the line to get in would take more like an hour.



But by the time we finally got into the event at 10:15, I was still feeling stone cold sober.  I decided to wait it out just in case the pepto bismol had somehow slowed the onset of effects, but by 11:00 PM I had given up on tripping that night.  My friend who had dosed with me also felt no effects, so she took some LSD and began tripping on that.



I saw someone smoking a bowl and explained my sad situation to them.  They graciously offered me some bowl rips, and I happily obliged.  As soon as I took a hit, I felt an INTENSE head rush.  I actually got nervous that I had smoked something besides marijuana for a second because it felt so different than getting high normally.  I immediately turned to my friend and said, `I'm tripping.'



But for the rest of the night, I couldn't quite figure out if I was in fact tripping.  I kept seeing crazy, acid-like patterns, both with my eyes closed and open, but for some reason I couldn't shake the thought that I was `imagining' the patterns, i.e. that I was making them up as opposed to really seeing them.  Obviously this is a ridiculous concern, since drug hallucinations are always imagined.  But I couldn't get rid of the thought.



I was having an alright time dancing, liking the music, and the lights, but from 11:00 PM to whenever the rave ended (12:00 AM?), I was stuck in a thought loop that just repeated over and over and over, sometimes in a funny way, but mostly in an annoying way.  Once I got back to campus, I lay in bed with my eyes closed talking to my girlfriend for hours, happily watching the patterns zoom by whenever I closed my eyes.



After that night, my initial reaction was that I just hadn't done enough.  I figured I probably ended up with only around 9 mg because of the imprecise scale, and my experience was consistent with low doses of 2-CE.  I was eager to try it again, likely in a different setting, and at a higher dose.



However, for the few months after this experience, I got stuck in many negative recurring thought loops.  Particularly in the shower, when I had time to just zone out and think about things, I would find myself coming back to a negative thought I had just had two minutes earlier over and over.  The thought loops really bothered me, and I consciously fought to overcome them.  They got rarer and rarer as more time elapsed, finally disappearing after 3 or 4 months.



The other main after-effect I experienced from 2-CE was that I now see crazy 2-CE patterns when I close my eyes when I'm very high on marijuana sometimes.  I believe 2-CE has the ability to provide an amazing experience at more appropriate doses, but I find the after-effects disconcerting.  Many of my friends who have tried it also describe it as `sticky,' meaning that some effects linger long past when the actual trip ends.
