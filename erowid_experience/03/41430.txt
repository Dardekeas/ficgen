I had done 2CI on several occassions before tonight, when I got the idea to snort a little and have a quick experience before going to bed. every previous experience with the drug had been amazing, rewarding beyond belief. I was looking around online for reports of experiences with insufflated 2CI, and I didn't find much out. I was wondering what the difference was between this and an oral dose. I decided to be brave and try it myself, albeit a small dose of what I estimate to be 5 mg. 



HOLY SH*T. this was one of the most painful things I've ever put up my nose. a lasting burning like the worst strep throat ever. DEFINITELY not something I want to be experiencing before something as potentially overwhelming as a 2CI trip. 



As for it's effects, I don't really know, nor do I care. I tried to wash as much of it out as possible with nasal spray and I'm sitting here sucking on cough drops trying to rid myself of the burn. I just did it about half an hour ago, and no effect yet, though I don't expect any.



Is it even water soluble?



In short, there is NO reason to put it up my nose. An average oral dose is amazing enough and painless. I imagine if I was tripping now that my trip would revolve largely around how much my throat is burning. What a horrible experience that would be!
