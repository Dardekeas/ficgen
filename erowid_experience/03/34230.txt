I enjoy opiates.  Almost too much so.  I have never done Heroin, nor would I ever.  I don't partake very often at all, mainly because vicodin is hard to come by, and Poppy Pods are not cheap, and not to mention a bit labor intensive.  It has been roughly 2 months since I have done anything.  The taste of Poppy tea is pretty disgusting.  I have heard it referred to as drinking the `attic floor,' and I would say that is a pretty accurate description.  The more repulsive it tastes, the more stoned I am likely to get.  This may be an illusory correlation, but I have noticed it to be true with my experience.  My gag reflex got lots of exercise during every cup.  If you hear someone tell you that potency varies, and to be careful it is NO JOKE.  I ordered 50 dried Giganthemum pods for \$100 and change many months ago.  They were the biggest sized pods, and from the research I have done the most potent.  



Dosage was all over the place the first few times I did it.  One time I would be reasonably mellow, and the next I would literally be to the point that I would start to puke if I moved out of a reclined position (NOT GOOD.)  I would have to sit completely still with my eyes closed, or it would be completely terrible, and that is an understatement.  Since I have only ordered one batch, and probably wont order again, I have recognized that there are so many variables involved in preparation, from how long I steep them, inclusion of acid (lemon juice) for extraction, water temp, etc. etc. that it would take some time to pin down how to get the same thing every time (Dangerously so I might add.)  And tolerance shifts with time, and that does not make it any easier. 



After about the 3rd time of getting misserably more bombed than I was expecting, I did some reading and learned from a more experienced individual, who always takes 100\% of the entire order, grinds all of them in a coffee grinder, and mixes all of the `flower' in a mason jar by shaking until it is one big homogenous mixture.  It takes a while, so set aside a few hours.  From there, you can get tablespoon reccomendatons from several web sites, or just go at it with a low amount starting with a tablespoon or so until you hit desired effects.  I had better luck this way, and did not hit the miserable nausea of getting what I would consider dangerously high. It is astounding how a tiny amount of powder is the result of grinding a single pod.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# 



After buying one batch, I am not interested in consuming opiates in this manner.  There were a few intensely unpleasant times, which looking back on, I would say it is safe to use the word `DANGEROUS' when describing them.  Considering I am highly meticulous and pay a great deal of attention to detail and took too much, I would not trust a few of my care-free get stoned NOW and worry later friends with the stuff.  There were deffinately enjoyable expereinces, but it also did not always feel clean.  Sometimes I will crack open a pod, and it will be completely black and molded on the inside.  You dont have any clue about post dry storage, possible treatment with chemicals for `ornamental' purposes, etc.  It also takes time every time I am going to do it.  And if I am going to do it right and all the way, I need to let the stuff sit for hours.
