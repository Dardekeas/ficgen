I have been a heroin addict for many years now.  I have tried almost everyway to get off the stuff as anyone.  Using other opioids : oxycodone, oxycontin, etc. to no avail.  Then I ran into a drug called Suboxone and this stuff worked wonders, took the withdrawal symptoms away without getting me high.  It seemed like a wonder drug, but like anything else it made me withdraw from it.  



This brings me to Tramadol.  My dog broke his hipbone and the Vet. prescribed him Tramadol which knocked him out.  I researched it a bit and decided to try it.  This drug is the first drug I have ever taken to help my withdrawals without giving me withdrawals. Tramadol is helping me get through it, and when I don't take it the effects aren't incapacitating like on opiates.
