After doing some research on nutmeg, I decided to give it a try on one boring Sunday afternoon. I filled clear gelcaps with nutmeg, yes, it sounds like a bit of work, but I was able to fill one ounce worth the capsules in about 10 min. I took the nutmeg and sat down to wait for the effects. Six hours later I was maybe feeling a little light-headed. I was rather disappointed with the results, and went to bed. The next morning I woke up and again felt a little light-headed, but not much. I then went to class (I'm a college student) and that is when it hit me.



I felt like I had drank about 8 or 9 beers, but not in a real pleasurable way. It felt like a couple hours after I had 12 or so beers, and was coming down, and feeling a little tired and such. This was 8:30am, about 15 hours after I took the nutmeg. To make a long story short, I just got more tired, and felt more messed up all day. And while this was not altogether unpleasant, it was not that much fun either. I slept most of the day, skipping the rest of my classes and meals. I then slept all night, and when I awoke in the morning, I was still a little light headed until about noon. So I had felt the effects for basically 36 hours after taking it. The only really negative effect was my eyes, nose and mouth were incredibly dry for those two days.



Good Luck!!!
