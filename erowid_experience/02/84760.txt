Kinda looking for alternatives to speed, coke or mdma for legal, cost \& other reasons. Very recently snorted a few lines of Meph for the first time, during the day at work, a line an hour for about 6 hours starting at 10am. Doses started small \& worked up but average about 25 or 30mg each.



I've been advised that a swallowed dose of Meph is different so I'll be trying that in future.



I agree that there are certainly similarities with mdma, \& also with coke\ldots  the short duration \& need to redose is very coke-y, so is the high, slightly edgy \& anxiety-inducing\ldots  That slight anxious feeling will be familiar to anyone who's come up on mdma. There was also a warm, comfortable feeling which predominated, \& I enjoyed a strong, energetic feeling \& music sounded brilliant! I felt kinda horny, \& am looking forward to trying this drug with my girlfriend \ldots 



By the end of the day I'd eaten very little \& 24 hours later still had very little appetite\ldots  I'm small \& sensitive to chemicals, \& having chuffed up no more than 180mgs over 6 hours was quite surprised to be feeling pretty rough in the evening. My heart rate remained elevated quite some time after the pyschoactive effects had worn off \& I suffered an hour or so of anxiety-related chest pain, very common for me on mdma come-up or during a stressful, every-day situation. I ingested a small 2.5 mg dose of valium about 9pm \& managed a relatively normal nights sleep. felt okay-ish next morning, not 100\%, sorta like a mild alcohol or phet or coke hangover. It was NOT like an mdma hangover.



I reckon I could've done without the last 2 or 3 doses. I reckon 4 lines maximum, for me, about 30mg each will be fine for an evening. I'll get a couple hours of fun, plus the after-stimulation which lasted at least a couple hours after the drug had worn off. Insomnia seems less likely with lower doses.



My experience is clearly limited with Meph but I know my way around stims \& psychedelics \& I'm sorry to say, despite my limited experience, I agree that this substance should be banned. It's simply not safe having this stuff available to use cheaply \& indisciminately regardless of age or mental health status\ldots  Mdma SHOULD be legal, so that people would be less likely to seek what I suspect may be a considerably more harmful \& addictive substance, like Mephedrone.



I have not tried bk-mdma (Methylone) yet\ldots  but if \& when I do I shall report back, sah!



A WEEK LATER!



So\ldots  I can now report on my first methylone sesh at the weekend. I found it a very interesting substance, equal if not slightly stronger in equal quantities of mdma (for me \& my gf anyway) \& with a longer experience. My usual usage of mdma is in the very smallest quantities. I'm not fond of the full-on rush \& prefer my highs to kinda creep in. Ive always had breaks \& kept my dosage down, despite nearly 20 years of experience with mdma, \& I'm still quite capable of feeling the magic on low doses. My ideal dosages of pure, chrystal mdma is 25mg an hour. I rarely go for more than 4 or 6 hours, so my average doses are pretty low\ldots  



I'm senstive to chems \& I'm a fit, lean 50 kgs. I've only on perhaps 3 occassions had what I'd call a binge Lol In Ibiza one night we started early \& ended late \& I did 2 pills in quarters, \& a week later we did one \& a half\ldots  That was a binge! Another time I kept the 25 mg an hour up for enough time to use up about 300 mgs\ldots  London fest with Faithless, stayed up all night \& well into Sunday! I think I may have push the boat out once more, but I dont remember it\ldots 



Anyway\ldots  myself \& my gf began with 50mgs in rizla 5:30pm, crunched between teeth \& swallowed fast with water, this about an hour after a 3mg tongue dab to test for wierd reactions. We went for a walk in the park. The usual familiar lightness of being set in at about the usual time, within 20 minutes \& I felt as if I felt at that point as if I'd discovered an identical substitute to mdma. We walked \& talked \& enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, returning home at the hour mark to ingest a further 25 mgs. I think this perhaps a slight mistake as some aspects of the experience later became a bit irritating \& they may have been less obvious \& more shortlived had the further dose not been administered. But, as I say we felt great at that time so, off we went, back out side with a total 75mgs in us. 



Again we enjoyed the energy rush but this time conversation turned dark. Some body-load became apparent \& I found myself resisting a little, to the point where a mild, anxiety related chest pain set in. I'm very familiar with this feeling, from being in awkward or scarey situations on E so, although I was aware of it, I wasnt bothered\ldots  Our discussions turned very anti-estabilishment \& government critical, based around the premise the bk-mdma was less perfect a drug than mdma \& more risky due to it's new-ness \& that it was stupid that we should resort to this drug when we could have pure, research quality mdma! 



Many other deep \& political, but often dark, matters were discussed. Personally, with the benefit of hindsight I blame most of this on media reporting of the `meph crisis', \& the fact that we were effectively experimenting on ourselves not so much to enjoy the trip but to study the effects of this fascinating \& soon to be banned substance. Anyway, the entire experience surprised us by lasting much longer than expected \&, if it werent for the darkness \& minor anxiety, which my gf also felt, the duration would have been a blessing. 



It wasnt until well into the next morning that it's effects subsided but sleep still wasnt possible without valium, 10mgs about 4 am, nearly 12 hours after initiation. Overall, bit too long, shame it was a vagualey dark trip but we DID feel good about the darkness, if you get me Lol We also felt a bit addled by the drug \& this was increased by weed smoking. Next time we're trying smaller doses over a longer period, \& if that doesnt work we're trying a bigger, one-off dose. But I have a feeling we may need valium ON Methylone if we've going to ba able to really enjoy it, to dampen the subtle but obvious anxiety it seems to produce.



With both Mephedrone \& Methylone trips now under my belt, I can definitely say that both these drugs, although they emulate many of mdma's effects (each in their own way) are slightly more inclined to promote an anxious, more amphetamine like high than mdma \& that although Methylone seems to come close, they both lack that subtle, beautiful, blissful euphoria of pure mdma. I believe this is to do with the Cathinone substitute, that it gives a more addled high, less focused than with pure speed or cocaine, but with the anxiousness of both. I've noticed, to the plus for both Meph \& Methylone however, that the hangovers are also a bit amphetamine like, in that they are harder \& more immediate, with a distinct decrease in that `Tues blues' feeling days later. Both myself \& my gf definitely suffered some very obvious, irritable moments the next day \& we were both nakkered. But we've both had worse comedowns of mdma.
