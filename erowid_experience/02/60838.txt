Around two years ago I got interested in absinthe, and all the `green fairy' tales. After researching Absinthe, its active substances, etc\ldots  I decided to try and smoke wormwood, to get a `thujone' high.



(first time) 

I did the `thujone hash', and rolled it in a joint: the wormwood hash mixed with tobacco.

- didn't really feel anything.



(second time)

I made more of the hash, but this time I smoked it almost pure in a joint.

- no effect whatsoever



(third time)

This time I made around the same amout of hash as in the first time, but decided to smoke it in a pipe.

I was convinced that nothing would happen, but here it goes.



T+0:00

I put the hash on the pipe and off I went. The smoke was light and barely noticeable



T+0:05

stopped smoking and went to the bathroom. When I open the door, the whole toilet looked like a sauna, it looked as if I had smoked in there.



T+0:07

I turn on some music and lie in bed just mildly appreciating the music, and the curtains which appeared to move in a wavyish way. I felt really comfortable with the whole atmosphere.



T+0:15

I sit on my chair to turn the music off, but the bass box seems to get larger, so I just stare at it trying to convince myself it's not growing.



T+0:25

I feel normal again.



My experience was pretty nice, but very short. I think that it worked better on the pipe rather than rolled.
