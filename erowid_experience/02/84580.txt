The JWH-018 and JWH-073 I use regularly, and did not feel any effects from with this experience. The JWH's were overpowered, but used, so I listed them.



I have used 5-MeO-DALT before this, taking orally in doses of 25mg. With good experiences, this was my 1st and last time smoking this chemical. I have a good milligram scale, so measurements are accurate.



So I have heard that 5-MeO-DALT is best when smoked. With 25mg being (what I thought as) a small amount, and not too much when taken orally. I thought it would be a good amount to experiment with.



Packed a bowl of some `spice' like incense, which contains both JWH-018 and JWH-073, put 25mg of 5-MeO-DALT on top and fired up. Did not taste to bad, effects were felt immediately after exhaling.



Let me remind you, this is one hit.



Less than 1 minute- Intense rush takes over my body, with immediate color and pattern changing visuals. Becomes overwhelming very fast.



2 min- Heart rate is through the roof, I feel like its going to explode. Add that to the visuals and I'm scared out of my mind. I stay in this overwhelming/way too high panic state for around 1 hour.



60 min- With the overwhelming part of the high gone, I'm in a kind of speedy euphoria, with some visual effects effects along with tracers present.



120min- Effects wearing off slowly, last in total around 3.5 to 4 hours.



Easy come down. No side effects noticed. But it was enough for me. It might be pleasurable when smoked in smaller quantities, but I'm not willing to try.



Note: I have used meth, coke, and was even addicted to crack (very bad shit) for a short while. NOTHING has ever made my heart pound like this did. Scared the hell out of me. I REALLY do not recommend trying this.
