Well, it all happened Feb. 23 on a Monday evening. I had managed to get a baggie of cyclobenzaprine containing around 22 pills. Before that, I had bought a quarter sack. This was the first time I had ever taken cyclobenzaprine. I took one because I wasn't sure what would happen and I didn't want to over do it. After an hour, I still wasn't feeling anything, except I had became drowsy. I decided I was going to take another one. After about 20 minutes after taking the second pill, I felt something. Not much..but I felt\ldots `different'. It was a relaxed feeling that I enjoyed. I liked it so much, I took another. Before even given the chance to kick in, about 5 minutes later, I took another. I figured..'ah..why not'. Nothing bad yet..everything was fine. Then my friend (we'll call him Rodney) came over and mentioned me buying the quarter bag. I didn't want to smoke really since I had 40mg of cyclobenzaprine in my system. (My body isn't in all that good of shape from all the drugs I have done. But I am not an addict. I can quit cold turkey when ever I feel like doing so.) 



Finally my friend, Rodney, had talked me into smoking with him. The shit I had was supposed to be some of the best chronic. We smoked 3 bowls, one after another. I was feeling rather sick to my stomach and noticed a change in my heart rate. On the forth bowl, I passed it up after I hit it once. I started looking around and everything around me was spinning and I could feel my heart beat throughout my entire body. I started freaking myself out because I kept thinking my heart was beating extremely fast. I didn't want to believe that it was. Hoping that I was just imagining it all, I felt for my heartbeat in my neck. My heart was racing. It started to feel like my heart was going to just come right out of my chest. All of a sudden, my left arm went numb. I couldn't really feel it. When I moved it, it would tingle. I told my friend Rodney I wasn't feeling well and I went to go lay down. Bad mistake. I got into my room and layed down on my bed and tried to just relax, taking deep breaths. Didn't help at all. 



Out of the blue, I got a shock throughout my whole body. The shock was powerful enough to make me jump. I started freaking out hardcore and I didn't know what to do. I sat up and looked at the trash can and started debating on whether I should induce vomiting or not. After what seemed like hours, I got up and sat by the trash can and forced myself to puke. After a couple times of doing that, I felt somewhat better, but my heart was still beating extremely hard and fast. So, still scared, I sat in the floor and leaned back on my bed. Another shock jolted my body. I closed my eyes and gasped loudly because it had hurt and felt like the shock came from my heart. My heart continued to hurt and I felt a lot of pressure on my chest. I started breathing again, trying to just make myself calm down. Still not being able to feel my arm much, I stand up, having to immediately sit down on the bed because I felt like if I was to stand any longer, I would pass out. And of course, I thought that if I was to pass out, I wouldn't wake up. 



To myself, I kept thinking, `I will not go down without a fight. I can beat the drug' I tried telling myself over and over that it was just the drug, it was all in my mind. I sat on the bed and watched T.V. to try and get my mind off of my heart, which was still beating hard and fast. I sat there and watched the television for about an hour with my hand on my chest where I was able to feel my heart. After awhile I noticed my heart rate slowed down and wasn't beating as hard anymore. I let out a sigh of relief and relaxed, closing my eyes, trying to fall asleep. I layed there for awhile, but finally fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning, my body was shaky and my heart was slightly hurting. But I didn't pay it any attention and carried on with my day.



That was my first experiance with cyclobenzaprine. I had myself all freaked out about what was happening. To be honest, I kept thinking that I might have been having a heart attack. I tried to erase that thought out of my mind because I didn't want to believe that that's what it was. Before I has smoked the marijuana, I was feeling great. The thing I tried to avoid (the overdoing it part) ended up happening. Now, if you were to ask me if I was to do it again, I would have to say no, but if worse came to worse and I wanted to get high and didn't have anything else, then I might take a couple of the pills, but I wouldn't smoke any marijuana while on them.
