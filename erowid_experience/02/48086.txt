This drug can be useful for withdrawing from opiates or as an alternative to street heroin or other opiates. I feel my own experiences could provide solidarity perhaps for other users who have tipped the balance of sensibility\ldots  OK, now for my History:    

           

I have been continally prescribed 12 mg per day of buprenorphine (subutex)  as an alternative to methadone or a street heroin addiction for the last three years, before which I was a heroin addict for one and a half years. For the first year or so I just took 4mg per day sublingually and found that this held me, i.e.- stopped me from feeling withdrawal symptoms, for between 24-30 hours per dose. During this time, I discovered that although Buprenorphine did inhibit the effects of opiates, this greatly depended upon the dose; the individual, and the time elapsed after taking the dose. Simply, the higher the dose taken, the more effective at blocking other opiates for longer. 



I am sure that it could be considered `dangerous` for people to take benzodiazepines with buprenorphine, but I have taken large amounts of each, on many occasions, as have many people I know, and experienced nothing worse than the usual sedating effects of the benzos. If you have no tolerance to Opiates or Buprenorphine, it could be dangerous for people who aren`t used to it to mix it with too many benzos.

      

Amyway, onto a much more previously unmentioned subject, is the intravenous use of buprenorphine. I was injecting 12mg of Bup three times a day for a few weeks (before I went back on smack to stop fucking myself up, and now I have been on 4 x 2mg hits a day for about three months, but, hey!!), and found that it makes my veins very unelastic, hence I rapidly discovered the best way to prepare this drug for injection to minimalise bodily harm, although it is NEVER harmless to inject this stuff.

    

Anyway, as follows I:

1) place the appropriate dose of subutex or bup in my nice clean spoon. 

2) Add the correct amount of water so that I will be able to hit up in the appropriate quantity in one go, and then mix well with, preferably, the cap of a sterile works until I can feel no crumbs or grains in the spoon, within reason.  

3) LEAVE FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR for the impurities to settle, or as long as I can, then

4)  Get a clean filter, from a straight or a filter tip for a home-made, and cut a thinnish slice off it as I would a Swiss roll, so I still have a full width bit, but not too long. 

5) Drop this widthways into the centre of the spoon, so that the fibres run horizontally, and then proceed to slowly and carefully draw up the liquid through the filter. I should find that most of the impurities stay at the base of the spoon. 

6)  Whilst Intravenous injection is certainly not good for me, injecting into skin or muscles has been shown to lead to a high chance of developing abscesses on those sites. I have injected this stuff, foolishly, a great deal intravenously, missed a few times, but never had an abscess, although, it is bad for my overall circulation, veins, and spare a thought for the kidneys. 

   

It`s usually only worth doing if I'm so ill withdrawing from opiates then it can`t get any worse, but everythings relative and everybody`s different, so hey, this is my contribution anyway.
