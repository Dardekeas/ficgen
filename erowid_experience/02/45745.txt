Well, I bought about 16OZ of powdered calamus from an online vendor. I had just got home from work when I got my calamus. I have read that calamus was suppose to be a stimulant, but yet has a calming effect. According to the native Americans it fights pain and fatique, and can be used to travel great distances.



Well I took about 2 1/2 teaspoon worth of this stuff, and man was this stuff nasty. The taste made me wanna almost threw up. I also read that people tended to have stomach upset when ingesting calamus. So I made my way to some Chinese store and bought some ginger tea with cane sugar premixed in. That basically calmed my stomach alot. So I decided to go swimming at the local community pool. Well apparently when I got in the pool every thing started getting a little wierd in a good way. After ingesting that ginger tea I felt no nausea at all, but the calamus started kicking in pretty good. 



Well, let me tell you the Cree Indians were right about traveling great distances since I swam 45 laps (25 meters each lap) in the pool non stop. It just felt like I could go forever without stoping. When swimming I noticed I got some pretty wierd eye visuals under water while swimming. So in conclusion buy some Ginger tea and take it with calamus(gets rid of nausea). I would recommend taking it before exercsing to espicially if your going swimming
