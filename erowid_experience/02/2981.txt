I had been reading a lot about DXM online, and so decided to try it one night. After reading about many different drugs, I knew somewhat how to prepare myself.  



I made sure to have a good day, and not to fight with my parents.  I meditated shortly before the Simpsons, clearing my head, and decided that I had had an excellent day.  I believe that any and every high is half mental, and with the right attitude, I find that I can make the weakest high become as good as any. After watching the Simpsons (a very funny episode that put me in an even better mood), which ended at 8:00, I immediately consumed one and a quarter bottles of Robitussin Maximum Strength.  I retired to my bedroom to read `The Beach' and await the experience. 



At about 8:40, I started to feel a grass-like buzz, and decided I would stop reading and just lay on my bed.  I turned all my lights off, and layed still in the darkness.  On my stereo played The Doors.  Ironically, `the End', the trippiest song ever was playing as my trip began. It was 8:45 and my ceiling began turning different shades of black.  It would lighten, almost to white, and then go to gray and eventually to black again.  I put my hand up in front of my face and saw it light up, and then become engulfed in shadows.  I gathered my wits enough to call my friend Steven, who I asked to help me out with the experience.  Motion had a very special effect, and as I picked myself up to dial, I was shocked out how much I liked it.  From that point on, I was rolling in my bed almost the entire time. I talked to Steve for a while, telling him how I felt.  I lost my perception of time.  I told him I thought we had been talking for an hour, and in truth it was only ten minutes. At this point, 8:55, I noticed my door.  Around the outside of my door frame was a very bright light, like a fluorescent light.  It was continuous and traveled around the entire frame of my door.  In the middle of it was very dark.  It seemed my door had turned into a portal.  I looked into the portal, but it was too foggy to see, like a mixture of black and gray.  This intrigued me, but I got distracted by Steve, and a friend we had called on three-way.



It was then that I brought my attention back to my door.  The light around it had slightly diminished.  I wondered why, but as I gazed towards the portal, I understood.  In the middle was the blackest thing I had ever seen, similar to a black hole.  I quickly stopped rolling in my bed and stayed silent until Steven queried me. `Steve, my friend,' I said, `I'm staring into the infinite darkness.' I stared deep into the void, and everything around it disappeared.  It was intensely beautiful, and for a moment, nothing even existed aside from myself and the darkness.  I then saw two red eyes glowing at me.  I was horribly afraid, and decided to turn away.  I was sorry to do it, but it was more instinct then anything.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to reproduce the feeling quite as strongly as this one time. I started talking to Steve again, and we tried to call another friend, who unfortunately was not home.  We just sat and talked and laughed a bit.  I felt as if the phone had suddenly become huge.  The end in which I talked was so large that I could lay on it, and the handle had stretched enough to let me listen and talk at the same time.  I felt that everything in my room was a mile away, and I had suddenly shrunk.  This was highly pleasant.  It wasn't actually a hallucination, more like a strong day dream. It was about 10:20 when Steve and I hung up. 



My father called me downstairs to help me move a refrigerator.  When I got up to walk, I felt very drunk.  I stumbled in the darkness, and broke through the portal, out into the hallway.  I had been very afraid of going through the portal, but as I blindly stumbled, I slipped right through it.  I fell down a few stairs and started to giggle.  I got up, and found that by opening my eyes wide, I could walk straight for a little while.  I walked down and helped my father (the refrigerator was on wheels, so I had little trouble), and then went back upstairs.  I got into my bed for some introspection and meditation.  I got up, to see how well I could control my walking.  With concentration, I could walk straight for a full minute, as timed on my clock radio.  When I did not concentrate, I swaggered wildly.  And when I just let go of myself, I began bumping into walls and falling numerous times.  It was fun, but I didn't want my parents to see me.  I want back to my room and layed on my bed.  I fell asleep at about 11:30, as I was very tired from soccer earlier. I had some visions while I was asleep, of things that had happened previously.  



I was thinking of the infinite darkness when my mom woke me for school. I showered and had a cup of black coffee, which helped to wake me up.  I was very groggy, and if I let myself go, I even felt dizzy.  I got to the train station and smoked a strong unfiltered cigarette, which significantly cleared my head.  I felt much better, and could not wait to tell my friends of my night. My experience was highly enjoyable.  I went into it with a good mindset, and came away with a great experience.  The only aftereffect was my exhaustion, which gradually receded over the school day
