[21:00]

Ingests 2 pills Vitamin-C (500 mg. in each, selfdosing over 12 hours), 2 pills Vitamin-B6 (30 mg. in each) and 150 mg. 5-HTP.



[22:00]

Arrives at some friends, starts drinking booze and beers (there were plenty of alcohol).



[$\sim$22:30]

Starts eating of them pills. (3 Diamonds, an EZ-test first turned orange, then pitch black - definitly MDMA, and probably also amphetamine).



[$\sim$23:30]

Party's on, everybody is totally drunk, loud and most of us are drugged too.



[somewhere between 2 and 4]

We take off 8-10 persons to a new-years psytrance party.



[$\sim$45 mins. after]

Arrives at the party, i don't remember details but it ruled, and i danced my ass off.



[$\sim$5:45]

A girl gives me 2 blotters (Condoms, very good LSD!), after i give her 10 mg. foxy methoxy.



[$\sim$6:00]

My friend doesn't hesitate to eat the one, i eat 3/4 of my blotter, and give the last quarter to a friend. (I had eaten the 3 pills at that time).



[$\sim$6:45]

We can't feel if the acid has kicked in, because we are pretty MDMA-fucked, so we each eat a capsule of 10 mg. foxy methoxy (5-MeO-DiPT) to kick in the acid\ldots  It was about that time i ate another 150 mg. 5-HTP.



[$\sim$7:00]

I go to take a piss, and notice some minor visual distortions, 30 seconds after while i'm pissing, the visuals are accelerating, and from that point i have the most beautifull visuals i've ever had, definitly from the acid, but with a little of the foxy-visuals mixed in.



[$\sim$7:45]

I take off from the party with a couple of friends.



[$\sim$8:30-9:30]

We arrive 3 persons at my place, my MDMA-buzz is still present, but now clearly much more dominated by the hallucinogens.

I eat another 150 mg.'s of 5-HTP.



\ldots we trip, talk, listens to music, and enjoys each others great friendly company.



We order some food at about 8 pm., i go online to post something on a webboard, IRC's a little, logs off, and watches a movie with my friends.



Sleeps at about 11 pm.



Absolutely the best new years eve i had, a clear +++!

Great music, good friends, nice set \& setting, good drugs\ldots 



I've been told that the blotters (Condoms) are 185 mic. each, wich i believe is true. [Erowid note: Nobody really knows]



MDMA \& LSD is wonderfull together, and the little fox on top of it, is a great combination - absolutely recommendable!
