    It has been 3 weeks since I tried heroin for the first time.  I smoked it and had a less than enjoyable experience. My first shot of heroin was yesterday morning at 9:30 am.  Here is my account:



    I went back down to the West Side of Salt Lake City a few days ago and scored a gram of smack (Mexican Black Tar Heroin.)  Scoring here is unbelievably easy.  All I have to do is walk down the Rio Grande and within seconds I have dealers hooking up with me.  The score was made and I proceded home to store the goods.  I waited a few days until I was sure I had a day where nothing was needed to be done (my last heroin experience left me vomiting all day.)  I went to a local pharmacy and scored some syringes, 100 Unit 1CC 28 guage ultra fine.  



At 9:30 in the morning yesterday I cooked the shit in the torn-off bottom of a sprite can.  I used about 100 Units of water and one tic-tac sized ball of scag (about .25 gram).  The shit melted cleanly into the water when I held it above the candle.  A tic-tac sized ball of cotton from a Q-tip was inserted for a filter into the mixture.  I dipped the needle into the cotton ball and sucked-up all the heroin mixture.  I diluted it quite well, so I was left with about 70 units of smack in the syringe.  



My veins are quite deep so I knew this part was going to be difficult for me.  The only veins that I have that portrude well at all are in my hands and feet.  After trying for 5 minutes or so to pull-up the veins in my arms, I blindly tried to insert into a vein in the bend of my arm.  Once I thought I might have it in, I slowly injected 20 units of the shit into my arm.  I felt nothing.  The only possible explanation for this was that I missed the vein and was merely skin-popping.  The whole point of my experimentation with this drug is to find the rush that is so greatly sought by junkies, so I pulled the syringe out and proceeded to search my body for a good vein.  I noticed that the veins on my feet stuck out well, and would give me the freedom of using both hands to work with.  



I cleaned my left foot and slowly proceeded to insert the needle into my vein.  As I did this, and once I thought I had it in correctly, I slowly pulled back on the plunger.  A slow, dark trickle of blood filled the syringe and mixed with the smack.  It made a beautifully colored mixture with the heroin that reminded me of the wonderful sunsets here in the Salt Lake Valley.  Cool, I shoot Salt Lake sunsets into my veins.  I slowly pushed on the plunger and shot the contents of the 50 remaining units into my vein.  As I did this, a quick rush of warm dizziness filled my being.  How do I describe this?  Its so difficult to describe to those who have not experienced it.  Many describe it in terms of an orgasm ('Take the best orgasm, multiply it by 1000, and its still nowhere near it' -Trainspotting)  I believe an orgasm is completely different.  An orgasm comes quickly, builds quickly, and leaves quickly.  The heroin injection rush I received came quickly, engulfed my whole being, and it stayed and got stronger and stronger.  It made me fall back onto my bed.  I imagined I was falling from the sky and landing on a pile of millions of feathers.  



My extemities felt heavy and warm.  My torso and groin area felt warm and like it was a giant effort to move myself.  After about 20 minutes of laying there in this euforia, I lifted myself off the bed and proceeded to clean the evidence of my drug-use by taking it to the dumpster and disposing of it.  As I walked, I was reminded of the strong opiate buzzes I have had with Hydrocodone and Oxycodone, but nowhere near this.  I mean those buzzes were like 1 beer compared to the 10 beer buzz of heroin.  Anyway, the flawlessness of this drug soon dissappeared.



After about an hour of total euphoria, the naseau set-in, which I can deal with.  It was a factor in my smoking experience, so I knew it would be with shooting.  I threw up, then laid down and watched TV and listened to the radio.  As long as I was prone, the naseau wasn't there, but as soon as I stood up and walked around, I barfed.  So I lain in bed until 2:00pm, just nodding.  Sounds were greatly amplified and things caught by the corner of my eyes were flowing slowly, sort of like a hallucination but not really.  I was just basically very fucked up on some very good black tar.  



I remained high with the naseau until about 5 pm, but once the high was gone, I was stuck with a terrible case of the vomits.  As long as I was standing up, I was puking madly.  In other words, Heroin is a recreational drug only intended to be used by those who don't mind throwing their guts up for about 5 hours after the high (since while I was high I didn't give a flying fuck about throwing up since I felt so good.)  The come down from smack is pretty tough.  It has been about 30 hours since I mainlined it, and I have only felt normal now about the last 10 hours.  But oh my gosh, that first hour was unreal.  A whole new world.  All care and trouble goes out of my being just as soon as that needle plunger comes down.  It was intense.  



I promised myself I would only shoot until I run out of the .75 grams I have left, and I plan to stick to that vow because I could definately not afford to be a junkie financially or mentally.  After I shoot the rest of my stash, that will be all she wrote for me and heroin.  I am glad I tried it though, I gained a perspective that only those who have used it can have.
