Kratom, like opiates and opioids, is all about finding the right dose for the person.  I have had two separate experiences with the Kratom Super Powder.  The recommended dose on the site I purchased it from, and the dose guide, is somewhere around 4-6g for a strong experience.  In the past, I've found myself to be pretty tolerant of opioids, and usually end up popping a liver damaging dose of Vicodin to get a worthwhile high.  So I went for the high end, and swallowed 8g of Kratom powder mixed with lemonade.  It went down fairly easy, although the powder pretty much floated on the top.  I still would prefer this to sipping on tea. The powder texture was unpleasant but the lemonade washed it right down.  



I had no nausea, and felt a warm comforting sensation within a half an hour.  I reached the peak at an hour, which was quite pleasant and proved to be excellent in a social situation.  I felt extremely content and happy to be around friends, which for me is very unusual even with all the anti-anxiety medication.  The effects lasted another hour before I could sense it tapering off.  At 3 hours past ingestion I was baseline.  Sleep came easily, and other than a little grogginess there were no hangover effects the next morning.



I plan to use Kratom again very soon, increasing the dose to about 8-10g.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes using painkillers recreationally.  There are definite euphoric/sedating effects, and the hangover is minimal to non-existent.
