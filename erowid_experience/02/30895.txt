I ordered the woodrose seeds from the internet and received 10 from azarius. On friday-evening I decided to take 8. I grinded them and soaked them in water for 1 1/2 hour\ldots  and then I drunk the acid\ldots (6:30pm). Rather quickly I started to feel the effects\ldots  My hart seemed to beat faster and faster and I felt terrible cold. About 8:30pm I started to be very anxious about my health\ldots  I thought my heart-rate would kill me. I called anti-poison-centre who calmed me but adviced me to let check my heart-rate by doctor or hospital. I called a doctor at service. To my surprize he wasnt very helpfull at all. He didnt know the substance he said but he would come and pass by\ldots  I was having visuals now (moving shadows and disturbance of lines).. The doctor still wasnt there and I got even more anxious\ldots  I went out and went to emergency - I even took my gsm with me in case I passed out and could dial 911- \ldots  



10:00pm I am in front of emergency but I hesitate to go in because my job is related to the hospital. And I thought if in go my collegues and boss will know later about my bad habits \ldots  So I doubted - Sit there at entrance \ldots  Which seemed the best - because if a dropped dead there they find me quickly (I already had dialed 911 on my gsm now)\ldots  anxiousness increased and I was measureing out `do you want to live or do you want to die?' The rest of my life seemed to interesting and promising after all. The shame of being know as a druggie was worth to live on - even if I would lose my job - and I went in. The paramedics werent very friendly\ldots  then a doctor came\ldots  I was very ashamed. She took me heartbate and blood-pressure. It was ok she said. My heart would not collapse. That moment I was so fulled of joy that I embraced the doctor. I was very glad I was not going to waste\ldots 



She said I was having a severe panic-attack and gave me some diazepam to calm down. I cannot describe in words the joy I felt! I thanked the doctor\ldots  being ashamed and went home joyfully\ldots  hour before I thought going to die and now I could live further on\ldots  I was very very glad I had this experience. I definitely chosen live now. No more drugs. I was so glad that I lived on that possible consequences on my job seemed only details. I will change my lifestyle now.  This experience changed my life.
