Originally published at: http://s\_croll.tripod.com/crackcure/id1-2.html



I had to improvise a Psycotronic facilitator or Shock Box (the Black Box method of quiting Drugs),employing a dimmer switch, an Electrical cord, Electrial tape, and highly absorbent diasprum like cotton.



My pipe was new and I used 151 proof Puerto Rican Rum so it wouldn't darken the pipe and obscure the Smoke (so that I could create a trama at the mear sight of the Smoke going threw the pipe).



To keep my hands free I used cotton and a candel but if I had usually used a lighter then I would have used that .



To fashion the device I first took and cut the female end of the Electric cord and split it in two, forming a `Y' The ends being about ten inches long.



Next I stripped the plastic ends off (one about 4 and a half inches and the second just under an inch).



Third; I hooked the Dimmer Switch and the shorter exposed wire up by twisting and taping them together (The shorter exposed end to the Dimmer Switch).



Fourth;I proceeded to bend the other end of the longer exposed wire back upon itself (pic3) and tweak it in to a hangmans noose to fit just the tip of my finger at the point where my cuticle extends. Then I placed the noose over the nail and finger print area of my trigger finger; not letting the exposed part go past the crease where my palm starts(pic 3).



Fifth;I cut a small amount of the highly absorbent material and placed this up under the twisted part of the noose (using a tiny amount,about as much as on a Q-tip (pic 2\& 3), adding just a dab of water for  better conductivity.



Six;I taped the wire only to my trigger finger.



Seven;I finished taping the wire from the nuckel part of my finger to my nail, wringing out the excess moisture by tugging lightly on the black Electrical tape as I spiraled it down to my nail completeley covering the end (this was very important to preserve just the right moisture. 
 
Eight;I made sure that the Dimmer Switch was all the way down and off before I plugged it in. 



Nine; Trepidation was an integral part of the process(see tunnel vision page),so I focused on my Smokes.



Preemptive;(I was a Nicotin laced Tabacco'Addict' and I had to start a general aversion to Smoke foremost) taking my smokes all out of the pack at this point and then plugging the cord into the socket, and as I did focusing to the point of fixation on the smell and look of the fresh Cigarettes,reading the words on them or the pack or beer bottle.
