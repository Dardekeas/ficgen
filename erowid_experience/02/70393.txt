Surfing thru my medicine cabinet, I came across a bottle of Namenda, which was used by my grandmother who has Alzheimer's.



I decided to find out what this stuff was, so after looking it up on Wikipedia, I learned much.



Apparently, it is not only an NMDA antagonist, but an uncompetitive antagonist at different nicotinic neuronal receptors, as well as a 5ht3 receptor antagonist.  Having had much experience with DXM, I was curious to see how similar it was to my favorite drug of choice, and since the doctors took my Gram Gram of these meds, what else could I do?



I started by taking one of the 10mg tablets, which did not seem to do much, nor did I expect it to.



The next time I tried it I took 30mg, and definitely noticed something there, a sort of speedy, euphoric feeling.



Then the pills sat in the cupboard for a few weeks, and I mostly forgot about them.

Today, however, after being bored for several hours, I remembered that I had them, so 

I reread all of the old wiki information, and decided to try it again.



This time I took 40mg, which did not seem to do anything for about an hour, after which I started to gradually feel its effects coming on.



It has been several hours now, and I definitely would say that there is something here, in fact, it is great!



I would compare it to a cross between DXM and MDMA, without any jaw clenching, yuckiness.



I would also note, that after taking DXM for about a year straight, five days a week, in doses of about 150 to 200 milligrams, I became somewhat hypersensitive to it, whereas most sources say it is active around 150mg I was now getting my euphoric feelings off of just 75mg. This may mean I am also hypersensitive to this NMDA antagonist.



I was actually very addicted to DXM and continued taking it- every other day for weeks at a time, and quitting for several weeks, then back to it, and so on- for about two more years.



As of these experiments with memantine, I have not been using DXM for about six months, but I would still assume that my sensitivity is an issue, because after stopping DXM use for over a month, I would still be able to get high off of five robogels=75mg.



Anyhow, I am definitely very interested in this medication, and as there are 56 pills left, I will continue experimenting with larger doses.
