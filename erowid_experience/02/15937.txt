I currently take 50 mg of atenolol each day to control periodic heart palpitations which I have experienced for about 10 years.  I began taking atenolol about one year ago. I use MDMA about twice a year, but have not had the courage to try it since beginning atenolol.  My fear was that the two might be a deadly combination. I tried in vain to find any hard data about the combination of MDMA and atenolol.  Last week, after deciding to go ahead and not worry about it, I took two hits of MDMA at an all night outdoors party over the course of four hours.  While I did not expect to drop dead from the combination, I did think I might suffer increased palpitations or anxiety.  To my surprise, neither was the case.  My `trip' was about as normal as ever although not quite as intense as times before.  This could of course could have been due to weak MDMA.  I do not know. In fact, the next day, I felt better than ever, with no hangover of any kind. I am sure that the combination of atentolol and MDMA was not a wise decision, but I wanted to share my experience all the same.
