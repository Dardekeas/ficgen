 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:ACETAMINOPHEN\#\#  



Well about a month ago a friend and I came across 20 - 5/500mg Watson(Generic Vicodin) tabs. We planned on selling them but that night we got bored. 



9:30 - Get off work and head over to C's house. His parents are gone for the weekend. His uncle J is there.



9:35 - 5mg down. Wash it down with some Vodka.



9:45 - Read online that 5mg won't do a thing. Take 10mg more. Start to feel a bit `floaty'.



9:55 - Happy as shit and we take 10mg more. I feel like superman and a warm blanket wrapped together.



10:05 - Still happy and very talkative. We pop in a movie and keep talking.



10:30 - Keeps going up and finish it off with 15mg more. 



10:30$\sim$1:30 - This is where I lose track of time. Basically I'm happy and floaty as shit. Us 3 just sit on the couch and talk for 3 hours straight about everything. I can't remember the specific topics but we talk like crazy and it's sooo fun.



Sleep - Almost the best part is the sleep. Its the best night of sleep in my life.



Summary: This is, to date, the funnest trip I have ever had. Just talked about life for 3 hours and it was awesome. I felt great all night. The others felt `itchy' about an hour into it and said they felt it all night. I take Allegra(anti-histamine) so no worries. And right at the end of the trip both of them threw up, probobly cuz of the Vodka but I'm not sure. The only downside is that I can tell this drug is very addictive.
