I have taken Siberian, African, Europeon, Washington state, etc. A. muscaria 15-20 times in the past. I always oven dry them at 200 degrees, turning the oven off after temp. is reached, to cracker crispness. My dose is 13-16 grams. 



I have been collecting them in southern New Jersey for the last 10 days and have drying them in a food dehydrater until they reach cracker crispness.  I have tested them at doses between 6 to 10 grams three times and have found them to be extremely psychoactive,and increasing in intensity as dosage is increased.  These local shrooms are easily five times stronger than any others that I have used in the past and am still using.  15 min. after taking the doses on an empty or semi-empty stomach intoxication starts. Somewhat like an alcohol feeling.   I usually doze off about an hour later for 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Upon waking I have a feeling of heaviness and incoordination. Very pleasant.



At doses of 8-10 grams,in dim to dark rooms,I get beautiful yellow-green geometric patterns. This lasts for about 2 to 3 hours before turning into red web-like visuals that may or may not undulate or wave. After a total around I fall asleep. South Jersey A. muscaria are by far the strongest and most active of  A. muscaria that I have used from any other source or location.



This experience is different and has different visuals than psilocybin mushrooms.
