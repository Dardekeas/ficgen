I had a day off in the middle of the week and had nothing to do, so I hit up the internet to see if I had anything to spice up my midday. I searched my medicine cabinet to find that my wife had grabbed 40 mg of her brothers Ritalin (this must have been 5 years ago because the bottle said to take by 2002). After reviewing the experiences I decided the pros outweigh the cons. All doses are insufflated.



Took 2 10mg pills:



Nothing happened in the timeframe some reports stated (5-10 minutes, should feel the rush) so I looked online to see what the shelf life was, 2 YEARS! I was bummed thinking I had just snorted an unpleasant tasting substance for not. But as I was in the middle of my internet search on the shelf life, it hit me. It was sudden, and heavy but not overbearing. I continued my search on the diminishing effects of aged Ritalin. The effects were good, similar to coke like a lot of experiences stated. Good rush, energy and euphoria. I decide to take the last 20 mg. I would have saved the rest for my wife but she is pregnant so I didn't feel bad binging. 



Took second 2 10mg dose, 15 minutes after initial dose.



I am writing this as the second wave hits. It is good but not as strong as I hoped. It seems to come in waves though so I am not done yet. 



All in all a good high. Nothing too special but a nice bump in the middle of the day.
