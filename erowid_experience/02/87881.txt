 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#   It was very much a `heady' high. Pressure in the eyes and such. Slight euphoria. I continued doing lines/bumps when I started feeling a come down. Now I must tell you all that I did this without researching the chemical or knowing proper doseage $>$.$<$! The night moved on from there.



After about 2-3 hours of indulging in what I thought at first was an amazing thing I decided to take a drive. The lights in the street were very bright and there were sunbursts from every source of light. My eyes became enraged and I quickly went home. I knew then that I shouldn't do more but did anyhow. I spent the whole night up peaking out of windows.



The next day I had off of work and the MDVP just kept coming. Come morning I was still awake, very paranoid, and I believe I was seeing and hearing things. My apartment didn't feel like my apartment any longer. In fact it felt like I was in an entirely different world only backwards or `bizarro' like on Seinfeld. Gratz if you get the reference :p \ldots  anyhow throughout the day I swear to you I could hear my neighbors having sex next door. I truly believe this was happening. Two car loads of guys were going in and out and this carried on for hours and into the night. I remember texting my girlfriend explaining that the people next door were having an orgy and I felt like calling the police so I didn't have to listen.



When I sent the text I heard very loud sex noises outside my window and so I took a peek. There were lights on in the back yard of the neighbors behind and I saw a man walking towards a shed in towards some shadows (kinda looked like a cop.) The noises continued and I heard some hollering. By this time I had moved my bedding into the living room to avoid the noises. Soon after the noises stopped. All of the cars that were there left except one. I decided it was ok to return to my room. As soon as I lay down I heard a shower kick on and sex through the walls! This was short lived and then the last car left. Hallucinations? Who knows.



I also witnessed my coffee table float up about 6 inches. I felt like a jedi. I wasn't sure if it was really moving so I held my foot still and it still moved up. When I looked at its legs they were still on the ground\ldots  weird.



All of this was followed by extreme bad mood\ldots  severe depression\ldots  eye inflammation which caused `flashing blue lights' look it up\ldots  and extreme red eye among other things.



All together around 500-550mg in a 2 night binge not a good idea.



Proceed with great warning and respect everything you try by being educated first. Psychosis is not fun!
