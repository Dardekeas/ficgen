It was during my year 12 exams, and I had started to use opiates more and more regularly most nights, in the form of oxycodone, because they helped me to study.



I had previously tried dexamphetamine, but disliked it for two reasons, it is very hard for me to get hold of, and as a consequence, because I can't take it regularly, I constantly crash the following day and am unable to study. Additionally, it seemed to make me very depressed and I grew a tolerance to it very quickly. For this reason, opiates seemed the study aid of choice for me. 



I had an exam the next day for which I had learnt nothing (an `options' exam, so it would probably take 6 hours of solid study to learn the required material.) Unfortunately, my supply of oxycodone 20mg ran out, so I decided to go to the chemist to purchase some tablets of acetaminophen 500mg and codeine 8mg. I then performed rushed and poor cold water extraction on 8 of the tablets, which would give a theoretical yield of 96mg, but was probably more like 80mg, and ingested the resulting liquid. [Erowid Note: A theoretical yield would be 64mg, not 96mg.]



Unfortunately, codeine seemed to have a poor effect on me in comparison to oxycodone. I have had this effect with morphine too, it seems that the morphine molecule does not fair well with my opioid receptors. I get little euphoria, while still retaining the constipative and anxiolytic properties. Worst of all, I get extreme nausea, which made me very uncomfortable and virtually unable to study, of course, this defeated the purpose of taking the opiate. I had previously thought that these symptoms were owing to an `expired batch' of morphine, but now I have concluded that oxycodone must activate the opioid receptors in a different fashion to the morphine molecule (which is the active metabolite of codeine).



Anyway, because of this horrible nausea, I made the stupid decision of taking some naltrexone (a potent opiate antagonist), that was in the medicine cupboard for some reason. I had fooled myself into believing that I had no form of dependence, so I thought that taking the naltrexone would only have the effect of relieving my nausea, so I could try and study without the opiates. Unfortunately, this was not the case, I'm not sure what dosage of naltrexone that I took, because the tablets said `R 11' on one side, and `5 | 0' on the other. I'm not sure if this indicated that they were 5mg or 50mg, but I digress. After about 10 minutes of ingestion of the naltrexone tablet, I felt fine and sober, as I did when I had not taken the codeine. Unfortunately, it did not stay this way, and another 30 minutes later I started to have an extreme aversion to light and become very anxious. Suddenly I felt an extreme desire to vomit, and I was sweating profusely. Coupled wth the fact that I knew that I had a large amount of material to learn before 7am, this threw me into an extremely uncomfortable panic attack, and I actually felt like I wanted to die.



My first instinct in this situation was to try to hold down some benzodiazepines to surpress these adverse reactions. I took 3 10mg temazepam tablets, because they were all that I had, the hardest part of this experience was trying to hold them down until they were absorbed, without vomiting. I knew that I would have no possibility of studying in my present state, so I set the alarm for 5.30am (somehow) and managed to crawl into bed feeling like I wanted to die. After about 20 minutes I felt the temazepam tablets set in, because I have virtually no tolerance for benzodiazepines, and the anxiety was alleviated. Additionally, I was very zoned out, and whilst I still felt uncomfortable, it didn't seem to matter as much. The night's sleep was extremely restless and intermittent, but not necessarily unpleasant. When i woke up at 5.30, I still had a horrible headache and was very tired, but most of the other symptoms had subsided. Somehow, I was able to read the textbook in time for the exam, and went and aced it. Finishing that exam was the biggest relief of my life, and I went home and slept for a number of hours. 



I'm not sure why I had such an extremely intense withdrawal experience caused by the naltrexone - I'm thinking that either I had built up a solid dependence on opiates, or that it was because all of the receptors were suddenly deactivated instantly, rather than gradually in the normal manner, causing some form of `rapid detox.' Either way, it was horrible, and I am amazed that I survived through that exam. My thinking now is to never take an opiate antagonist while I am high on opioids! That was one of the most horrible experiences that I have ever endured (although it was probably worsened by the fact that I had an imminent exam). I was very lucky to have a happy ending.
