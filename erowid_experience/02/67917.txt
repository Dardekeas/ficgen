Ahhhhhh! So, the time has become, the time for the straight and narrow. I've had a 12 year drug habit and it is time I kicked it, after being sucked in by GBL binges\ldots  Recreationally of course ;). I joined or registered within a group called addaction. After necking my way through litres of GBL since March (which my habit became more so in past moons) my life turned into a complete arse. First of all, I lost one job, then my driving license, then a second job, then a second arrest\ldots .all on GBL and all through GBL. So, this is why I have decided its time for counseling and the `straight and narrow'. 



For the past three weeks I have been taking GBL 24/7 [125ml per 3-5 days, concentration not specified], to withdraw is to go into DT mode; shakes, paranoia, anxiety ETC (typical come down syndrome), the withdrawal to this evil shit has been compared to heroin. I aint on here to act big by speaking about this; this is for me.



So, I'm a fuckin coward, I want off this shite\ldots .I'm off it now. 



First of all I arranged a doctor's appointment, 10 Zopiclone ordered! Or demanded. Then I bought myself 2 litres of whisky and a 8th of green.



Saturday, 12pm. I had approx 100ml of GBL left in a bottle. I measured one huge dose, 4mls, enough for one more trip into a GBL coma. Then in a ritual type way, I poured the rest down the sink, cursing the fuckin stuff. I necked my dose\ldots ..and off to noddy land for one more meeting with the chemical devil. I awoke from my coma around 3pm, I feel euphoric, liquid ecstacy.



It's now 5pm, the dose has gone and the tremors and shakes and clasps of thunder in my ears awakes me into normality. Here it comes, I'm a coward, so I reach for the zopiclone, 3, a quick bong and a large measure of whisky. BANG. I'm out.



BANG\ldots .BANG\ldots .BANG\ldots ..it's the door, my neighbour's having a heart attack\ldots .the only thing I could mutter was \ldots ..he'll be alright. What an arsehole I feel. But fuck me I could not even walk. BANG,three more Zop's some more whisky\ldots \ldots 



It's now sunday afternoon, my mother's dog lays faithfully, caringly by my side, it's like he knows what's going on\ldots ..god he does know. I kiss him, he licks me with affection as I eat the rest of the zops\ldots .my greeen has all gone\ldots .has the dog ate my stash?!?! I can't remember smoking it! I have 1 litre of whisky left\ldots \ldots BANG I'm out.



Monday\ldots 11pm. My mum walks in. She panics bless her, but she knows the score with my addiction problems. I said to my caring mother `I know I'm a mess, but this is me getting better, I'm off the GBL'. She cried her heart out hugged me and thanked the lord. I am off it, but cowardly it took me lots of other narcotics to bide my time.



Tuesday\ldots ..spent most of the day shaking, DT mode.



Wednesday\ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots .I started talking to ghosts



Thursday chanting in my ears, monsters after me



Heres a warning, dont cane it. It really isnt worth it.
