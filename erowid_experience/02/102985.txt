WOOW! Everything is smooth, so let's start from the beginning, I am a person with Bipolar Disorder and I tend to try every drug that falls on my hands, often injecting it.

After over 2 moths sober of everything, I started to inject myself with pure saline just cos I like injecting shit in myself, I know, this is not accurate but I shall say it.

Today I got 100mg of 3 meo pcp it's not my first time on this thing but lately I've been injecting nearly anything, so I decided to inject it IV. Suddenly everything is smooth and I mean like really smooth as if the world had been covered with some sort of warm lotion.

Everything I touch feels smooth and warm and sometimes even slippery. My skin feels as if it was about to fall from my body painlessly, all pain I used to have in my sore muscles have dissipated now. I am painlessly laying on a couch ironically listening to `Smooth' by Santana/ Rob Thomas. And everything seems fine. 

I don't have much to say, but one ting, I've tried heroin to get rid of pain but this is different: it doesn't change pain into pleasure but it does make the pain go away as you trip on an infinite silk world. Nothing hurts in me but I feel warm and fuzzy it's just so weird. XDD, idk if you like these shot of feelings go for it !
