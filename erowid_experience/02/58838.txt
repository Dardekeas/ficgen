Well, I raided a bunch of tramadol and endocet from a friend's parents cabinet. In any case, I was bored earlier the other day so I decided to try and get a little f'ed up, just a little afternoon fun.



Anyway, I took two 50mg Tramadol, then waited about 30 minutes.



I started to feel `softer' and then started to feel a little Jelly-like, a little euphoric and then a little tired. I decided I needed to feel some more so I took half of one of the Endocets I have.



Waited 30 minutes or so. Started to feel more painkillery, but still not that much. So I took another Endocet.



Hour later. It hits me, a lot, I'm wavy but pretty clear. I feel great all over and feel the strong sense of swimming through the world that I get from a huge PK dose. Then I'm around and fine for a while, hangin out watching High Fidelity and feeling pretty crazy all over. Then, comes the feeling that I don't really understand\ldots  my entire body feels like it's itchy, from head to toe, and I can't stop scratching myself. This goes on for about 4 hours of me just about crying from how itchy I feel, I take some shots and get too fucked up to know what's going on and just pass out.



But let me tell you.. I'm not going to f around with painkillers anymore, because that itchy feeling is just too much.
