This experience happened in the company of two others, who I will refer to as A and B. All three of us have some experience with tryptamines and psychedelics, especially mushrooms. With first-hand reports from a handful of other friends who had taken the same blotters, we knew more or less what to expect and felt prepared to try this relatively new research chem.



We got our sheet of blotters from a friend to whom they were sold as acid. He immediately discovered this not to be the case upon taking some himself. He spoke to the person who sold it to him and she informed him that it was in fact 25I-NBOMe. Though disappointed it was not acid, we decided that since we may never again see this chem again, we ought to take advantage of it and try it.



The day we decided to take it I wasn't feeling particularly well emotionally. I had some strong anxiety partially tied to trying something new (especially something as unproven and novel as 25I), but which was also due to a lack of sleep and a stressful week at work. For this reason as well as not knowing the exact dosage of each blotter, A and I decided to only take a half-blotter each. B chose not to take any, as he had a few other things he needed to do that evening and was more comfortable being our sitter. We cut one in half with a knife and each held our half-blotters behind our bottom lips, against the gums for about 45 minutes. I then transferred mine to under my tongue for another 15 before swallowing it, while A discovered when she tried to do the same that she had accidentally swallowed it at some point during the previous 45 minutes.



I felt a very small `speedy' rush building for the first ten minutes after having tucked the paper into my lip, but this quickly plateaued and became subliminal. Speaking to other members of the household was easy and flowed as usual --- there was little difficulty finding words like with some other psychedelics. After about 45 minutes we withdrew to the bed, where A and I curled up under the covers since we were both feeling quite cold.



For about an hour after this point (from T+0:45 to T+1:45 or so) thermoregulation was our biggest priority. This wasn't particularly tough in bed with blankets and another warm body nearby, but I could imagine being out and about during this stage could be very uncomfortable.



The visuals of 25I are unlike the fractals one might expect from typical psychedelics. A described seeing finer detail shivering `as if it had been animated by hand with a pencil, and every frame was just slightly mis-aligned'. I experienced visual distortions mostly in my periphery, with objects seeming to buckle and warp slightly as I moved my eyes over them.



Tactile sensation was definitely augmented. At around T+1:00 I got the feeling that I did not want to lie still, and shifting slowly around in bed felt great with the soft blanket against my skin. Until about T+1:30 or so, we did not notice any real mood lift, though it did come. Jokes became funnier, people warmer, and ideas more interesting. 



Around this time, B returned and brought a bit of food, which we ate slowly. A and I knew we were hungry, but I especially was feeling slightly nauseous, and the slight stimulation of the 25I was enough to suppress appetite despite a feeling in my stomach that told me I ought to eat. I realized at this point I had been sweating a fair amount and was thirsty. Throughout the trip the both of us probably drank a bit less than a litre of water each. 



At around T+2:30 A started to feel sad and spent some time pondering big problems with the world. I tried for a while to cheer her up or at least distract her, but she did not much seem to want me to. She told me later that it was the `first time in a while [she] had really felt moved by anything' and that she hadn't much wanted to let go of such a strong emotion, even a sad one.



At around T+3:30 or 4 the proper `high' had worn off: our euphoria and amplified emotion had mostly dissipated, and the visuals and enhanced tactile sensation were muted, though still present. As it wore off I felt quite tired, but this passed. My appetite returned and I ate what food was left, then went to get more from the kitchen. I felt much more capable than I had a couple hours prior, but my motor control was definitely still impaired and I moved slowly and deliberately to avoid knocking things over or dropping things.



I remarked later on in the night that I believed I could easily handle a full blotter next time: though the come-up came with uncomfortable nausea and shivers, the peak high was not overwhelming in sensation or emotion, and during the longer-lasting residual trip I found myself wishing it were a little stronger. 



At around T+6:30 we all started to feel sleepy and I was getting a headache, so we went to bed. A and I did not find it easy to fall asleep however, and ended up staying up to have sex for an hour or so before trying to go to sleep again. It's worth noting 25I made us both feel aroused throughout the trip. By this point I was tired enough to fall asleep without too much issue, but A's imagination was still overactive and keeping her awake. She also experienced some discomfort in her joints when she lay still too long. We did fall asleep eventually though.



The next morning we slept in, and did not feel any residual effects. A friend reported that after taking two blotters he was feeling some effects even 16 hours later.



In conclusion, 25I is an interesting chemical and was worth our time. Though uncomfortable at first, it was generally pleasant and provided some interesting changes to perception and imagination. I am looking forward to trying larger doses in the future.
