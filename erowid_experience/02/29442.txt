The day started with me waking early and eager to find some way to get downtown. Then I called my friend C and wanted to go downtown 2, so after 5 mins of mindless rambling C decided we should take the bus somewhere. We took the bus, got to the mall shopped for mom and dad while C mostly shopped for his younger brother, after that we went back home by a ride from my dad. C and J came over and we cracked open some cold vodka. We drank about 7 shots then smoked some joints and took some mad bong hits. J didn't do any drugs he is straight edge and doesn't do them, don't change the guy he just don't like to get high. After that we obtained some triazolam and clonidine off a friend J knew for \$2.After that I went to my house and sniffed all those downers to my head. 



As the full effects kicked in I laid down and rested. I felt very strong wind like effects, that seemed the trough of my center of balance as my arms started to warm up like a heating pad I'd often get nauseating rushes, I never puked but still to close for comfort. I also couldn't walk worth shit, my walking was poor. I had blurry vision. My thoughts were always calm and peaceful.
