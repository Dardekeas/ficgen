3pm, I insufflate 15mg morphine and 30mg amphetamine to help pass the time while we wait for everyone to show up to our little house party.



Skip ahead to 10pm, everyone has arrived.  I take 2 pills orally, which, looking back, I'd say its highly possible they were methylone [there really wasnt an mdxa-like headspace to it, but all my senses were definately enhanced, and everyone who took them said that the pills were weak; exactly what I'd expect from methylone, although I still haven't knowingly tried methylone, so I can't say for sure; and out my past mdxa+2cb trips (3 mda+2cb, 2 mdma+2cb, and 1 mda+mdma+2cb), I've never experienced anything even remotely similar to what I felt this night], but they also could've just been mdma, I'll never know for sure.



12am. The effects are comming on really slow and weak, so I take half a pill orally and absorb the other half sublingually (total of 3 pills so far).



My friend mentions that he wants to go get some ass, so we head off to the strip club.  We enjoy the strippers for awhile and he tells me we need to come back before 3; score!



$\sim$12:30am Finally the effects are really starting to kick in.  Enhanced sense of touch, jaw chattering like crazy, and dialated pupils.  We leave the club and head back to the house.



When we get back, I stay in the kitchen to chat with another friend, who's birthday was the previous day.  He tells me he's gotta head home in a few hours so I go ahead and give him his present - 20mg of 2cb.  We chat for awhile about how e-tarded the rest of our friends are, with their glowsticks, kandy bracelets, and pacifiers.  We say that they should've grown out of this long ago, but it could just be cuz we're really jaded.



2am, we head out to give birthday boy a ride home, and everyone gets some 2cb.  Obviously our driver will wait to take his dose, but I promptly snort about 20mg.



2:45am, We get to birthday boy's house and drop him off.  By this time, the 2cb is really starting to kick in, and the best euphoria I've ever felt in my life begins to encompass me.  I crawl into the back seat and lie down, practically orgasming because of how good I'm feeling.  We return to the strip club to pick up the stripper who agreed to go home with us; we decide in my state, it is best I remain in the car, so my friend heads off to go inside.  He is gone for a minute, then returns, telling me that the doors are locked.  There goes that idea\ldots  We return to the house, empty handed.



Now around this time, I honestly can't remember much that actually happened.  I just remember the intense euphoria.  My visual field is really distorted and foggy, due to the 2cb `persian carpet overlay', and the orgasmic feeling takes up most of my focus.  I spend a large portion of the next hour just lying around, moaning and enjoying.  I do remember lying on the bed, chatting with my best friend and his girl.  He mentions the ketamine I brought along, so we head to the kitchen and dry out 1/2cc, and I promptly snort up half.  Not too interesting, I dont really notice much from it.  Somewhere around this time, I realize I'm too stimulated and tripping too hard to piss, so I have somebody mix me up a drink, to exploit alcohol's CNS Depressant/Diahretic properties so I can piss.  Unfortunately it didnt help any at the time.  We head back into the back room and chat some more, discussing life and relationships.  After about 15 minutes, (should be around 3:30-4am by now) I tell him what I'm gonna go do so that he knows whats going on.  I head into the bathroom and IM 50mg of ketamine. 



fast forward about 5-10 minutes. the ketamine hits.  I drop to the floor, as I suddenly obtain ego loss.  I can only remember bits and pieces of what happened.  I remember my visual field being expanded to where i can see at least 270 degrees around; I remember my visual field becomming skewered, seeing everthing tilted up, down, and angled to the side; I also remember seeing myself from outside my body, and at one point I saw my image multiplied.  It feels like hours that I'm in this state, and at one point I begin grasping for reality, to find something resembling baseline, so that I could have something to hold on to and anchor myself to reality. 



4:30am, enough of the ketamine wore off so that I could control my body again.  I can hardly interact with anyone else tho; my hearing is very distorted, echoing massively, and my vision is swamped by the `carpet' overlaying itself on everything in the darkness.  I sit down and get a massage from a friend.  Several times I go limp and almost `fall' out of my body again.  The euphoria from before is still present. 



eventually I head back into the back room to chat with my best friend again, and whoever else is back there.  By this time, we've got a semi-large group back there with us.  One person tells me that I scared the shit out of everyone earlier; apparantly I went totally limp and spasmed while I was out in k-land.  Nobody else there was really aware that ego loss was possible on psychedelics, but with k its very possible; nobody was prepared for me going down like I did, since I only informed 2 people before I IM'd the k.



4:30am, I snort the last 1/4 pill to try to maintain my euphoric state.



6am or so, a few of us head to my house on foot, a short journey of 6 blocks, to get some more 2cb.  I snort another 20mg and return completely to my euphoric state.  I notice that if I sort of nod off (my body is extremely tired by this point), the pleasure is increased, so I snort 15mg of morphine to encourage nodding off.  I lay some glow sticks over my eyes and trance out to a near-orgasm several times, but unfortunately shake myself out of it before getting too deep into it.



7am, my friend and his girl tell me they're leaving in an hour, and she gives me 10mg of valium to help me sleep, which I hang on to until later.  Also, I was finally able to piss about this time :)



11am, i get talked into doing more 2cb, so again we head back to my house and to get some.  I snort up yet another 20mg.  My vision begins `echoing' when it kicks in, leaving multiple images of everything as tracers, every time I shift my eyes.

 

The rest of the day is spent lounging around watching movies, my jaw still shaking, and I am still intensely euphoric. 



3:30pm, I decide to head home, where I promptly snort 2.5mg valium and pass out.
