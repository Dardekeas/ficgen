Hi there, this is my first trip report here, so I hope, it's useful for someone. I've got a lot more, if you like `em.



2C-C



setting: at home, after a quite demanding working day.

set: curious, no big expectations



T=0.00 1mg insufflated (allergy test) fine white sparkling powder, bitter and harsh chemical taste



T=0.28 5mg insufflated - burns like hell, I'm coughing. 



T=0.32 5mg insufflated - still burns, other side of nose.



T=0.35 5mg insufflated - palms begin to sweat, I'm feeling something undistinguishable coming slowly.



T=0.50 whoaaah :-) this feels very much like MDMA.  My throat does really ache. I have to rinse it with sea-salt nose spray. washing my face, water feels `sloshy'. optics are slow, peripheral vision is more colorful, draws things like chewing gum.



T=0.55 watching a short porno. this is too real. coming up was with a little body load, but not too demanding.



T=1.00 suddenly I have a great clarity in my head. now I'm there! :-)



T=1.05 sex - I realize, that I have to look at each moment individually, no purpose must influence my feeling. purpose and sensitivity don't fit together. I can watch myself and still feel the sensations. orgasm is incredible and sparkles colorful like `disco'. extremely smooth and warm and soft.



T=1.15 I'm feeling a little cold, I've to get a jacket, although it's 22Â°c. writing works astonishingly well. my fingers feel a little itchy.



T=1.17 my geometrical reception is very distorted. all lines and angles are bended. I feel comfortable, haven't been in such a state of mind for a very long time. it's a little bit like coming home (had a very psychedelic time back then).



T=1.18 have to burp from all that sparkling water. I'm afraid, if someone was here now, I'd have a big urge to talk to him/her quite a lot.



T=1.20 going outside and lay down in my sun-chair. the sky is dark-violet and has an unusual depth. the trees seem to bend into an additional dimension. I'm aware, that those visuals come from 2c-c. a friendly drug. I feel a bit broken-hearted, although my girlfriend will soon be back.



T=1.22 closing my eyes and listen to `cafe del mar'. music is very pleasant, with closed eyes I can see and feel the music a little, but just marginally. A higher dose will surely enhance those synesthetics.  time seems to run slower, although everything feels fast.



T=1.30 having a shower, the sensation of water is overwhelming, very euphoric feeling. 

badly, I feel, that I'm already over the plateau and the effects start to fade slowly.



T=1.50 I've more and more `everday thinking' in my head.



T=2.00 sex. the feeling is not such empathic as before, but still deeper, more directly. orgasm is very intensive, it literally sucks my balls. ;-)



T=2.15 eating a water melon. I'm not hungry, anyway I feel, how my body draws out the water and the nutrients.



T=2.20 drinking a magnesia/calcium drink and a multi-vitamine tablet, to prevent a bad coming down or hang-over.



T=2.25 watching national geographic channel. colors are still very intensive, hd looks like ultra-hd. the geometrical distortions are gone. moving around feels good.



T=2.30 light dragging pain in my head. still have that light-footed feeling of `swaying'



T=4.30 tired and somhow sedated



T=5.30 finding sleep is no problem



Next day:



no hang-over, light dragging pain in my head, but could also come from the air condition in the airplane (have been abroad today).



Summary:



great MDMA-like psychedelic, sex is intensive and `disco' like, very empathogenic, a bit sedadative. nice visuals (colors, morphing, `hi-res'), music is great, feeling of lightness, not much body load.
