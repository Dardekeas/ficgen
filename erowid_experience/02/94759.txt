Having experienced 2C-I and 2C-C, when my friend told me that I could pick up some 2C-T-2 from him, I was pretty excited. I drove over to his place and he weighed me out a 25mg dose of some beautiful white crystals. We hung out for a bit, and I went back to my place and took the pill at around 3:00 PM. I had read online that this compound has a tendency to cause nausea for a lot of people, so I brought a pan up to my room just in case. I normally don't purge on psychedelics, and luckily I didn't feel very nauseous at all, but the come up of any psychedelic is usually a little bit bothersome. At around 4:30 PM I was starting to feel some effects; minor visual distortions, objects looking like they are breathing, etc.



At around 4:35 I decided to smoke some cannabis just to make sure that I wouldn't get nauseous because I was feeling a weird sensation in my stomach. I was listening to a playlist consisting of Justice, Tool, Porcupine Tree, Led Zeppelin, Nero, and a lot of psychedelic trance. All of which was amazing music to trip to, especially Tool's 10,000 Days. At around the 5:30 mark I was fully peaking; I looked at my carpet and started busting up laughing because of the swimming fractals I was seeing. I also have a popcorn ceiling, which is amazing for psychedelic visuals, which is why my friends and I always choose to trip at my place. Looking up at the ceiling I was seeing amazing, snakelike patterns twisting and turning. The coolest thing was the smoke fractals that were created after exhaling cannabis smoke.



The smoke seemed to create multiple layers in my vision, all of which looked like two skeleton creatures coming forward to kiss each other. When I started peaking I got out my sketchbook to draw my usual trip picture. I was amazed at the crazy ideas I was coming up with. One interesting thing about this chemical was the feeling of a presence watching me. It was as if there was some sort of entity watching me, and I felt a cold sensation on my skin that continually freaked me out a little bit. Surprisingly though, this chemical was very clear headed.



I could hold up a conversation with my roommate just fine, even though the experience was going back and forth from a ++ to a +++ on Shulgin's scale. I came down by about 12PM, and had drawn a pretty amazing picture and was working on another one before I got a massive headache. I went to pour myself a cup of tea and pet my cat to try to make my headache go away but it didn't help too much. I had a hard time getting to bed, but when I finally did, I got a good night's sleep. I didn't feel much of an afterglow the next day, but luckily I wasn't too groggy.
