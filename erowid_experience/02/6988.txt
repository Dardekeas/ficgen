I had tried coke twice before w/ no effect, but I'll tell you about my third (and first successful) experience.  It was only last week actually.  Where I work, mostly people smoke weed, but I found out recently that coke was going around.  After being invited to try it the fist time and then getting some from a friend the second time, I thought that perhaps it just wasn't my drug of choice (pot btw).  A coworker started to sell it; so, I thought w/ it now being really close by, I would try again.  I bought a 20 bag and waited for a slow period.  When the others were taking a smoke break, I decided to take my break to the car.  



I emptied the bag and began to cut it.  Now I went against my normal smart advice and didn't do much research about coke.  I know a few people whose drug of choice is coke, but I stupidly didn't ask them too much.  So, I just separated it into two fat lines.  I rolled up a dollar and took them both in.  I never felt so good in my entire life!!  Nothing can really describe the feeling.  I pretty thought it was better than X except that it didn't last long enough.  I got a bit of nausea b/c I had taken waay too much.  It was wonderful.  Everything was brighter; people were warmer.  It was an empathic feeling.  I was told that I was moving around like a hummingbird for the most part talking a mile a minute.  



I would repeat the experience again and have done so.  I boght some more that evening, but I drew that out over a few days.  I love cocaine.  If I could afford it, I would do it more often.  Lucky for me, doing coke takes a backseat to paying the rent.  I worried about becoming addicted, but I have conciously limited myself to coke.  I limit myself to pot for the most part, but I would never deny myself the white.  One just has to do it sparingly.
