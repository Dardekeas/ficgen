Four Grams of Anadenanthera Colubrina Var. Cebil seeds were cooked in a toaster oven at 200 degrees for 15 minutes. Once cooled, the seed coats were removed and discarded. I placed the dark colored innards of the seeds in a coffee bean grinder and powdered to a very fine consistency. One gram of Calcium Oxide, obtained from a lab, was added to the snuff and mixed thoroughly. Three people agreed to insufflate the cebil. Each person consumed no more than 250mg of the snuff. Three sets of two lines of the snuff were arranged on a flat surface. A straw was cut into three pieces to be used as an aid for insufflation. 



There were strong burning sensations in my sinuses and the taste of cebil was in the back of my throat. Within one minute the effects began. A very heavy feeling was abundant throughout my body. It felt as though some force was pushing me against the ground. The pressure of the atmosphere became very weighted and forced me to lay down. Strong somatic sensations where accompanied by a strong head rush. My body temperature raised quickly and I began to sweat. After 10 minutes a disturbance in my vision occurred. The fluorescent lights of my small indoor garden began refracting single colored images around my room. The circular images were weak and not at all pronounced. After 15 minutes the strong rush subsided. Remnants of the somatic effects were felt throughout my body for the next hour. 



This was my two associates' first time experiencing Vilca. It took about two minutes for them to notice the effects. They complained of stomach pains thirty minutes after ingesting the snuff. They also experienced a rise in body temperature and strong somatic feelings. One of them described having a very visual experience. 



I imagine that with the use of a larger amount of this snuff stronger visual aspects would occur. As with any drug I start out with a low dosage and work my way up.
