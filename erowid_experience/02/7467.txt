Well it all started with a trip to Matamoros, Mexico. A little border town of Texas near Brownsville and Padre Island. I went down there to party and party is what I did. I came back with a shitload of xanax and valiums, and a bottle of Oxycontin. All week long I was taking more than the reccomended dosage of pills. Usually around 3 or 4 valiums and 2 xanax at night time before bed. Man did I sleep well!!! I usually woke up feeling better than the night before looking forward to the night time when I could dose up again. During the day I would usually take about 2 to 3 Oxycontin's. Which would help me get through the boring ass day.



I would be feeling pretty good, and then it would be night time once more and then I could take my usual dose of valiums and xanax along with my prescribed dose of 20 mg daily paxil. Well at the end of the week I decided to go overboard with it all and I really fucked up this time. It was saturday night and I was staying at my friends house cuz I was going to go to church with her the next day, well I didnt make it to church the next morning as planned. I overdosed on valiums and Xanax.



I had taken 9 valiums with 3 xanax, two oxycontins, and my paxil. Well that night my dad had said somthing to me that I didnt believe. He had told me that all week he had noticed that I was on something, but that he didn't know what. I had felt `normal' all week and for him to say something like that, well I didn't believe him so I continued on using until that night. All I remember was that I was kneeling down trying to say a prayer before bed and I kept nodding off. Until my friend just told me to go to bed. The next time I was able to talk was 3 days later after I awoke from my coma. 



My friend says that the next morning when she tried to wake me up that I was just unresponsive. She then saw that I had puked pink stuff all over myself and that I was making some kind of garggling noise like I was choking. She then called 911 and had me picked up at her house. I awoke from my coma about 3 days later to see all my family and friends gathered around me like it was my funeral. Seeing my mom crying was probably the hardest thing to see. The side effects were horrible as well, I noticed that I had trouble thinking of anything for long periods of time and I just seemed kind of spaced out. And all my short and long term memory had gone to shit.



I couldn't even remember parts of my trip to Mexico or other events that have happened in my life. It sucks. I used to be a very outgoing person able to liven any party and able to talk my way into or out of anything. Like jobs. Now it's been about 9 months since my accident and I still feel a little bit spaced out. Definitely better than I used to be but still not 100\% better. I have trouble taking to anybody. Even my friends and family. It's like I can think of many things to say but they just don't come out of my mouth. So my friend who saved me always tells me that I am just not the same which makes me feel so great! And Another thing is that I used to be pretty heavy into raving and dancing, and its like I have forgotten how to dance at all. I can hardly move my legs at all which sucks. Not to mention that I can't even find a job now because my interviewing skills have been shot to hell. 



So anyway to all you people out there who want to experiment with all kinds of drugs just be careful, and don't take too much that you end up in a coma and scare the hell out of the people who love you.
