My doctor decided that I should try an all-day ADD medication.  I went from Ritalin to Concerta (Ritalin in a high-tech pill), and finally to Strattera.  I took Strattera for about 2 months.  The results were a bit mixed; the fact that the company describes Strattera as a non-stimulant is perhaps technically true, though I have certainly at times noticed a pronounced stimulant effect.  I can feel the stuff coming on.  There is a nervous energy, though it feels less substantiated than with other similar medications.  



For the first few days the side effects were definitely there - nausea, headache.  Also, I was waking up earlier than usual.



Overall, it seemed to be effective.  I could feel my overall focus and energy levels increasing.  Then, I must have angered the atomoxetine gods because after 5 or 6 weeks, it was making me unbearably tired.  I am reasonably sure that it was the Strattera; if I took it 45 minutes to an hour later I would be lethargic though unable to sleep.  This is a phenomenon I've read about before, that medications which promote the release of chemicals causing the brain to exhaust its supply.  Anyway, I quit taking the stuff and within a few days felt normal.  This is certainly a long term drug, not to be used as an ad hoc treatment, and it certainly helped me at first.
