6:00 PM----I drank 4 oz of Robotussin Maximum strength cough syrup at Fred Meyer's around 6 PM somewhere on the edge of the Pacific Northwest. 



7:00 PM----At home loading the groceries, the DXM began to take hold. I retreated to the computer/(anti-drug) parent's room  and started to robototize rapidly . Surfed to RateMyThong.com and stared at the beautiful asses.



Gave the ol' parents a Master and Commander DVD so I could be left in cyber-peace. I love Erowid. I've grown up with this site and I'm proud of it.



7:40 PM----Thought about Rubix cube and what we have in common with it. I just realized I am in a different life than I was in 2002. Maybe it's all a big reality show and I'm like Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Nirvana is speaking to me.



Ate (6) 25 mg Benadryl tablets. 



9:00 PM----Master and Commander is almost over. I will retreat to bedroom at sign of parents looking in my googly eyes and booting  my ass out for the |||| |||| |||| || 14th time. Good thing I have potential. Cannabis would be great with this high. If I had weed I would have black butter knives.



9:25 PM----Can't you trip like I do? Fog in the computer room. This keyboard is hard to see with nothing but monitor light. I'm so fucking high and my parents are watching Russelle Crowe's British George Washington Wig-style Ship crews fight Napolean in the 1600's.



10:00 PM----Parents are in bed. Watch TV with no concentration skills. Mind expanding as I smoke a cigarette and see a big ass white sheet fly by out of the corner of my eye. I am tripping nicely. Happy high. Motor skills altered if not somewhat hindered. I'm getting tired.



11:45 PM----Don't know what I've been doing except for thinking and staring at things. Perfect combo of DXM and Diphenhydramine.



Off to bed to watch the shadows and closed eye TV. Nice tripping with you. Signing out.
