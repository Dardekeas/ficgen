After a long night of drinking [7 or so drinks], I got home around 6 am and desperately needed to get to sleep. I'm an insomniac, and I was all out of any medications I usually use to sleep, so I took 4 3mg melatonin pills. 



I fell asleep nearly instantly (possibly because of the long night of drinking.) But about 20 minutes later, I woke up with a huge hangover. It was head-splitting, and I couldn't get back to sleep for the life of me. I disregarded the melatonin and figured it just hadn't worked. 



At about 10 am, the head-splitting hangover was gone, but I felt groggy, lazy, unable to focus, and out-of-it. I wasn't happy anywhere I was, and my eyes felt like they didn't want to be open. When I closed my eyes, all of the colors behind my eyelids were vividly turning into shapes, it was all very trippy.



At noon, I had to go out for lunch with my dad. I still hadn't slept, and all I felt like doing was lying down. My heart felt like it was racing but it wasn't. I was scared I was going to just blank out and zone away in the middle of the restaurant. I played sodoku to keep my mind awake, and somehow made it through the awful experience.
