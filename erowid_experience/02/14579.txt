 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\#  



One night I was trying to commit suicide so I took 52 pills of Coricidin Cough \& Cold tablets.  Anyway, I took these pills and passed out.  When I woke up I had the biggest panic attack I've ever encountered and called my mom and then called my therapist.  We decided to set up a session that afternoon.  So I went in and told my therapist how many I took and that I was trying to kill myself.  They freaked out and called the hospital and got me a room in behavioral medicine (like a mental hospital).  I was the second time I had been there.



Well, anyway, they took my blood, then made me pee in a cup.  I kept having to talk with my psychiatrists medical assistant, staff, and my therapist there because they thought I took PCP.  I kept telling them NO I've never took PCP in my life.  So, after telling everyone that, they had to do a little research of their own.  My therapist had to call a Drug Specialist and ask if DXM can show up as PCP in drug tests.  He said that if DXM is taken in large doses it definitely can show up as PCP.
