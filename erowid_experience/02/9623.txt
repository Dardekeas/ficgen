I tried the butane as described on Erowid at 

http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis\_info13.shtml

and found that it worked extremely well.  I used approximately 1 ounce of some dried leaf clippings and about 1/16th an ounce of some really old buds that I had lying around.  



I extracted using two 3.5oz cannisters of ultra-refined butane (lighter

fluid refill) into a 12 inch PVC pipe with a 1.5 inch inner diameter.  I used several small holes in the bottom with a piece of paper napkin as the filter.  My result was about 1.9 grams of pure hash oil (about 5\% yield).



I rolled two 1.5 gram joints and put a small amount (perhaps .2g) of this oil in only of of the two joints.  Then two friends and I compared the effects of these two joints.  The hash-laced joint was clearly much stronger to all three of us-- a much more uplifting, heady high and no `couch lock' effect.  The comedown took longer than with the unlaced joint as well.



The source material was headed for the trash -- I now can't believe I almost threw this away!  This oil is absolutely a treasure.  It took only about 20-30 minutes of effort from start to finish to make.  Highly recommended!
