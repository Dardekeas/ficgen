Ok: so I consider my self a seasoned drug user, I've tried things from pot to MDMA to high doses of diphenhydramine, and various ADHD medications (adderal, focalin, etc..) last summer some friends brought up the subject of synthetic marijuana. I immediatly claimed that is was pointless and you could just smoke pot but i tried it anyways. it wasn't completely mind blowing but some what a little more intense than pot. Since then ive tried various types and forms of `Spice', (damiana extract and skullcap, wild dagga and lemon grass). I enjoy smoking the stuff and the best part is it does not show up in any drug tests and its legal so you can walk down a busy street and smoke the stuff.

So one day me and three well trusted friends traveled to the city to buy the 8 GS stuff once we get there the guy behind the counter gives us some heat because we were minors but ends up selling us the stuff anyway. Once in the car i rolled an extremely fat joint and sparked it up, we rolled the windows up to keep the smoke inside. 
We were on our way to my girlfriends house were she was having a gathering of friends. so beside us four there were three other well trusted friends waiting at the house. About 20 mins into the trip back to my gf's house shit got real.
   
T+20 I look around the car and instantly realize my vision is extremely altered. every thing looked as though it was cut and pasted on to the scenery. my co-tripers looked as though they were taunting me and morphing into disfigured shapes. my body felt completely numb and my head was tingling. My jaw felt like it was electrified and the only outside feeling I could feel was the bass of the car vibrating my body. Music sounded absolutely amazing. The twitters and heavy bass drops of dubstep filled my ears with amazingness. I begin to get a little scared but I tell my self `this is only temporary I will be fine' and I continue to enjoy my altered state. 

T+30: We were approaching my girlfriends neighborhood when my friend started to freak out and show signs of split personality syndrome, he began so speak in a dark voice and bore a twisted face then returned to normal, normally this is all fine and dandy but he was the one driving [[DISCLAIMER**** I nor Erowid condones the act of operating a vehicle during the use of any sort of use of mood altering substances, this is foolish and extremely dangerous.]]  My friend then threatened using the dark voice to crash us into a wall, when I attempted to talk him out of it he told me that ``it had to be done''. He sped the car up then coming out of his personality change he slowed down and began to tell us what was going on with him, he then ranted for  five minutes about how high he was. This is known as ``babbling'' 

T+60 the time is around 12 AM. We arrived at my girlfriends house and he and her friends were envious of our altered state so I gave them a joint I had rolled earlier and we all crammed into her 5x10 basement bathroom.  After smoking in the confined room the air seemed thick as a sheet. Everything was foggy. My mind state is happy and euphoric I felt as though I was having the time of my life. Everything felt great and the rooms of the house were beautiful. When I closed my eyes I felt as though I was spinning on a carnival ride of some sort. I decided that I had never been that high in my life.

T+ 190 minutes : we decide to go back in my friends car and just sit listening to music and to roll another j and a  blunt. We smoke the j in the car and return into the house. I can barely walk. everyone else seemed like they were having an amazing trip but I felt terrible,  my whole body felt like it was shaking and my mind was somewhere else. I couldn't focus on anything, every little detail in the scenery distracted me and every thing sounded echoed. All the scenery looked like it didn't belong, this was similar to the pasted in effected I mentioned earlier. We went back into the house and gathered in the basement. We all agreed we were incredibly fucked up. We sat down and began to bullshit and talk about random shit, we were all babbling. We suddenly started to freestyle rap and make beat boxing sounds with our mouths. My voice sounded foreign and like it didn't belong to me. In my mind I thought as though I was freaking out, I laid on the couch and passed out.

I awoke about an hour later and I was still majorly high. No one was around I I became scared. I feared as though I wasn't actually awake but rather in a nightmare. I soon realized my fellow trippers were in the bathroom smoking more. I could not even fathom why in the name of jesus Christ they would be smoking. I couldn't turn away so I opened the bathroom door and I huge cloud of smoke poured out. I walked in and and began to toke with them. While in the bathroom we smoke 2 more joints and the blunt I rolled.

I felt numb and like I weighed 1000 pounds, my jaw was as heavy as a block of lead. When ever I shut my eyes I felt like I was floating, my body and mind we completely mesmerized. My vision was incredibly blurry. Every movement had ghost trails on it.(ghost trails is seeing multiple visions following one motion.) I felt sick to my stomach. One of the girls was a first time user and she was in the corner crying, seing this triggered in my mind the most depressing felling ive ever felt. I felt so sorry for her and I began to feel overwhelmed with life, I found that everything was complicated and hopeless, I was terrified. I began to lay on the couch and cuddle with my girlfriend.

We were both shuddering, my heart was racing. She looked me dead in the eye and told me she was scared. I tried to go to bed but my mind kept producing unusual thoughts, nothing profound but just random unnecessary things. My friends were beginning to doze off and fall asleep. I kept trying to convince my self to sober up but it was usless. I fell asleep watching the smurfs.

T + 10 hrs. I'm awake but still feel overwhelmed. We all discussed our trips and came to the conclusion that everyone had had a bad trip. That day we went to the mall and the whole time we all agreed that we felt tired and light, almost as if we weren't living but just going through the motions. Getting ready for bed that day my mind went back to normal mode and I layed down and slept soundly.

It should be noted that this was not my first time smoking spice but my most memorable time. While expirimenting with psychedelic substances it is best if you're among really trusted friends.
