I have been reading reports on different experiences of taking Pseudoephidrine at high doses for a while now. I recently read an article relating to an experience of taking 180mg pseudo and having a very euphoric trip. I decided, then, to give it a try.

 

At 3:30 my friend and I took three full strength(60mg) Sudafed tablets each. We then waited for the effects to kick in. We waited for an hour and a half and the only effects felt were a bit of sickness in our stomochs. 

 

At that stage we were convinced that no effect was going to take place. None did. Suprisingly after a half an hour(2 hours in) I lay down, not in any bit tired, and fell asleep until that night.

 

In summary no effects were felt apart from a bit of a headache and and sick stomoch. Not quite what I was expecting.
