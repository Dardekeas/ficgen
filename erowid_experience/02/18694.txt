Preparation: 

I place 4-6 seeds (amounting to roughly one gram) in a frying pan and fry them until the centers are dried and crispy. The seeds will have a smell resembling cooked pumpkin seeds. They also tend to pop.  I don't get the heat too high as this might risk destroying some of the active constituents. 



After the seeds have been `cooked'  I wait for them to cool and remove the protective seed coating. Ground the seeds up as fine as possible in an electric coffee bean grinder. Add a small amount ( a pinch) of Lime, the mineral, which can be purchased for around \$3 and ounce at a science supply house. The snuff creates a very intense effect.  I try to insufflate as much as possible in a short amount of time. The lime burns and sometimes causes sinus infections. Some claim that it lime does not increase the effect. Although I have found it to work better with lime.



I found that another great use of the seeds is to saturate a few grams of dried pulverized seeds in vodka and allow this to macerate for a period of two weeks. Filter and evaporate. The resulting `tar', when smoked, creates a noticeable change in consciousness.
