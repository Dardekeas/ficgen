Dear friends,



I am writing you this letter from the Czech Republic, Europe.  First, please, apologize my poor English -- I hope, you will still understand. I would like to allert all admirers of GHB, since I have recently met several people who built up (during several months of heavy abuse) quite strong dependence on this compound (manufactured mostly by hydrolysis of gamma-butyrolactone). According to my knowledge, the dependence is quite similar to this one on opiates: there is an urge to use the GHB-solution several times a day, even during night (in average about 6-8 doses daily); when abuser tries to stop and abstain from GHB, there is a quite strong withdrawal syndrome and psychotic episodes occur. When these symptoms are over, there is a craving to use this drug once and once again, etc\ldots  Heavy GHB-abusers themselves guess in this regard, that their bodies simply are no longer eager/able to produce GABA as an important neurotransmitter by natural way (what could be potentially quite dangerous). Please, do not consider this letter as a word of a `pannicker' (although I have no idea how many people actually do have this kind of problem).



Yours, JK
