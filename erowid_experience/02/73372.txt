So on this evening like almost every other evening I was preparing to go to bed, and about 30min before settling in took a dose of 100mg of diphenhydramine in the form of a generic sleepaid, and fell asleep shortly there after.



+2h



Got awakened by a nightmare. On waking up I noticed some minor visual distortions that I associate with the delerium of being on a recreational dose of diphenhydramine(150mg+). This did not stand out odd to me. What stood out odd was the fact that none of my physical sensations or my mental state were anywhere near normal. My body felt wispy and part of the air with reduced sense of touch, and I was in a paranoid state thinking my world was falling apart. These sensations and thoughts were, other then some minor differences in the mental, exactly the same for me as if I had taken a high dose of LSD. 



+3h The sensations have remained without change. In attempting to sleep I find myself darting and getting more paranoid in sitting still.



+4h Manage to fall back asleep.



When I woke up in the morning I felt perfectly fine, no hangover that i would associate with having taken to high a dose of diphenhydramine, and just perplexed about these happenings.
