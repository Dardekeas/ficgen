Tending toward hypersomnolent depression, I've always gravitated to stimulants as a partial (and very imperfect) solution. I'm an avowed caffeine junkie, and I use ephedrine sporadically. So, BZP (1-Benzylpiperazine/N-Benzylpiperazine) seemed like a nice candidate for exploration.



I managed to get ahold of a very large quantity of BZP freebase liquid. Since it isn't terribly useful in this form (and caustic to boot), I prepared a solution of BZP HCl in 100mg/mL concentration by mixing appropriate amounts of the freebase and distilled water, and titrating to a pH of 7.0 with concentrated HCl. I did this because preparing nice crystalline BZP HCl is unnecessary, a waste of solvents/chemicals, and complicates dose measurement; liquid can be easily and accurately measured 

with a syringe or marked dropper.



The solution tastes bad, but is tolerable if you have a something to wash it down with (a citrus juice works well). Effects become noticable $\sim$25-35 minutes post ingestion. When I first began to use it, effects peaked at T+4hrs, and then slowly tapered off until T+7-8hrs. After my tolerance built (in my experience, tolerance began to be noticeable after 5-8 days of daily use), effects peaked at about the same time but dropped off much faster, and were usually gone by T+5hrs.



Effects are pleasant. Moderately euphoric, it's main effect was in making me much more social. I was unusually happy (even `bubbly') and enthusiastic, and could become absorbed for many hours on abstract mental tasks (programming, for instance) without becoming the least bit fatigued. There was significantbody load: increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, *heavy* sweating, anorexia, mild weight loss.



My experience is that it's significantly different from (meth)amphetamine and other similar stimulants. It feels more `serotonergic', which, given it's serotonin-reuptake inhibiting properties (see Pubmed), is understandable. It has less of a tendency to produce manic or ego-centric behaviour (again, IMO) and is probably a better choice for people who use stimulants for utilitarian purposes.



Unfortunately, tolerance is a problem. Following the first week of use (1-2x daily), I had to steadily increase my dose to achieve the desired effects . I started at $\sim$60mg and worked up to $\sim$250mg. Every period of use eventually had to be discontinued because the positive effects gradually decreased and were then replaced by a quiet, seething irritability. I ended up snapping at nearly everybody for no reason, walking around with my teeth clenched and my hands in tight fists; in other words, the exact opposite of what I was using it for.



It's also addictive/self-reinforcing. With considerable difficulty (and with several relapses), I managed to stop using it and haven't used it since. On a scale of 1-10 (1 being like caffeine, 10 being like nicotine), it's addictive potential is probably somewhere around 4; not life-destroying, but kicking the habit is definitely a non-trivial proposition.



So: BZP has it's place. Just: Caveat emptor, and use your head.
