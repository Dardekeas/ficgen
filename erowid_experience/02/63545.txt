I ordered 2x 10g bags of dried manicured wormwood after reading up on the psychedelic effects of Thujone.



So this morning, when I awoke and found that my parcel had arrived, I was quite eager to start experimenting right away since i had the whole day off and also tommorrow (friday).



I looked at the bags for a while, gave them a sniff, then googled again to get info on doses etc.  Alot of sites were saying that you have to smoke 10 cones of the stuff before you feel anything - a bit of a letdown as I'm really bad when it comes to smoking cones (2 cones of weed leaves my lungs fucked for days)!!  Then I found a few sites that were saying that it depends on what part of the plant it's from and also whether it's dry enough coz they had experienced effects after like 1 joint.



Ok, what the heck, i went outside with my rollies and rolled 1 ciggarette and 1 fat wormwood joint with a small amount of tobacco spin for easy burning.  I lit the joint up and almost immediately I felt relaxed and slightly buzzy- kinda like I do after having a ciggarette after being without for like 5 days!



The feeling intensified as i continued to smoke the rest of the joint.  once I'd finished the joint I felt increased energy with some euphoria, i was speaking quite quickly and felt a little agitated but about 10 minutes later that feeling had subsided and I just felt slightly stoned.  It's been about an hour since I smoked it - I feel I really want to smoke some more, however I'm sure how i'll react over time and i guess theres a chance it could be laced with any number of poisonous pesticides or what have you, so I'm waiting for another hour to go by before I pull out my bong and try a cone of it.



So far overall its a great cheap substitute for dope (like when I cant afford a it - nothing could replace MJ) i dont think its much of an hullucigen, however Ive only smoked a really small dose so far.
