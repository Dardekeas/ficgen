I have a mild tolerance to opiates - I had taken 22.5 mg of hydrocodone in solution with guifanesin (Vi-Q Tussin) 2 days previous.



T+0:00 

I took orally (no chewing) 2 generic Tramadol pills, 50mg each for a total of 100mg. It was 8:05 PM. I hadn't eaten in 7 hours.



T+0:20 

I began feeling a tingling/massaging sensation in the back of my head, between my ears. The sensation was very mild, but spread to my ears and neck. It wavered in and out of perceptibility.



T+0:30 

At this point I took the third 50mg orally. 



T+0:30 

I connected my headphones to my computer and put on some My Bloody Valentine. Shoegazing is my favorite for opioid induced dazes. 



T+0:50 

I began at this point to experience some stomach discomfort. Light waves of nausea (similar to the nausea felt when taking 300mg+ of DXM) swept my body occasionally, but I did not vomit. I felt like I had to move my bowels, but couldn't.



T+1:10 

I guess this is where the first 2 pills leveled out. I started feeling very relaxed, and in a conservatively upbeat mood. Sort of like the normal opiate feeling, but it `meshed' better\ldots it's hard to explain something like this feeling. It felt very natural to be this way, not `fucked up' at all.



T+2:00

I had been listening to My Bloody Valentine, but at this point the music seemed very powerful, enough to put me into a daze. I just let the iTunes visualizer sweep me away. 



T+2:40 

At this point I felt very social, like I should be talking to lots of people. I signed in on all of my messaging clients and got on the phone with my girlfriend. She told me the next day that I was very slightly slurring my words - apparently I have trouble making the `s' sound. `Stop' became `schtop,' `sex' became `schecks.' Overall, I continued to feel very social.



T+3:50 

I decided to stop talking to people and try to get to bed. I put on headphones and a bit of Dandy Warhols, turned out the lights, and tried to get to sleep.



Sleep was rough. I spent the night in a dreamy daze - not exactly sure whether I'm dreaming or awake, in a state between those two areas of being. I had that old `naked in school' dream. I woke up around 6 am, unable to continue attempting to sleep. I was still feeling the Tramadol at this point. I got onto World of Warcraft and amused myself for a while. I was very open and talked to lots of people; I was very social where normally I am not. 



Overall, I would say Tramadol is a fun experience. I was mildly constipated for the next day or so, but nothing ex-lax couldn't fix.
