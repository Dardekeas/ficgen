I have tried a fair few drugs (MDMA, speed, numerous different ecstasy pills, weed, 2C-I, 2C-B, foxy, coke, ketamine, codeine, acid, DMT (accidentally) etc) and have always looked online to see other peoples experiences, although I've never posted my own. But after trying  4-AcO-DMT last weekend, I feel I have to tell the world about possibly the best experience of my life.



I arrived at my boyfriend's (Adam) house at 11pm, 3 of his housemates who were in the living room had already taken it (not sure how long before I got there, possibly an hour) and offered us some. They said it was quite mild, and much like a synthetic version of mushrooms (a drug which I have not had much experience of) They where all saying what a fantastic drug it was and how it didn't give the ``headfuck'' like mushrooms sometimes can. After a bit of hesitation Adam and me decided to take it, and his housemate gave us each a dose of 15mg. We put the powder into a rizila bomb and swallowed it. 



Note: I have a very slow metabolism, I would say It usually takes me around 30-45mins to start feeling the full effects of a pill or a bomb of MDMA, compared to Adam who starts feeling it after around 15-20min.

 

11.30pm (+0.30) Neither of us really felt anything much (we even talked about going to bed as we where both quite tired!) but we sat and chatted/listened to music with the other housemates for a while.



12.00am (+1.00)\ldots..only had very mild increase in brightness of objects, the blinds in the living room appeared to be swaying. I noticed that glass and plastic objects seemed to be a bit shinier than unusual. Start to see tracings of objects, like if people move their arms, or if I look at something then look away I can still see it. Still very mild, quite unimpressed and said to Adam ``would be better if it was about twice as strong''.



1am (+2.00)\ldots..feeling the effects more now, noticed my body feels quite heavy and very slightly rushy\ldots. Like a weak pill. Nice feeling, not a huge increase in visuals everything's a bit brighter and a little fuzzy round the edges, the flame of a candle is very interesting to look at. Didn't expect it to get any better than this because of how long it has taken to ``come up''\ldots.quite disappointed but still feeling very nice and quite euphoric/happy.



2am (+3.00)\ldots.. all of a sudden it seems to kick in, and starts getting more intense, stronger visuals starting with the window blinds moving/swaying more intensely and am having trouble focusing on anything. Things are much brighter/glowing. Still have lovely body feeling of heaviness but my mind is perfectly clear and I am having no trouble thinking/talking/communicating.



2.15am (+3.15)\ldots.. visuals are quite intense, things appear to be melting/glowing. Between now and 3.30am visuals continue getting slowly stronger, more glowing of objects, things start changing colour and appear to be melting. Have a completely clear memory, there seems to be no loss of co-ordination or ability to think. Feels amazing to walk/move, like I'm pushing against the air at quite a force. I am finding everything very funny\ldots I got into hysterical fits of laughter on a few occasions.



3.30am (+4.30)\ldots. start to get a bit freaked out by the hallucinations. I had a extremely bad acid come down a while ago and the hallucinations now are very strong, which remind me of the acid, try to look at my friends but I find their faces quite distressing, they are melting! I start to question if I will ever be normal again (I don't have a good grip on reality as it is) I start to freak out a bit, I tell Adam I'm not having a good time, I go upstairs and take a 5HTP tablet (which I'm hoping will sober me up a little bit) and go into the bathroom., I get myself a little worked up and panicked, just because I am overwhelmed with what I'm seeing. When I close my eyes I cant get away from the hallucinations, in fact they seem to be stronger. My friend gives me a valium (think it was 10mg) and I decide to go to bed, Adam joins me too, as we are both feeling quite tired. Also take 3x ibuprofen/codeine tablets I have (I love codeine, I was hoping it would make me feel a bit better, couldn't extract it so just took 38.4mg)



 4am (+5)\ldots..am in bed, the Valium and codeine kicks in. I FEEL AMAZING. I'm lying in bed listening to Zero 7, looking at the most beautiful visuals I have ever seen, they are still very strong, although more abstract. All I can see is beautiful geometric patterns swirling in time to the music, everything I can see (the room is semi dark) seems to have this purple and green glowing outline. I cannot even describe in words how beautiful this is. Adam is asleep, and I lie in bed until around 6.30am (around the time I fall asleep). I can't stop slowly waving my hands in front of my face, the tracings look so amazing. The combination was just amazing. I have never felt so happy/euphoric in my life. I am so calm and content with everything in my life. (and I have done MDMA many times, this euphoria is 100X more intense than that feeling). I start to think about things I've been worrying about, but nothing matters. Everything I can see just looks so beautiful I cant describe. I force myself to stay awake as long as possible, because I don't want to fall asleep and stop feeling like this. I remember lying there thinking ``this is the best I have ever felt'' for 2 and a half hours.



When I wake up in the morning I feel totally enlightened. I am so unbelievably happy and feel lucky that I have had the most positive experience of my life. That night honestly changed me as a person, I feel so lucky to be alive and everything just seems so much more precious to me now.
