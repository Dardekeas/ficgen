I heard about Sceletium Tortuosum on the internet. I first bought 1 gram. It was the traditional brown preparation. I separated the finest powder to insufflate it, and I smodked the rest. I found out that it was effective as a mood shifter by itself or smoked in a damiana cigarette, and as a Cannabis booster. So I ordered 20 more grams. 



Again I separated the finest power with a towe in order to sniff it(the more pleasurable way). The effects are quicker and different this way. I smoked the rest with damiana or pot, and sometimes chewed some, most of the time with a nicotine gum. The mix with damiana, coffee or nicotine is nice and energetic. Very quickly, I used it everyday, or nearly, sometimes  many times a day. The Sceletium `high' makes me often want more. It's one of its side effects.



After some weeks of regular use (5 days/ week - several times /day), tolerance has built up. After having used 15 grams (3 months +/-), I bought another 25, which was light green and bitter. It wasnt the traditionnal fermented preparation, but the modern heaten one. Again, I separated the finest part for sniffing.



But something was wrong. I didn't have any positive effects. It wasnt the new preparation, cause it was the same with what was left of my older supply. Everyday, I felt the urge to take some. Something like the need of a cigarette for a tobacco addict. I took repeated doses with no postive effects, but with some depression and a massive instant tiredness.



4 months after my first use I realized that I was taking too much and that it had no positive effects anymore. But It was hard not to take some everyday. I left my home for 8 days, and I avoided to take some Sceletium with me. Though I had some need for it during these 8 days, it was not a problem. When I came back, I resisted 3 days more. The need was lighter at this time. 



Now, I take reduced amounts with  at least 48 hours between 2 hits, more often 3 or 4 days. Everything is fine. The positive mood shift and pot amplification are back. The `take more effect' during the high is manageable and the need to take some everyday almost disappeared.



I'm a former heavy tobacco smoker, and the need for Sceletium was very similar to the need of smoking, except that it happened only once a day, and for 5 or 10 minutes, when the need for smoking was at least 30 times a day, but lasted only 2 or 3 minutes.



So, my conclusion is :

The abuse potential of Sceletium Tortuosum is real.

The `need for more' is a part of the high.

Tolerance builds up quickly when I use it often.

Abuse leads to tiredness and depression.

Increased dosage doesn't give more positive effects, but quickens tolerance and lead to depression.

The stimulating effect is stronger with low doses.

I was really hooked, with a need which seemed hard to resist. But fighting the habit is not so hard. Certainly easier than to fight tobacco addiction.

The secret for keeping Sceletium harmless and pleasurable is to use it at low doses and occasionally. It is not because it is legal and not a strong psychoactive that it doesnt affect you.

Now I'm rather happy with it, and the 10 or 15 grams I still possess will last a long time!
