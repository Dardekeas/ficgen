This was an experiment.



At approximately 9:00 p.m., I prepared the liquids.

Two tablespoons each of commercial kava kava extract,

homemade marijuana tincture, and absinthe. This mixture

was put in the freezer to chill.  At approximately 9:30,

I removed it from the freezer and added as much cold

sparkling water as the total mixture.  It turned an opaque,

swirling greenish color - the fabled louche of absinthe.

I downed it in one gulp. The aftertaste was not as 

unpleasant as expected - the bitterness of absinthe with

sweet anise overtones.



I was at home, relaxed, with no pressing concerns.  By

10:00 p.m., I was the only one still up.  My lips were

beginning to feel numb, the sign that the kava was taking

effect.  I was feeling slightly numb in my extremities.

By 10:15 p.m., I was feeling quite good - even more relaxed,

optimistic and peaceful.  I set up my Dreamachine (a homemade

device that produces light flickers in the low alpha range).

I then smoked a small bowl of high-grade marijuana.  As

it began to take effect,  I sat down at the Dreamachine.



The visual effects came on quite rapidly.  The initial

entoptic imagery gave way to a ceaseless kaleidoscopic

array of color, shape and light, reminiscent of some

accounts I've read of mescaline's effects.  I began to

see clear images within the swirling vortex, forming,

rising up to full prominence, then being sucked down and

replaced with new ones.  My spirit soared as I began to

see \_through\_ the vortex, into a calm and glowing level

marked by a stable geometrical pattern. It appeared to be

hexagonal, in glowing green and yellow - although colors 

such that I've never seen with mortal eyes.



After some ten or twelve minutes of this rapt contemplation

of the fiery fractal mandala that lies on the other side of

darkness, I got up, went to the couch and laid down.  Immediately

upon closing my eyes, I began to see closed eye visuals (CEVs).

These morphed and transformed as inexorably as the ones

before.  After settling in and becoming quite comfortable,

I took up a whipped cream dispenser, exhaled, and took in

a moderate lungful of nitrous oxide.



As I exhaled, I could tell the sensation of air passing

through my trachea had already changed. Inhale, exhale. . . 

and my body began to experience Pure Pleasure.  I felt myself

ascending the World Tree and emerging into the brilliance

of the Living World.  Every joy and pleasure of mortal life

was a mere shadow or gossamer simulacrum of this experience.

Even as I soared above the canopy into the clear blue beyond,

I knew that gravity was pulling me back.  A long long descent

back to my body, where simply being stoned out of my gourd

felt like being stone cold sober by contrast.



I put everything away, brushed my teeth, took two ibuprofen,

drank a glass of water, and went to bed. Got up seven hours 

later feeling fine.



Do NOT attempt this if you are going to be in public.



I intend to repeat this experiment, but not soon and not

very often.  It was an extreme experience.
