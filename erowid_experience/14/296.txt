I usually smoke weed on the regular to help calm me down before i goto sleep.  As the other report stated, i was out of weed, and in need of something to get me buzzing before i went to bed.  I remembered my mom had aquired a bottle of tylenol 3's for a condition she was having with her foot, and had said when she took them, all they did was make her drowsy and dizzy. I also remembered that a while back, my friend had busted his collar bone and had to take pills with codeine in them, and he said they made him hallucinate.  



With no other means of attaining a buzz, i went to her bathroom and took 3 of the tablets to my room, along with a spoon and a full cup of water (the glass was about 6-7 inches tall filled about 1cm from the top.)  I took the spoon and mashed the pills into a fine powder (hoping it would hurry the effects along) and dumped it all into the water and drank it (i had just eaten dinner about 30 - 45 minutes before).  It wasnt the best tasting thing i'd ever had, but i was able to gulp it down without gagging.  Within about 10-15 minutes, i started feeling relaxed and comfortable sitting watching TV.  in the next 10 minutes i started getting dizzy, like when you're drunk (not pissy drunk, just drunk).  The total effect i felt was like when you smoke weed (cotton mouth, euphoria, relaxation) but i didnt have the slightest hint of paranoia\ldots  I'd never tried codeine before this and from my experience, a good lower dosage is VERY enjoyable and relaxing, and if i run out of weed again, ill be lookin for tylenol 3's again :)
