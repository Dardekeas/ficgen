Recently there have been a number of `bath salt' products showing up around the head shops. There is quite a variety, but the one I chose to ingest was called `Ivory Fresh' and came in a small, round, plastic container of 250 mg. Now, I can only guess at which drug the product actually contained. It's definitely some sort of legal stimulant - maybe bk-MBDB, or MDPV?  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



6:00 PM.

I get home and step out of the vehicle, and realize that I can't walk very straight. I've had that effect from large doses of gabapentin before.



But once I get inside, the really interesting effects start. I start getting classical closed-eye psychedelic visuals, like Albert Hoffmann described seeing when he took his famous bicycle ride. Sitting in front of the computer, I can't help but close my eyes (it feels very satisfying). When my eyes are closed, I see visions, places and scenes, different things that change up every few seconds. They aren't as brightly psychedelic as with LSD, the visions seem to be in grayscale. Toned down, less vivid. Nonetheless, here are these random scenes flashing behind my eyes. I decide to lay down in bed and just enjoy the trip and the visuals.



12:00 Midnight.

I awake in my bed, the clock reads midnight. I can't believe I passed out for so long. I can't believe I'd passed out at all - the Ivory has a tendency to keep me awake for a looong time.



In order to get back to sleep, I drink a bottle of Boone's Farm wine (750 mL, 7.5\% abv) and take half a clonidine tablet (0.05 mg). I also take 1.5 mg of melatonin sublingually. By 1:30 AM, I've finished my Boone's Farm and crawl back into bed and sleep the rest of the night.



----------------------------------------------

Post-trip analysis.



Gabapentin and Ivory Fresh are interesting substances on their own, but both of those plus weed, made for a very surprising pseudo-psychedelic experience. It wasn't anything life-changingly profound, like what can happen with LSD or mushrooms. But it had some visual effects and tactile sensations that were reminiscent of a full-blown psychedelic trip. Whatever kind of mickey-mouse MDMA analog is in Ivory Fresh, I believe contributed greatly to the visuals. It's got to have some kind of effect on the serotonin system.



Gabapentin is a bit of a downer (sedative) on its own. Combined with weed it's even stronger. But I was very surprised that it could bring me to sleep, after consuming so much of a strong stimulant. I guess I underestimated the strength of several grams of gabapentin. Gabapentin is a marvelous drug on its own, and especially combined with benzodiazepines. I won't go into more detail here, but I have used gabapentin on and off for a few years, and will continue to do so.



Overall, I enjoyed the experience. However, I'm not willing to repeat it. Comparing the effects I get from Ivory Fresh with what I've read of MDPV, leads me to believe that what I snorted was primarily diluted MDPV. (Although I could be completely wrong!) In any case, it felt *very* hard on my body - it's not something that I plan to use again.
