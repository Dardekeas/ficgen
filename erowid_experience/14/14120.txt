Let me just preface this by saying Golden Teachers teach if you let them.  



And so it began by three of us I, M and L all munching down our little baggies of teachers on a street in I and M's hometown.  We all consumed relatively the same amount and the same strain.  I'd say within 25 minutes I noticed the pavement looking a bit distorted but I have always seem movement in objects my brain should filter out as being still.  My physical effects came in five minutes later with me having a typical type of heavyness.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



At this point I was driving ans said to L who was in the front seat, `better get to my house'.  She nodded knowing exactly what I meant.  I had played prop in two rugby matches earlier that day so I figured I'd try to nap before the stuff kicked in as I was a bit tired.   I have noticed trying to sleep on mushrooms seems to always produce a negative reaction and have yet to figure out why, my guess is part of you wants to sleep and the other is going jesus man you are missing out on something here.



Anyway, after a half hour of half sleeping other friends of mine came into the room and woke me up L convinced me that sleeping wasn't a good idea.  Their faces were slightly distorted this about 90 minutes in.   This next part is atypical of past experiences but I stood up from my bed and wham, a huge whack and I was into the abyss.



My red light in my room had dominated half my room and a green tint was cast on the walls that where not red.  L was now laying on the bed and energy was flowing all around her curves like a clear river.  For a brief second she turned into medusa and then looked exceedingly attractive (in a non sexual way).  I then looked at myself in the mirror and\ldots \ldots .no words for that one.  Somehow L appeared there next to me and seemingly the exact time we said wow.



For the next while I'm guessing an hour I walked around saying minimal mostly wow and yeah with a grin on my face the peak I cannot really describe other then a total flow of sensory input distorting time so much that living in the moment seemed possible.  It was quite zen.  I had an idea that all the senory distorts time because with the exstensive input my brain might say hey all that happened it must have taken this long.  But really all I am doing is seeing/hearing/ etc. more at that particular point in time.



The next decisive string of events which seemed significant was my falling in between my couch and table with a plant on it, for some reason I stayed there while L and a non tripping kid where tyring to tell me thep lant was falling off I just did not care and found a large amount of enjoyment in sitting there. Luckily they moved the plant for me to my living room floor which I found insanely comical.   The very Idea of pet plants.



By now they had peaked about 3.75 hours after the eating of the bag.  Another important part I noticed was in the hours of comming off the plateau.  I and L also percieved so many realities, those of the people around us about 12 people in all and the big reality we all where in and still are in.  It's interesting because we could actually see the path and energy flowing around in these realities.  L told me she wasn't afraid of death anymore about 6 hour into it and I congradualted her.  She still claims this.



A little bit of notes on the experience:



Intense but mentaly linked visuals



Only partial ego was dissolved



I had injested the yohimbe hearing it was an MAOI but could not conclude if it had any real effects



I had been victorious in two matches of rugby earlier that day so had a jolly mindset
