($\sim$2-5X Extract followed by some Valerian root)



On my 6th time smoking Salvia divinorum, I did it alone, finishing the extract that I had tried the day before with C\_\_. I was sitting on my couch with earphones playing music (an ambient track I composed) and I inhaled a bowl of extract in 2 hits. The head-spin effects came very very quickly and I could REALLY tell that this was a 5X extract. 



When everything was unfolding before my eyes, I decided to close them to concentrate on the vortex. Behind closed eyelids, there was a lot going on as I felt my consciousness leave the back of my head very quickly. This is the moment that I never remember what happens, the moment that I don't know what is going on. With music very close to my ears, it was easy to concentrate on what was going on, especially because I composed the music myself, so the feelings were already all mine. 



At this moment, I somewhat `forgot' who I was. I didn't know who I was and why I existed. I was alienated of my own self, it was almost scary considering I was alone. I completely forgot the meaning of my immediate past and my immediate future as they became very vivid and apparent to me. At this point, I was thinking to myself: `Oh no, I forgot who I am and how to live!', in astonishment. 



A few minutes later when the effects began to decrease, my thoughts calmed down. I strongly think that music, if created with the right intention, can induce the thoughts of a Salvia trip. With my eyes still closed, I wondered how long I had been sitting there, I had absolutely no idea. I thought that the song playing wasn't over yet so it had not been 10 minutes yet. About 8 minutes later, I stood up finally.



Basically, what happened is that I stopped thinking in a linear way of past, present, future and was conscious of all three at a different point of view. After T+30 minutes I felt completely normal again, only more relaxed and with enhanced hearing, smelling and tasting senses. I consumed a teaspoon of Valerian root in cold water which chases the insomnia I often get after Salvia experiences and set me in a very relaxed state, I think I recall my astral body wanting to exit my physical body twice, which is what the effects of the roots create.



For the first time, I really think the Salvia being introduced herself to me\ldots  (finally) I think she said her name is Marie or Maria, that's what I remember. I have learned not to smoke extract without a sitter, who knows what I could have done with any higher dose!
