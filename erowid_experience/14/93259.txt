I started taking 5-htp as it was suggested  by GNC staff as an alternative to ST Johns Worth, which I was taking as a light antidepressant. I decided to change since I was starting to get skin stains because of the St JW, and the 5htp apart from being a mood uplifter was supposed to work with insomnia as well. I took the maximum dose suggested by the pharmaceutical. 



The first couple of weeks I felt great, I could immediately feel the difference in my mood and sleeping was easy. However, all of a sudden I found myself with bursts of anger and depression. I was emotionally totally out of control, extremely vulnerable and anxious. As I was trying to figure out what was upsetting me I remembered the 5htp. I stopped taking them and literally, a day after I felt the down of the pills, just extremely tired. A day or two later I felt normal again. GNC stuff could be really scary, I would never take that again.
