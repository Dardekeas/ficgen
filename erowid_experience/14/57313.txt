I'm 29, and an epileptic, currently in the process of getting off my anticonvulsant pills. The first time I tried smoking grass was 5 years ago, when I was 24. I've wanted to try it before, but always feared of the impact I'd have, considering my medical condition. I've always thought I'd wait till I found someone I could do it with - someone who'd be trusted, in case I had a seizure. And then I found someone, who turned out to be my partner for the following 4 and half years.



We met as neighbors, and it wasn't long till the thought of trying smoking grass with her popped up. At my 2nd time, I got paranoid. I started getting ticks, especially in my legs - which horrified me, since it was a sensation I remembered getting just before I seized up. It was her reaction that helped me get through that - she explained it was the thc, and not the epilepsy.



Now, 5 years later, I'm still smoking grass regularly, usually on a daily basis.

Before smoking, I used to get seizures about 3-4 times a year, sometimes more. I've only had one seizure since. It's already been 4 years, seizure-free, and I only have grass to thank for.



Sometimes I'd forget to take my pills with me, If I wasn't sleeping at home. I started noticing that if I smoked, I'd get less auras, and would be able to get through the night. The more I smoked, the less side-effects I'd get from the epilepsy.

In according with my doctor's orders, I'm now reducing my monthly dosage of anticonvulsant pills, and will ween off them in about 4 months.
