Had just begun up-titration of sertraline as per my prescriber to deal with major depression. Had taken wellbutrin for a while but had started to develop shakes in my arms and ringing in my ears. As she'd warned, the first few days of the sertraline made me feel very antsy/nervous, so I took some lorazepam/Ativan to deal with that, and it helped. However, when up to 200mg dose, I went to a party with classmates and blacked out very early into the night and ended up cheating on my girlfriend, something I had never done despite many temptations when drinking. I wonder if the combination made my inhibitions even lower, or something. The hangover the next day was horrible, but combined with guilt, so I don't know how to discriminate between them. 



I quit the sertraline after this experience, telling my prescriber it was due to the akathisia when it really was out of fear of drinking again and doing something stupid. Watch out when mixing with booze, I'm realistic, I know people drink, it's not enough to say just `don't do it', just be aware and be careful.
