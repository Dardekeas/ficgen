The night before we purchased around 2 grams of Ketamine and experienced with small doses of around 10mg at a time, after around 5 doses we were experiencing some fairly strong hallucinations, my friend and I were laying on the bed and his girlfriend was sitting up in the middle of us, her face suddenly morphed and her eyes turned large and square, like the old TDK commercials, we instantly both exclaimed she was the `TKD chick' then were amazed we were both experiencing the same visual hallucinations as each other, she exclaimed our faces to her were just continually morphing into different people. 



We then decided to go for a drive, however walking outside we all perceived the same thing, that being the end of the driveway seemed miles away and the car was a tiny almost toy like image in the distance, we decided it was best to stay inside. We were talking for awhile then a friend came over, he was sober and exclaimed that we were talking like retards and he could hardly understand us, which was strange because we perceived we were talking normally and could completely understand each other, however he seemed to think we were all pretty badly wasted and didn't really talk to us.



The night after was the most profound experience, I was at home sitting at the computer talking on IRC talking to a friend when I decided to have a line of K to induce some visuals and liven things up. I packed up a line about 50mg worth, having had about the same amount the night before I assumed it would induce similar effects. However after sniffing the line, I felt extremely light headed, I thought to myself `Get to bed quickly' so I stumbled up and walked into my room, when almost at my bed I remember falling head first towards it then just before I hit the bed I left my body. I was falling through the earth, seeing many different layers of soil, sand, rock clay. It seemed like forever until I entered a glowing yellow and red area then suddenly appeared in this open glowing red area which appeared to be Hell. 



I looked around, there was many channels of flowing lava and glowing red pathways seemingly carved out of rock, also around was many caves or tunnels. I remember thinking `I've taken too many drugs, I've died, my parents are going to be destroyed when they find me dead in my room', this quickly changed to a more positive view, I said to myself `Look your dead now, your in hell, may as well look around'. I started walking down the pathways and through caves, it seemed like I was walking for around an hour when I suddenly found this opening to a large area with a huge chair in it, intrigued I walked in and the Devil appeared in the chair, I yelled out in fear and the devil laughed at me and began screaming at me hundreds of reason as to how worthless, pathetic and weak I am, every word he said seemed to penetrate my soul and emotionally destroy me, each word was like being beaten senseless and heart breaking a million times over what was possible in human form. I was in tears screaming `STOP PLEASE STOP', it was then I began to be lifted upwards, the Devil pointed to me and said to me while still laughing `You have been saved for now, but you will be back'.



I was taken up again through the earth, through all the many layers of the earth's body until I appeared out of the ground into my room again, I seen myself laying on the bed face down and seemingly dead, I was then lifted out of the roof of my house, seeing all the roads and houses connecting to mine, outwards into the sky, city lights everywhere until I could see the whole of Australia, this continued to move outwards I remember seeing earth get further and further away, then things sped up to a amazing speed. I was carried past hundreds of stars and other planets until there was nothing but darkness, the darkness carried on for what seemed like weeks until everything became extremely bright, everything was becoming white until suddenly it consumed everything. I was in a place where only white light existed and when I looked up I seen a HUGE person standing above me, his feet seemed to be 100 stories high and there was a huge white robe hanging down with golden stitching making up the base and middle, I could only see half way up his legs before the rest was covered in white light and I could not make out any more, his legs alone seemed to be at least 50 kilometres high. He said to me in a deep, friendly and non direct voice `If you do not change your ways, something bad is going to happen to you', I yelled out `What will happen, please tell me, what is going to happen' then I suddenly woke up face down in my bed.



I was experiencing the most extreme fear I'd ever felt in my life and thought weeks or months had passed, I got up and looked at my computers calendar, it was the same day, I looked at the time, only an hour had passed. I couldn't believe it, it seemed like so long, I thought what the hell happened to me, did I die, I met Satan, I met God, what the hell does this mean, am I even alive now or am I still dead, I cried for about 5 minutes trying to figure out what just happened to me. Then I remembered the Ketamine, I had no idea what a K hole was at this time so I figured I had an overdose and it must have all been a trip. I went to lay down in my bed for awhile still very confused trying to come to terms with what I had just seen, eventually I fell asleep. The next morning I woke up and called a friend of mine and told him what happened, he laughed and exclaimed `You had one insane K hole dude' and then explained what a K hole was to me.



To this day I still can't figure out if what I seen was true or not, I do know however that after that experience I did not change my ways, kept doing drugs for awhile and ended up having a psychotic and derealisation / depersonalisation disorder that I did not fully recover from for 2 years afterwards. Maybe that was what I was being warned about, or maybe it was all just a trip and coincidence. Either way I have extremely cut down my drug use these days and am too scared to try ketamine again for fear of what might occur the next time. Still I do not regret having the experience, it definitely opened my mind up to many spiritual elements I had never believed in beforehand and has given me a totally new perspective on life.
