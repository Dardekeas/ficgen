I'm a 17 year old male from Northern California. I'm a freshman biochemistry major, and over the last\ldots  year and a half, I've been experimenting with drugs. I do feel that my experimentation has improved my life immensely. However, my experimentation is very controlled, very careful. I'm a very cautious guy, but I'm usually willing to give things a shot, in a very limited vision of `acceptable risk'.



So I figured I'd give people my version of the straight dope on methamphetamine. See, I've been on prescription amphetamines before. I don't have ADD, but I am slightly autistic, and this does affect my ability to focus on the right things at the right time. The amphetamines I take mainly make it easier to sit through seven hours of classes without getting all moody and bored. I don't take them every day, certainly not on weekends, and they're just kind of a nice booster sometimes. The side effects I get are mainly a pounding heart, a bit of nervousness, and a weird, uncomfortable comedown phase where I'm no longer high, but still very jittery and overly focused.



Enough about that. Here's a bit of background on how I ended up trying meth. It's a pretty funny story. Basically, I've got this hairdresser who's 38 years old, lots of fun, who I hang out with a lot outside of getting my hair cut. She's been cutting my dad's hair for 19 years, since she was 19. She started cutting my hair a while back, and she's known me since I was about 8 years old. Anyway, as I got to know her better in the social venue, outside of a business-client relationship, I started to get a whiff of some of what she was into, recreationally. Eventually, she felt comfortable enough that I wouldn't tell my parents about her other life, which they have no idea about; she showed me her use of crystal meth. She calls it CR, for short. She's actually one of the few responsible meth users I've heard about. She doesn't do any of that `stay up for five days and flip out' stuff I've heard of. She has a bump with her cocktail, stays up painting, and sleeps afterwards. Her self-made schedule allows this behavior with very few complications.



About a month ago, my roommate from college and this kid we met from our dorm hall decided to take a road trip up to my hometown. We partied with my hairdresser. She offered us bumps, and we were all pretty innocent. I mean, I've done a bunch of psychedelic stuff, but nothing *hard* like\ldots  *shudder*\ldots  crystal meth. My roommate was an occasional pot smoker. That's pretty much his whole experience. I think I kinda corrupted him. Either way, we had a cocktail (none of us really drink at all), and then we decided to go ahead and try a bump of meth. The bump was basically a normal line, pushed into a fat bump for faster snorting. My hairdresser has great connections, and the stuff was very pure. So I snorted it. I was a bit scared, worried about my cardiovascular system, etc\ldots  five minutes later, it hit.



It was no freight train. It was no massive, scary rush. The only way I can describe it is it's like being incredibly sober. Like, more sober than sober. Imagine all the clouds, the fuzzy thoughts, the impaired consciousness of everyday living. Imagine all those lingering tentacles that pull us every closer to sleep. Now imagine it all getting cleared away. Nothing blocks your consciousness. Nothing impairs. All you are is aware. Methamphetamine felt clean. It felt like the psychic windshield getting scrubbed to a perfect sheen. It had none of the heart pounding, or the jitters of my ADD medication. There was no anxiety. It was just a good mood and a sharp demeanor.



It lasted about four or five hours. Insomnia was present. My mind was too focused to be allowed to drift in to dreamy nothingness. However, a few hours afterwards, I dosed some Xanax and Ativan in an attempt to get to sleep. Eventually, around 4 AM, I drifted off. I woke up at around 10 AM, feeling pretty darn good. I went and awoke my friends, and we headed up. I've had methamphetamine a few times since then, and it's pretty much the same thing. Every now and then, it's a nice way to stimulate conversation, liven up an evening, and enjoy the company of friends. Really, when used responsibly, it's not a problem. I don't know if the reason I don't have a huge desire to do it a lot is because of my ADD medication, which has gotten me kinda indifferent to stimulants. Like Vicodin, methamphetamine has fallen into that category of `nice'. It's not amazing or life-changing like mushrooms are for me. It's just kinda enjoyable, no harm, no foul. There aren't really any strings attached to it. So there's meth for ya. No stigma, no overblown descriptions. It just kinda is.

(0.5 mg) and Lorazepam (1 mg) about 6 hours later.

Until next time, enjoy and be safe!
