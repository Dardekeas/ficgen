A couple of friends were going to come over and the deal was if they smoked me out then I would give them some Xanax.  I took four .5mg tablets (2mg total) of Xanax 20 minutes before they arrived.  By the time they got to my house, I was in a state as if I were slightly drunk.  We immediately started smoking weed.  I took like 6 hits, got up to give them their Xanax and stumbled on the way to my dresser, and the next memory I have is waking up in my bed at 7:30 the next morning.



I don't remember jack shit.

It was a flash from walking to my dresser to waking up in my bed as if nothing ever happened in between.



My mom was in my room the next day and I go `Thanks for leaving this empty box of peanut brittle in my room after you ate it' (the computer is in my room) and she replied `That was in here when I got here.'  What the fuck?  Apparently I ate a whole box of peanut brittle.  I wonder what else I did.
