For years I have been searching for something that would flip that switch in my brain which allowed me to think clearly, read quietly, think before I act, and enjoy life without taking unnecessary risks. 



I have adult ADD. I have been prescribed a few ADD drugs including Strattera and Wellbutrin. Both had negative side effects for me. I found Piracetam mentioned on an article comment on the web. I decided to try it after some research. After my first dose I went directly to the bookstore, the logic was that if I was going to have a rare bad reaction to a new drug, I was going down in public. After it took effect, I realized that when I read a book, the rest of the world went completely silent. This effect was amazing to me. The focus effects were not so pronounced after the first day, but came back slowly within 3 weeks. I am in college so I need to write papers often, which I normally hate. I now can study diligently and write papers without much struggle. I used to get stressed about forgetting things, but I am remembering much more on a regular basis, and I am more organized.



ADD is nasty, and makes me feel very incompetent at times. Piracetam has helped me to stay focused and less stressed. I feel like I can make rational decisions without feeling overwhelmed. I feel much more confident in my abilities and interactions with other people. 



Dosage:

800mg Piracetam + 310mg Choline twice daily
