First I should preface this with my first two experienecs with 2c-i.  Both were extremely pleasurable experiences.  The first time I ingested 25mg orally and had a surprisingly moderate reaction to the chemical.  I was completely in control and had limited visual and sound distortions.  Two weeks later I dosed again on 20mg (followed by 1 bowl Cannabis, +1:30) prepared the same way (dissolved in hot water), and had one of the more pleasurable experiences of my life.  Colors were very vivid with very strong visual presences.  Music was wonderful to listen to.  While on a walk I felt what I would have described as the most euphoric 5 minutes of my life.  It is important to note that both of these doses were from the same batch.  



My third trip on 2c-i could be described as the most horrible experience of my life.  The substance was from a newly ordered batch and tested for any impurities that may have been harmful / innane.  We measured it by dissolving it in pure ethyl alcohol (Everclear) and in total I ingested 20 mg orally, which I was completely able to handle before.  What lay ahead of me, however, was something I was completely unprepared for.



I felt something wasn't right after 2 hours when nothing had taken any effect, as the first two times on 2c-i I started to feel noticable sensations at +1:00.  My friends and I who were all tripping quite hard decided to leave their house and head to a terrace on the lake to relax and just get some fresh air.  I decided to stop at home to grab a coat and listen to a bit of music while I caught up to them.  While I was at home playing some of my record I began to lose control very quickly.  My thoughts became completely dissociated and I couldn't focus on anything.  My visual field and hearing became extremely blurry and everything pretty much blended together in one giant mess.



What followed was a panic attack unlike anything I could ever imagine.  I felt my heart beating extremely quickly and I started to break into a sweat.  I felt clenching in my chest and thought that I had overdosed on the substance, that I was going to die in my apartment alone.  My legs and body felt very weak and heavy and I put all of my strength into not sitting down and giving in to what I thought was the end.  I basically lost my mind completely.  I jumped in my shower and ran cold water over myself to try and slow what I thought was an impending heart attack.  Throughout this entire ordeal I was within seconds of calling 911.  I thought of all the family and friends I would be leaving behind and went into an emotional tailspin.  



My only hope at this point was to locate my friends.  I forced myself to become coherent enough to use my phone and meet up back at my friends' apartment.  Walking 10 minutes seemed to take 2 hours as it was a struggle for me to breath and coordinate movement.  Throughout the whole walk I still had the feeling that my heart was beating way too fast and I was going to collpse, but at least now I knew someone would find me.  



When I finally arrived back at my friends' apartment I explained my situation to them, who are all experienced users like I am, and they slowly talked me out of it into a calm.  After a few hits off of a pipe, surprisingly, my paranoia gradually went away and I was able to deal with life again.



I guess my major moral of this story is, if I am on a substance as strong and unpredictable as 2c-i, I should be sure to stay with the group.  I had spent time by myself on it before and have a very strong mindset when it comes to overpowering the mental effects of drugs, but this completely changed my mind.  Have people around to keep me in check and, in a worst case scenario, to help in case something goes wrong.  



I am still suffering some mild emotional trauma from this event.  Anytime I feel a little bit odd I wonder to myself if I affected myself permanently, and I begin to flashback into a mild panic attack.  I am hoping these things will go away through time, as I will never be dealing with 2c-i again.  This is not a substance to be taken lightly.
