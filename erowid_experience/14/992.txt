A few days ago I was fortunate enough to pick up 1/2 gram of pure Ketamine for \$20.  I've done K quite a few times, but the K that I had bought this time seemed at least twice as potent.  The most I had ever done was 250 mg, and I didn't get any psychedelic effects from it.  The most that I ever got was feeling extremely numb.  Keeping this in mind, I cut 250 mg into 4 lines and snorted them one after another.  After that, I put some music on, turned off the lights and laid on my couch.  Five minutes later, I started noticing the effects.  They started off like all of the other times I've done K, but quickly changed into the most intense experience that I have ever had in my life.  At first, I felt like I was being bent and twisted by an invisible force.  Soon after, the rest of my room was moving the same way that I was being twisted.  I thought that my whole reality was a hallucination in someone else's acid trip.  I was then sucked into my couch and into another reality.  I stared at the ceiling and started falling and spinning down an endless tunnel.  When I finally stopped falling, I looked over to my side and saw some kind of life form slowly emerge from the floor.  It stood above me and stared at me for a few seconds and then went back into the floor.  After it was gone, it felt as if I had gained the knowledge of how all of reality works.  Then, I started levitating back up the tunnel and back into my old reality.  After this was over, I finally had the urge to get up and move.  Instead of feeling just the normal numbness, I couldn't even feel myself moving, and everything was still bending and twisting around me.  I checked the clock and what had seemed like an eternity was only 45 minutes.  The K started to wear off after that, but I still felt enlightened.  As usual, I felt completely `normal' about an hour and a half after I took the K.  I liked this experience a lot more than LSD, psilocybin or mescaline because there were very few bad side effects with the K.  I also slept well after it was over with and felt fine the next day.  The only thing that I don't like about K is the horrible taste it leaves in my mouth.
