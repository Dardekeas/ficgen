\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SUBSTANCE\_ID\_QUESTION\#\#

[Erowid Note: From the description of effects, it seems possible that the plant smoked was in fact Salvia, possibly as a result of a mix-up?]



So my brother decided to come to my dorm and had some sinicuichi and a chillum in his truck. I was expecting to get a weird kind of high with at most. After one hit I was kind of high and noted its somewhat similarity to salvia, as soon as I exhaled the second and last hit my head fell back and I hit my head on the wall behind me. I felt like I was composed of the flying pages of a book and actually believed it. Then as I watched the tv I was seeing an infomercial telling me that I was composed of the flying pages of a book except that the pages didn't actually form a book but that I was a three pen set that the infomercial was trying to sell. That was about when I came out of it.
