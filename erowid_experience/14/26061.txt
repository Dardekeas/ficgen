We started out last night taking 1.5 grams each of mushrooms, a total of 3 grams split between myself and a friend. Once the shroomy anticipation feel started to come on, I waited a little longer and then got a balloon of nitrous. I did this first balloon, which morphed my mind into nitrous space. Coming out of the high, I no longer felt that anticipation. I must say this was a good way to enter a trip.



Then, I lit up a nice fat dutchie containing some nice fat nugs. At this point I decided that I would take the next nitrous phase after the blunt was done. Once the blunt finished, I had asked to be continually refilled on nitrous until 1:00am. This would add up to about 30 minutes of continued nitrous anesthesia. I began taking the nitrous to my procedure, ensuring that I get plenty of oxygen, also giving my mind something to concentrate on. Soon afterwards it really hit me. I'll consider this next phase the peak of the trip, with the most profound revelations.



Profound revelations can't even explain what I was feeling while passing in and out of consciousness on the verge of complete anesthesia. I can only attempt to explain the total knowledge and ego transcendence I experienced. Firstly, during the topmost peak, I got pixel vision. Every neuron was supersensitive, enough to be able to recognize, track, and see the individual dots that make up what I see. Secondly, around the same time, something interesting happened. I'm not sure what I was trying to do or what I was looking for, but some thread of consciousness took me to locating something of relevance.



Wait, now I remember. My associate operating the tank had left for food, so it was time for me to locate the tank to continue my anesthesia until 1am. I wasn't sitting near it, so I had to locate it.



Everything broke down. It was as if all I saw was a black, nondescript slate with little items placed on it. I could relate it to my field of vision being a flat plane, like a desk, with objects existing but me not necessarily acknowledging their physical position. Rather, each item was my brain's representation of how I perceive those objects.



So it was time for me to move. Each object I looked at popped out and became closer and more focused. I went from item to item, each one popping out and then falling back. It was as if each representation of each object I knew that existed in my field of view, was overlaid like icons on the background of the room. I was so far from reality that I had to think, `Ok\ldots  I see the TV remote. This is the remote. Where to now? Ok, I'm at the TV. Where to now? Alright, I see the floor. Time to modify my physical properties (aka move)'



Complete understanding. I could feel each neuron in my brain, and recognize the feeling of each one firing. Consciousness became a stream of cells firing, simply a biochemical means of awareness. I was no longer attached to my physical body. Hell, forget physical location, dimensions, or even this profound thing called time. Those all were so variable. It was like I had an infinite access to all my lifelong knowledge and instincts. It's as if I was able to understand and know things that I had never learned. I saw a few representational visuals of cosmic things. I'm not sure what exactly some of it meant but it was with much significance.



I decided that I wanted to leave a few artifacts in my head, so that I could follow one thing to another and hopefully find that ego transcendence without a chemical trigger (ex, reach it during meditation). I think it worked, because after I was done the nitrous I was still feeling it strong. The trip made it easy to stay in the state, and continue to exist in this state. For up to 45 minutes after discontinuing the nitrous, I could still reproduce the effects. The nitrous auditory buzz was easily recalled and regenerated. I tripped for a few hours after this.



Trips on nitrous are definately an experience. The nitrous aids slipping into ego transcendence, and the shrooms keep the mind alert and active while in this powerful state. The next experiment will be with insufflated 5-MeO-DMT and 20 minutes of nitrous (during the typical anxiety/death peak). This should make the 20 minutes seem much longer and better utilized, and upon coming out of nitrous I'll be onto the better part of the DMT trip.
