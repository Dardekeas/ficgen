6:00 - Took 25 mg of 2-ct-2 orally. 



6:50 - Saw flashes out of the corner of my eye and kept turning my head to see what it was coming from. 



7:30 - Looking outside I notice every little detail of everything. Everything is intensified by a hundred, I notice smells and see details and hear sounds I had never noticed before.



7:35 - Feeling sick to my stomach, think I am going to die but don't care.



7:55 - Vomit my guts out



8:00 - Take a massive hit of meth for the first time.



8:30 - Feel the meth high taking over the 2c-t-2 high. Since the occasion I have smoked meth a handful of times, and let me say no time was anywhere near as good as the time I did it on 2c-t-2. 



9:00 - Relaxed yet very awake and alert



1:00 AM - Can't fall asleep so I start cleaning my house. Three of my friends came over an hour ago and are going to spend the night.



1:30 AM - Still can not sleep so I paint my bedroom



5:00 AM - Force myself to go to sleep. If I tried I could easily have stayed up for the rest of the day.



Over all 2c-t-2 is the best high I have ever had, and mixing it with meth just made it that much better.
