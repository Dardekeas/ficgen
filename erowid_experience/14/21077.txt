The night wasn't suposed to be this insane, it all started off very simply where a few friends and I were suposed to go to this rather small party. I was planning on taking one MDMA pill with my friend Jack, while the others who were with us would be drinking.  Jack and I were under the impression we had very powerful MDMA pills which we were very happy about, while we were being driven to the party Jack and I had popped one suposed MDMA each. Thus began what I like to call the never ending night.



It was quite a long drive and I recall myself comming up in the car, I was getting visuals and a touch of euphoria which was suprising because I had never gotten visuals this early in a MDMA trip, which originally made me think that i was in possession of MDA (it was actually 5-meo-dipt pacman pills) which was still good news to me.  As the car drive continued I noticed the visuals getting stronger and the Euphoria lessening. The type of visuals i was recieving were vaguely interesting, I was watching the speedometer of the car and it seemed to be moving around in a circular motion.



We finally arrived Jack and I were definately feeling something the only problem was we had no idea what.  I had slight stomach discomfort, but not nearly bad enough to ruin my time.  Our group consisted of Jack, his twin brother Neil, Chris and Daniel.  Everyone but Jack and I were planning on getting very drunk, Jack and I preferred the psychadelic experience. As we walked into the house we found out to our slight displeasure that we had crashed a private Birthday party that only Daniel was invited to.  But we decided to stay as unwelcome guests which is all fine and dandy for the drunks in our group, but for Jack and I who were tripping out quite badly it wasnt an enticing idea. I can best describe the experience as being very shy, kind of in a mushroom world but without the mindfuck, and maybe a little bit of euphoria.



At this time Jack and I were feeling quite edgy so we decided to go outside for a walk and smoke some pot. And did that ever help,at this point Jack and I were certain that we were on a non-md substance.  We returned to the party only to walk outside again and keep smoking pot. At this point I produced my vial of rush, I inhaled the rush and passed it to Jack he did the same, and it felt like i was shot out of cannon and all of a sudden ripped back into reality, followed by the most insane maniacal laughing fit ever.



We looked at each other and our faces had completely gone red, we were still chuckling. Although we both agreed that we were dissapointed in the e, we would try to make the most of our night.



We ran inside to where the party was only to discover Neil and Chris drunk out of their minds, and Daniel fairly drunk as well. Where we introduced Rush to everyone. We took out the video recorder to record the experience, because it was everyone's first time inhaling rush.  At first only our group was willing to try and they were hesitant.  But after 4 consecutive laughing fits people were all fighting over that funny littl vial. It was perhaps one of the most interesting things ever to see so many bright intelligent people taking hits of a small little vial laughing rolling around.  



Jack and I at this point decided to split one more fake E(5-meo-dipt).   we went into the washroom i bit off half the pill and swallowed quickly followed by a gulp of beer to kill the foul taste. and gave the seccond half to Jack.



We walked back into the party room with good spirits.  Only to find Neil puking all over the place and antagonizing our unfriendly hosts.  From this point on a fight almost broke out several times. Jack and I quietly enjoyed observing this funny somewhat alien drunken behavior.



The party's level of class kept degenerating throughout the night, with bottle rockets being shot out of Chris's mouth, and then chris trying to shoot a bottle rocket out of his ass much to the entertainment of our group, who was just trying to have fun. At one point our companion chris took off his pants, to the displeasure of our loser hosts, probably because they were really homophobic.



During this time i had downed aproximately 6 drinks.  I was feeling a little buzzed off the alcohal, a little high off the mystery drug as shane and i had named it, and a little stoned off the pot. We kept taking hits of rush throughout the night followed by insane laughing fits.



There was an issue about our hosts trying to steel Neil's cds and hiding them in the freezer. we found them and stole some beer to punish them, if a fight broke out Im confident our group would have destroyed them making them timid to do anything really confrontational to us.  



We had finally left the party, and we were glad to have crashed such a jerk's birthday. Chris went home, and Daniel and I went to Jack and Neil's house.



This is when stuff really got fucked up.  Neil was really drunk, and really wanted to do magic mushrooms. Jack was too tired, (it was 3am) and i was eventually persuaded into joining him, but i would only do it if they would give me their last E pill which was real mdma, unlike the crappy ones we had recieved that day.  Daniel decided he would stay up and watch us, so he took some smoked a fair ammount of crystal meth.  



SO here i was drinking Mushroom tea with Neil, and with the last gulp i washed down my E pill. Neil was on the verge of passing out from his drunkeness at this point, so i went looking for Jack or daniel, i found them both in the washroom taking meth hits off a small glass pipe.



 i was really getting fucked up at this point. crazy pattern visuals, breathing, and this was 5 minutes into my trip so i was very excited. All of a sudden Jack passed the pipe to me and I took a hit of meth.  I wouldnt have done this normally, speed was one of those drugs i really never wanted to try. but in my impaired state i didnt really have good judgement.  Jack at this point handed the pipe to daniel and told us he wanted to try to go to sleep. Daniel proceded taking more while i walked outside. Just before i walked outside i saw snakes all over the ground. and heard them. it was kind of like raiders of the lost arc where indiana jones is in the pit of snakes.



I thought if i can get through this my trip will be good so (probably looking like a total idiot ran) around the drive way with arms flailing, and after I returned to the house i felt like i was invincible. Neil, daniel and i decided to go on a walk. we walked to a small park where Neil started wigging out bellow the childrens swing set, in the middle of our conversation.  I then had the brilliant idea of trying rush. I had given the vial of rush to daniel to hold so i wouldn't break it while incapacitated on mushrooms.  so i had asked him to give me the bottle I took a hit and apparantly he had to grab it from my hands because i nearly dropped it. at first it felt like i was spinning around and around, then it felt like i was standing still and the world was spinning around me. very trippy.  



we returned to neil and jack's house, where i think daniel no longer was having any fun and decided to go home.  I think the mdma kicked in around then because i started feeling very very happy, and it felt like pleasure was pulsing through my body.  the closest thing that describes the feeling that i was having then was orgasms happening at different parts of my body, pretty cool. 



the next three hours Neil and i had really great conversations only interrupted by insane trips. the only ones i can remember are, i thought i was in a ferrarri flying through space smoking meth with god. i thought i was a flower whose only reason for existence was to play music with other flowers and each flower could only make one sound. Finally i thought i was having sex with the indian goddess shiva. Neil had a very similar experience.  Finally we noticed we were comming down and were both soo happy and content and talking about how it was the best trip of our lives.  We were sad that mushroom trip was leaving us but the comedown was very introspective and insightful, and quite pleasant. 



suprisingly we only felt mildly hungover the next day. A small price to pay for such a fantastic night.
