I found a few generic fiorinal capsules in the medicine cabnet. I think they were origionally my dad's for migranes but he stopped taking them because they didn't help much. I waited a few week until I could have a few hours to myself in case I did something stupid, and I took one of the pills. After about 45 minutes, I started feeling extremely euphoric. I felt as though everything that had been wrong in the world had gone right. This feeling intensified until I just could not stopp giggling.



After about 10 minutes of sitting online reading other people's experiences with this drug, I went outside to ride my bike. as I was going down the street, I noticed a slight drunk feeling but not enough to make me feel incapable of doing anything I couldn't do sober. As I write this report, the euphoria is still with me as strong as ever and I feel better than I have ever felt before in my entire life. This euphoria is much stronger than what I experience with marijuana or alcohol. Overall, I suggest trying this drug to anyone who has access to it.
