I've always gone to school high or drunk on different substances, but I'm going to tell you about my day at school on tramadol. I had six 50 mg pills (300 mg).



7:15 Am - Take 5 of the pills



7:20 Am - Arrive at school



8:00 Am - I start to get spacey, still feel pretty normal though



8:30 Am - I can feel a definite change as the pills start to kick in more. At this point I have an overall sense of well being. I decide to take the last pill for the hell of it.



9:00 Am - More of the body high kicks in, there's an overall euphoric feeling and it feels kind of like I'm floating. 



9:30 Am - This is a period change and when I walked through the halls with the crowd of people they were all pretty much a blur. Of course I had some techno in my headphones to go along with it.



9:30-11:30 Am - just a great feeling most similar to hydrocodone, the high peaked in this time and my vision started to get blurry and slow. Tramadol great for school because I can act pretty normal when needed but all I have to do is close your eyes for a second and I'll be on another planet.



11:30-12:30 - I can feel the high lessening and I start to get a little drowsy but in a dreamlike state, vision still blurred. 



12:30 - 2:00 PM - The comedown wasn't hard or anything left me feeling kind of refreshed which is awkward but hey who knows\ldots 



The rest of the day I could feel a small buzz from it. I even had a short conversation with the assistant principal and he thought I was a polite young man, ha.
