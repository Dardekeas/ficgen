 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



I started huffing in my H.S. art class\ldots of course rubber cement.

As I huffed with rubber cement I started to have auditory distortions like the sounds(voices,T.V. whatever)around me were pulsing and echoing at the same time. Then I got lightheaded,dizzy and almost like I was drunk. There is a little nasua and I could taste the chemical in my mouth. My mouth also POURS watery saliva. The high lasts about 5 min. then fades quickly.



I did this chemical for about 2 weeks 2-3 times a day.



Then I got a job at a wharehouse place. One night I noticed a can of areosol engine starter (you spray in in the carb aka ether). I read he can and it warned against inhaling the fumes(huffing). So I had to try it\ldots VERY stupid. 



I went to the bathroom and folded up one end of an empty toilet paper roll and put some t.p. in the bottom of it. As I sat on the toilet I sprayed the aerosol into the tube onto the toilet paper and started huffing. It was INTENSE,the auditory distortion of the MUZAC and the ceiling vent was very trippy. I was huffing for about 1.5 minutes with slow steady breaths through my nose. I remember saliva pouring out my mouth onto the floor between my feet. I was so out of it I almost fell of the pot\ldots the next thing I remember my boss was beating on the bathrooom door.



I woke up on the floor with the tube about a foot from my nose.

I stood up very woozy with a slight headache. My boss said I had been missing for 4 hours\ldots I had no explanation and was fired.

The memory of the whole episode with my boss is a blur but I can remember pieces.



I still think about what would have happened if the tube had landed closer to my nose after I had passed out.(DEATH) For the next couple of weeks(especially the next day)I felt dumbed down and not as sharp or `smart' as I was before this experience. Eventually my memory of my level of brain `sharpness' faded and the mind I have now is all I know\ldots but I do know that my mind was once different.



I did not know HOW serious huffing was until that experience. I NEVER have huffed and never will again. I know I killed many brain cells. It's NOT worth it,smoke a joint or have couple of beers.



Huffing is SERIOUS. PLEASE don't ever try it.
