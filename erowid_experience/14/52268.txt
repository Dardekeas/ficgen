I have used melatonin, 5-htp, and valerian on and off as an aid to my insomnia and depression. Also this is not the only time something like this has happened\ldots 



After a night of no sleep, Saturday morning I took a mega dose of melatonin and valerian with a normal dose of vitamin B6. The dreams I had after falling asleep were extremely vivid and included situations that were extremely realistic.



The dream that caused me to submit this report was that I was outside somewhere, in an unfamiliar place. There were two buildings and a grassy area between them. In this grassy area there were two groups of people\ldots  I was seeing this whole scene as if I was watching a movie. The two groups of people were conversing about something, it didn't seem as if they were arguing or anything. But all of a sudden I saw a close up of the rapper Deshaun Holton a.k.a. `Proof' as if a camera had zoomed in on him from the waste up. I heard a gunshot and simultaneously a gunshot wound ripped right through the middle of his forehead and I saw him falling back and to the side.



I wouldn't have submitted this report, but about 30 minutes ago I saw on MTV that proof was shot and killed at some club in Detroit. I don't know if it was the same kind of scenario or what but it really weirded me out. I don't know if it was the combo of pills or some gift I have or coincidence or what. But like I said, this isn't the only time something like this has happened after taking this combo. I just don't know what to make of it.



I'm going to continue taking the pills because they seem to be the only thing that helps me with my insomnia without drugging me up. But I dunno, I just found this to be extremely weird. 



\ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots Wow\ldots ..thats all I can keep saying to myself\ldots .. wow\ldots .
