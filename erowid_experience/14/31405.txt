I want my story to be heard, as I want the stories of all mental patients to be heard. 



In the fall of 1995(August, I believe), when I was a freshwoman in highschool, I started taking Paxil.  I weighed 154 lbs.  I was depressed, and it worked for me.  That, among other things like love and art, brought me out.  I stabalized at 20 mg a month or two after taking it.  I still went through rough patches (I gained 20 lbs.), but I did okay.  I felt like me.  Then I went to college, and life was wonderful, but challenging (down to 165 lbs.).  



Things started to get bad the tail end of Softmore year of college, Spring 2001.  I had gotten lice and shaved my head (I had long hair that I'd promised myself I'd never cut) and I stopped taking Paxil because I hated being tied to drugs and got fed up with the HMO doctors not being avialable.  



Junior year, Fall 2001, I moved off campus into a really depressing living situation.  Classes were really difficult, and I started getting panic attacks and insomnia.  I wondered if I was going crazy, like two of my female relatives both had - in their twenties, no less.  I was 20/21 at the time.  Just as bad, I had a friend that I had a messed up relationship with, and she was the one I hung out with the most.  Maybe we needed each other, in some twisted way.  I was also so anxious that I lost 10 lbs. in about 2 weeks, going from 165 to 155 lbs.



Things were hellish, and then, suddenly, they got wonderful.  Christmas break came, I started taking Paxil again, and I started seeing a new shrink.  Those changes helped give me the courage to get out of my bad living situation, and back on campus, which I loved.  Once there, I was so happy, and I met my bestfriend/ boyfriend Robbie, and I was so happy.  And so happy.  And so happy.  And so happy\ldots  For two weeks straight.  



In other words, I had a `manic episode.'  I was aware of cheerfuly driving myself into the ground.  I was also terrified of dying, and went to the emergency room twice.  I was anxious.  My Dad said all I needed was to relax and get a good night's sleep, but I couldn't.  Not after what I had just been through.  That fall I had been dragging and kicking and puching myself through life.  I couldn't just let go\ldots   



I was also on Paxil, which was helping to keep me in happy land.  At least, that's what I intuitively felt, and I now know you're not supposed to give Paxil to manic people.  But instead of just taking me off Paxil, the doctors decided to put me on something else \_in addition\_(That kinda pissed me off, and made me feel not listened to).  



That something was Saroquel, 2.5 miligrams if I remember correctly.  That did not go over well.  I went from manic to delusional in a heartbeat.  Really bad.  I had been somewhat delusional before, but that Saroquel, in trying to get me to sleep, just turned off my rational brain.  I can remember telling my Mom something like `It feels like I'm dreaming.'  And then It made me flashback to a nightmare I'd had when I was a little kid.  There was an evil lady I had to run away from\ldots  suffice to say, it didn't go over well with my Mom.  Or the police.



Things haven't really gotten that much better.
