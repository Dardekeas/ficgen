This substance is pretty potent. The effects are very clean and very cool. The dose I took brought me to a perfect level of consciousness. I am still able to think clearly yet the world is all bright and shiny. My thinking abilities just a little bit dimmed yet I am still able to function normally. There is no euphoria just a nice intoxication type feeling. This is like weed but without harsh smoke, smell, addictive euphoria, and the list goes on. I think that this substance would be a great medicinal alternative to anti-psychotics in my case due to its calming and relaxing effect (without the euphoria and body high). Extremely awesome substance that I hope never becomes illegal. 



My mix is as follows.



0.1 gram JWH-073

0.2 gram Menthol crystal

1.8 gram sodium bicarbonate



The resulting mix will prevent me from over dosing due to the menthol. The menthol adds a cooling effect to the mix and at the same time a slight burning if there is too much mix in the pipe. After the menthol starts to become more bearable the JWH-073 will vaporize. It looks like the Sodium Bicarbonate is vaporizing but it's really the JWH-073. The effects kick in quickly after I exhale the vapor (about a 45 second come up). The effects last about an hour.



The mass of the mix is slightly more than the mass of the JWH-073 (1.1 grams). The amount added to the pipe from the mix was very small. I would describe the amount as a threshold sized bump of a stimulant. Another way to put it would be little less than a half of a pea. Only a very small amount is needed! I didn't even vape all of it. After I took my first dose from the pipe I preformed a burn test. There was still quite a large amount of vapor pluming out of the pipe. The value of this substance is high. 



I only paid \$57.00 for this 1.1 grams and to my calculations there must be at least 200 doses left! If you do the math each dose costs a little over a twenty-five cents and the effects are equal to a small bowl of medical marijuana (without the addictive euphoria).
