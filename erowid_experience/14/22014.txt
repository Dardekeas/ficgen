For years I have suffered from minor anxiety to full-blown panic attacks. Over time, with study of my condition, energetic healing, therapy, exercise, meditation and the use of other self-prescribed medication, I have never found a med more effective than Alprazolam, or `XboX', as my circle refers to it.



I have been addicted to it in the past;

  addiction to benzo's sorta can sneak up on you.

To use this medication for treatment of anxiety, or recreationally, it is important not to let it run-away with you\ldots  be careful!

Coming down off it, especially cold turkey, of more than 2-4mg+ a day for more than 14 days can FUCK WITH YOU - like coming off speed addiction. Paranoia, MAJOR INSOMNIA, edgyness, dillusions, physical sickness, can't think straight, oversensitivity to senses and flu-like symptoms, fatigue, nightmares and tremors.



However, after a night on it, one can feel fantastic the next day, if used irregularly.



I find it grants me the exact opposite to many who descibe its effects; euphoria, body-highs*, empathy, extreme relaxation but no lost of motivation, increased comfortability in social situations, a clear-mind, no lose of motor control unless at about or over 6mg - sometimes a increase in creativity, clearer vision and joy.



Mixed with Alcohol, it is much more unpredictable, though can be extremely enjoyable, but can add for many the `snoozaline' effect.

However at high doses of both, one can become almost `zombielike', with no recollection of events that they partook in, sometimes dangerous, sometime boring for those around them as `short-term memory' can go TO HELL, and one can become unco-ordinated and participate in acts they have no recollection or control over.



I find it takes the psychotropic edge of marijuana, making it more sedative.



I find it completely destroys MDMA experiences, taking away the strength of the pill and the magic.



I find that it minimises the effects of true entheogens (LSD, mushrooms).



Mixed with amphetamine it can cause any interesting up/down synergism. It makes coming down off stimulants a breeze!



It is LESS euphoric than Diazepam, lasts about twice as long, is stronger and it's smoother. I have tested this extensively, but maybe IT'S JUST ME.



Be Safe, but the `XboX' can be WONDERFUL if treated with respect.



Happy Doc-Shopping,

  and weigh up your irresponsibility(fun)

    with your responsiblity(care)

Benny Dubbers
