Like a few posts in this forum, I agree that many of these experiences were not actual experiences of the true effects of ether.  I say this because when I first did it I got the headspins and the scattered vision and the reverberations in my head, but I didn't have the quantity to go on a proper binge.  I thought what I felt was what ether did but how that did change when I got my hands on around half a litre of the shit.  I would casually do one or two generously soaked rags a day for just under a week.  But the only binge I went on was the most intense experience of my life.  



The rumor is that when Johnny Depp was researching the character of Raoul Duke for Fear and Loathing, he asked Hunter S. Thompson what the effects of ether felt like (considering he'd never done it before).  Hunter replied `It's like drinking 23 bottles of wine in 5 seconds.'  That's the best description I've heard for a proper ether high (if you can call it a high).  I had a fair bit left in the bottle so I decided to pour very liberal amounts onto my rag.  My first rag, I was paralysed and convinced there was a someone standing behind me with a huge knife who was seconds away from slashing me to pieces (even though my back was to a wall).  I've never been so scared in my life nor will I ever be that scared again.  That feeling was the definition of terror, but strangely it wasn't that bad, I'd never felt so alive.  Of course all the standard effects were in play too (Couldn't move, face numb, those deathly reverberations) but the really memorable effects were the mindfucks.  Every rag I had after that spawned a different epiphany, most of which I cannot remember.  



Ether does that, for around 30 - 60 seconds on most rags I experienced enlightenment, then as quickly as it came to me it disappeared without a trace (I would have written them down but I couldn't move).  On one rag it was as though God had personally chosen me out of every human that had ever lived to know what the meaning of life was, and he told me and I was dumbfounded, then 30 seconds later he took it away from me.  I'm sure it wasn't the meaning of life but it was damn close.  Crazy shit like that happened over and over and eventually I was running low on the ether, this is when it started to go bad.  I said I'd do one more rag then head inside because I felt like my sinus' were soaked in the stuff.  I did the rag, got the mindfuck, started to come down then started to feel incredibly nauseous, like no sickness I'd felt before.  I somehow made it into the toilet and yacked like I've never yacked before.  Vomit was coming out of my mouth with incredible force and spraying all over the inside of the bowl, it didn't feel natural at all.  After about 5 minutes of vomiting I think it would have been, I blacked out. I woke up with my head at the back of the toilet and my legs crumpled up against the wall (very small toilet).  I was still so fucked from the ether though that I couldn't move and couldn't see properly.  



After about another 10 minutes I managed to pick myself up from the floor and stumble outside for fresh air.  About 20 minutes after that I was back to base-line and had time to properly reflect on the experience.  The effects of ether are incredible, but it has to be one of the most dangerous drugs we know about.  It is a mindfuck and I don't understand how people can sit around and do this together and call it fun.  I know now this drug can very easily kill a person but in my opinion, like most drugs, if I am just be careful with it you'll enjoy it.
