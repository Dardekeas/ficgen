I take Vyvanse regularly on a daily basis.  40 Mg of the stimulant in the morning has me going alert and efficient till about 5 in the afternoon.  I also take Klonopin to counter my anxiety and sleep problems. I usually take a .5 mg tablet in the evening everyday.  



Today I woke up like any normal day.  Took my vyvanse at about 7, and around 8:30 I was up and about doing homework and other things.  Around noon time I suddenly felt pain in the back of my neck, and over a period of ten minutes the pain turned into extreme stiffness and my head and shoulders were left in an awkward cocked position. I took some ibuprofen (600 mg) mainly for the pain and the anti-inflammatory effects, I prefer Tylenol but acetaminophen doesn't have anti-inflammatory.



The pain didn't go away nor did the dis figuration.  Around 4:30 I came home and had a bottle of tramadol 50 mg each from a surgery earlier this year.  The bottle said `take two pills every 6 hours as needed for pain.'  I took three, simply because I was in a lot of pain and I felt that 150 mg of tramadol isn't really dangerous.  It felt good, I experienced reduced pain and I was feeling more relaxed and a little light headed.  The pain killing effect lasted till about 10 o'clock.



My neck began hurting pretty unbarebly again around 10, so I took two more tramadol.  This time the 100 mg dose was very obvious.  I felt very good.  The pain killing effect was excellent, and I even felt a little more buzzed almost like a high euphoric feeling.  I normally take .5 mg of klonopin around 9, but I didn't because I didn't want it to interact with the tramadol.  I am aware, however, that klonopin has a very long half life, and I have taken it for several months every night and surely I have a good amount still in my bloodstream.  



I got in bed around 11.  After looking at the ceiling for a few minutes due to being light headed and worry free I noticed my breathing was a little slower than normal.  In fact, I was breathing very shallow and needed to manually take big breaths to feel like I was actually taking in air.  After a few more minutes I kind of dozed off and was abruptly awakened by myself to gasp for a breath.  It scared me and I tried keeping my eyes open to focus on my breathing and not let it happen again.  About 20 minutes later my phone went off and I again woke up when I heard it and gasped for a breath, I have no idea when I fell asleep.



It is now 1:45 in the morning my time.  I keep getting into bed and finding breathing difficult and am scared I could stop breathing altogether in my sleep since sleep lowers your respiration rate as well.  I have to keep getting up to breathe properly, which isn't fun because my neck still hurts if I move around too much.  To keep myself awake I decided to get on here and write this experience.  I feel like I could get back into bed in the next 10 or 15 minutes and breath normally, but I don't know how I will be when I am asleep.  Frankly I'm a little scared to fall asleep.  I know tramadol is meant to be a mild mimic of opiates, but I have never taken it other than this time and after the surgery.



Overall I enjoyed the buzzed feeling, but never again will I take the tramadol this late at night.  I am writing this while awake, avoiding sleep.  I don't want to fall into coma, or worse death.  Maybe I'm overreacting, but better safe than sorry especially when dealing with pharmaceuticals.
