This was a while ago. I was messing with a brainwave generator that played sounds, most of them either give me a headache or make me feel different but I was messing with the settings trying to make one for Out of Body. About 2 months later I finally found sound settings that worked for me.



I remember laying on my bed forever with eyes closed thinking nothing would happen. About 10 minutes of listing to that horrid sound I started to feel `different' And my feet started to tingle. Eventually it ran up my body and into my head. It felt like pressure on my body but it felt really good. I felt what I thought was a hand on my chest and I quickly snapped out of it kinda freaked out. 



I continued to lay there the sound made me sleepy even though I was awake from taking coffee earlier that day. Closing my eyes felt so good for some reason. About 10 minutes after I closed my eyes again I started to get that feeling again but this time I wanted to see what happened and not `freak out' I remember opening my eyes because my body felt so good. To me it was better then the body high from MDMA. The body high was very strong even though I opened my eyes. It felt good to wrap my furry blanket around me as I continued to listen to to ever growing enjoyable sound.



I don't know when it happened but some time during that body high that I was enjoying I was staring at my light everything around the light darkened and started to take shape. I was transported to where I use to live and I saw the refridgerator open. I walked up to it and closed the door but the light still remained. I turned around and looked out the window but all I could see was that light, I then heard a strange noise and snapped back to reality. It was my sister opening my bedroom door asking about that sound.

 

For a while after I have tried to get the same effect from that sound but with little or no luck. This experience was one of a kind that I wish I could have finished. I'm sure that if I tried it longer like I did that time. 



I've tried a 3rd plateau of DXM with that sound and have had good results except that sometimes the experiences are too emotionally intense. I have woken up from an OoBE completely in tears unable to stop myself from crying a couple of times.
