Upon finding and foraging amanita muscaria var. formosa mushrooms in my area, I decided to concoct an admixture of the mushrooms with the leaves of a brugmansia plant.  I had previously used the brugmansia plant in ayahuasca, and decided to pay homage to the plant by using it this time in mushroom tea.



I took one dried orange fly agaric mushroom, which weighed about 1 gram, and three and a half dried brugmansia leaves, about a half gram of plant material, and decocted the substances twice, each time in solutions of about 1 part lemon juice 3 parts water.  The yield was about a cup of yellow potion, which went down easily.  



Soon after ingesting the brew, I noticed definite tropane alkaloid / muscimol-ibotenic acid stimulation.  I felt almost drunk, but experienced more dreamy K-like sedation, with mild hallucinations.  Also, my pupils were immensely dilated, and I felt a sense of pseudo-power, which is typical of amanita intoxication.  The voyage lasted for about five hours, after which I fell into a deep sleep.  The only negative side-effects I experienced were an extreme case of cottonmouth.  



The admixture of brugmansia/datura plants and fly agaric mushrooms could conceivably be used to yield a variety of Soma-like potions.  I suggest using the most careful methods in identification when foraging and the most cautious dose controls to avoid poisoning.  Use your heads!  With the right people involved, we could se a whole Soma resurgence movement.
