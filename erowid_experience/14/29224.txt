I tried my own concotion, having just gotten home from the local herb store. I had already taken 1mg of Ativan for anti anxiety, prescribed by my doctor, then decided to make a tea concoction with wormwood as a base.  I have a wonderful clay teapot so I started loading up the pot with herbs and boiling some water.  



About 5:30 pm, I poured 12 oz. of boiling water into the teapot which contained 1tsp. Catnip, 1tsp. Valerian, 1tsp. St. John's Wort, 1/2 tsp. Kava, and added 1/2 oz. of Kava tincture Wild Oats' brand\ldots (in grain alcohol) to the mix to `develop' the Wormwood, then decided to add one mint/triple Ginseng teabag so it wouldn't taste nasty.  



While this was steeping for 25 minutes, I had a couple cigarettes and took a centrum performance vitamin with 50mg standardized Panax Ginseng and 60 mg. Ginkgo (also standardized).  



T+0:00 

The tea is ready and it looks like green skim milk! I added 6 teaspoons of sugar so I could stomach this nasty concotion.  by 6:15 I had chugged the whole cup of tea. Glad that's over!  



T+0:30

Feeling better now that I'm having a pepsi to get that horrible, did I mention HORRIBLE taste out of my mouth, I feel lightheaded, seeing slight trails on everything when I move my head and I also feel happy that I'm writing this! I was in a good mood prior to drinking the substance and now feel like I'm in the best f\#@king mood ever!  I feel a light buzz and everything feels really GOOD!!! As I continue to drink my pepsi, the feelings seem to keep getting more intense.  



Focusing on the computer screen, it seems fluid and as if it were moving from side to side, kinda trippy, oh yeah and I forgot to mention that I take 100mg. Trazodone nightly to sleep and as an anti-depressant\ldots as well as 2mg. of Ativan per day.  I also had a bunch of coffee in the hours prior to going shopping for herbs.



T+0:38 

Just took my 2nd mg. of Ativan for the day.  Still feeling buzzed and ultra relaxed.  Everything seems to have gotten quiet, like I'm so at peace inside my suddenly very comfortable to be in apartment, no music is playing just the clicking of the keys, when I look at the computer screen and then at something else like my static-x poster, the lines image that's on the computer screen seems to be superimposed on the dark parts of the poster, very strange, it's also there for quite some time when I close my eyes, it undulates and then dissipates. I feel very excited yet relaxed at the same time, everything I look at feels like I'm looking at it for the first time, not to mention the `floating' glow from the computer screen that is still there.



T+1:15

Ok so I thought maybe more would happen but I'm not complaining, still getting some sick visuals but they come and go, I feel happy and kinda `stoned,' so my concotion turns out to just be really relaxing and only slightly hallucinogenic, now I have the munchies.
