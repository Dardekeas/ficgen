I purchase 3 hits of DOI against the advice of my dealer, who says its best to take only 1 hit. He said it would last 16 hours, and I laughed thinking, `This hippy is trying to talk it up'. I ingest 3 hits and go to a drum circle.



T+1:00 

No effects



T+2:00 

Slight Euphoria, but the `feeling' came to me, the feeling I gets when I know tripping shall occur



T+3:00-4:00

Heavy Euphoria, body high.. I ride in a car home from the gathering, and it is fantastic\ldots  I arrive back to my house, there I contemplate the meaning of 16 hours\ldots  for some reason I believe him now.. and it begins\ldots I'm very freaked out because I am staying with my parents and I don't have a car at the time.. no where to go, nothing to do\ldots  I try to sleep. Nothing. I get more and more freaked out and now every time I close my eyes I hear terrible quality reggaeton music and see various images of skulls, fire, and other such demonic things. Then I quit trying to sleep.



T+4:00-6:00 

I watch Curly Sue with a renewed interest. It was fantastic, wonderful, excellent. Haha. I laughed and rejoiced.



T+7:00-8:00 

I foolishly try to trick my self into sleeping and all of the aforementioned symptoms occur again. In the same intensity.



T+8:00-10:00 

I watch Father of the Bride and it likewise was seeming one of the best movies ever. 



T+10:00-16:00 

I try to sleep, now I cant really express to sort of hell I'm experiencing now, all of the same things but I try to battle them. I try to pray and when I pray I see with closed eyes arrows shooting out into oblivion and exploding. I want to cry but I don't. I just keep going through the same things. I'll have moments of peace soon after I convince myself that God will put me to sleep, little did I know, he certainly wouldn't. 



T+16:00-20:00 

I feel bad, like I had a bad trip all night and didn't sleep. I watch TV and try to eat, which isn't pleasant.



The next day, I feel like crap and my eyes are dilated, this doesn't end for 2 days.

 

Overall, it sucked and I wouldn't do it again, and I am not an inexperienced Psychonaut either, I don't know what it was that happened to make me think like I did, but I just wouldn't do it again.
