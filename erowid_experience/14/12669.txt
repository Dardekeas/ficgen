Me and my roomie had never heard of AMT before the night we decided to try it with a bunch of people from our college. It was described to us as a mix of rolling and acid (the `candy flip' as it was lovingly referred to). Since we are both pretty open minded individuals we decided to give it a whirl.  We took the pill at about 9 PM and then proceeded to go out and check out some parties on campus.



After about an hour of hanging out I began to feel a little `weird'.. it reminded me a little of the onset of E, but not quite the same at all. I basically couldnt describe it. I noticed my pupils becoming extremely dialated. My room mate was not yet feeling anything. After another hour we all seemed to be tripping pretty hard in `waves'. We likened it to that because it seemed to constantly creep in on us in a somewhat of a rush sensation.. then decline and then come back even harder.. It was very intense, but extremely interesting and almost put us in a state of `awe'. We all enjoyed painting with watercolors immensely and afterward seemed to stare at them for hours and watch the lines move and the different colors interact. This was not maybe 5 hours into our long( about 10-12 hour) trip.

 

The unfortunate part of my trip is that I happen to have an extremely sensitive, weak stomach. For the last 4 hours of the trip I could not stop throwing up.. I would throw up and afterward for like 5 minutes feel amazing and this incredible release, but\ldots  then the nausea would again take me over and I would continue to vomit. This made the last end of the trip a little rough and hard to bare at times because no one really wants to be throwing up in that mindset. I rode it out though and definately enjoyed the majority of the experiece.. it was intense, but not over powering. The last time I threw up would be the 5 pm the next day. I do not recommend this for anyone who is prone to stomach problems.
