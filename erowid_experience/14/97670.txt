It was the summer of 2008 and I was a 19 year old college student at the time. Having been very into spirituality and esotericism since first stumbling upon and reading Manly P Hall's `Secret Teachings of All Ages' a few years prior, I was extremely interested in the nature of reality and perception. So, by extension, I was very intrigued by the idea of psychonautics.



During this time I was a casual drug user but my psychedelic experiences were mainly limited to psilocybe mushrooms and marijuana. Over the that summer, I must have tripped 7-8 times and enjoyed every moment of it. A couple of these experiences were on 2c-b because at the time a friend had a large supply of 2c-b in 100mg capsules. Anyhow, after having having tripped a total of 10-12 times, I felt like I was `experienced' enough to try to `explore my mind.'



Being 19, I was dumb and recklessly confident. I decided to consume 200mg of the 2c-b\ldots  at \emph{home} about an hour after dinner (around 9pm). This was also the first time I'd tripped by myself. About 30-40 minutes later, I started to get that pre-trip sensation and reality started wavering. I was excited and as the trip started to come on a little bit stronger, I decided to take a hit from my bong in the bathroom to maximize the experience (mistake). I packed up a small bowl and took a giant hit and held it in for a little bit, because I wanted to get the most out of the hit.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



The moment I exhaled, I began to trip 1000x times harder, and at that moment I realized I was in for more than I bargained for. I was already tripping massive balls, and I knew that I was still on the come up, so things were only going to get more intense. I hid my bong and went into my room.



Going to my room seemed like forever when in fact my bathroom was connected to my room. I had a series of thoughts during this where at first I panic-thought that I might be dying, but then I was able to remind myself that I was tripping and it would all be over in 5-6 hours. Colors began melting into each other and every sensation was incredibly intense. My mind was racing uncontrollably at a million thoughts per second.



I sat on my bed and tried to listen to music. I put on Grateful Dead's American Beauty album, which would normally put me into a state of calmness and happiness during a trip. However, this time, the music was incredibly intense to me and my sensory inputs could not handle it, as each lyric or musical phrase would spawn a thousand individual thoughts in my head that I could not keep up with. So I turned it off, laid down and lied down on the bed and tried to keep calm. I closed my eyes, but the sound of the air conditioner vent humming started to drive me mad so I got up and turned off the A/C. But then the silence was even worse. After what felt like hours, I looked at the clock: it was 10:30.



This really put me into a bad thought loop and I desperately needed some form of reassuring physical human contact as I was drifting off into madness, so I got up and walked to my parents' room. My parents were in bed watching tv, and I walked up without saying a word, and face-planted into the bed in between them. My mom asked me what I was doing, and I quickly snapped into the realization that what I was doing was completely weird and tried to play it off. `Oh, I was just coming to let you guys know that I turned the A/C off,' I told them. My parents looked at me quizzically and were basically like, uhhmm okay thanks for letting us know? I got up and walked back to my room.



The trip was still incredibly intense at this time, as it was only 11:00 or so, and I laid down in my bed and tried to get a grasp on things, thoughts still moving at light speed. Every object that I would look at would spawn a million thoughts regarding it. Where did it come from? How was it made? How did someone come up with the idea to make this? Who was the first person who thought this was a good idea?



By this time everything in my visual perception was fluid and constantly flowing and melting. It made me think of the movie `A Scanner Darkly' and soon I began to think that I was in the movie. I'm not sure if you are familiar with the movie/book, but in one scene a character named Freck tries to kill himself, so he lies in his bed and pops a bottle of downers and wine. However, he was ripped off and was sold a hallucinogen instead and laid in bed while a monster from between dimensions read him all of his sins for all of eternity. I felt like I was Freck as I lied in bed, everything whirling and flowing around me, and time was passing incredibly slow. During this time, I thought about pretty much everything I did wrong with my life, my relationships, my friends, my education, etc, and then concluded that I should never to do drugs again (failed resolution).



At about 2 or 3AM I started to panic again and I tried to call the friend who sold it to me, because I wanted to know when it would end. He didn't answer, so I left him a message, which later he would make fun of me for (I said some stupid things haha). Anyhow, I somehow was able to calm myself when I found a magazine on my nightstand, specifically Harper's Bazaar, and began reading it. For some reason, reading this magazine really soothed me and was taken in by the artful pictures within and their crisp colors. I did this for the next 2 hours or so, until it was about 5AM, when the trip finally subsided to the point where I was able to think fairly coherently. When this happened, I was overcome with this incredibly cathartic sense of accomplishment: I had survived the trip and came out with valuable personal insight! Hurray! I felt at peace with the world and myself and started to drift to sleep while recounting the experience. The next day, I felt a pleasant light afterglow.



I'd say that the experience as a whole was very positive, due to the ending and the catharsis. I honestly believe that it made me become a better person, it made me look at myself from outside of my own perspective, if that makes any sense. It was as if I were some other entity looking at my human self, her character, and her flaws. 



Would I do this again? NOPE! Never tripped by myself since, HAH!
