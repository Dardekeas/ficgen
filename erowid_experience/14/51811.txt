I consider myself as having a pretty high tolerance for all kinds of drugs -(Except Salvia -- THAT STUFF KICKED MY BUTT!!!), and these resins that I smoked really did not do a whole lot for me except make me tired.  



First of all, I ordered both from an Internet source that I will not mention that sent the wild dagga resin in a small plastic zip lock baggie.  I had to cut the baggie to get to the sticky stuff, and even then, it got all over everything (kinda like smoking bowl resin out of the elbow -- the really sticky gooey stuff).  Anyway, I FINALLY got enough in the bowl to smoke and I had to put ashes in the bottom of the bowl because otherwise the resin would have just dripped all down in the bowl.  I took about 5-6 hits and it really tasted like crap.  I did not really feel any different than my usual stonedness, except my eyes did not feel dry.  



Then, after about 30 minutes, I decided to try the blue lotus stuff.  This was packaged better because the resin was wrapped in wax paper and was not so gooey.  It had more of a hash consistency to it.  I again put ashes in the bottom of the bowl and put the blue lotus resin on top.  I hit that about 5-6 times.  It was not as harsh as the wild dagga, but harsh nonetheless.  After that, the only thing that I really noticed was that the TV looked more 3D.  I felt kind of floaty, but I definitely prefer a good ole fashioned MJ buzz to either one of these.  After that, I went to bed early because my lungs felt too tight to smoke any MJ -- kinda the feeling in the lungs that I have after tripping acid all night.  Perhaps these herbs are better left to those who practice meditation and that sort of thing.  It is supposed to help one think clearly.  I don't know\ldots 



I wouldn't waste my time on wild dagga and blue lotus.
