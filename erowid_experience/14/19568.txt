It all started when my brother (aka I) and his new wife (aka J) and myself got back to our parents house.  I had already taken 2 Valiums about 30 min before we got there and I didn't really feel anything, yet.  After about an hour J and myself decided to take 2 more Valium.  By this time I was feeling extremely euphoric and numb.  To my suprise my mom started talking about when she used to smoke weed, and do all kinds of drugs, then she mentioned she has a few Lorcets and asked if we wanted one.  After taking it, J and I went outside to smoke a joint (\$60 1/8 Dank).  My other brother came outside with a video camera (SOB) so we put out the joint and smoke the rest in a gravity bong, later.  By this time I couldn't walk, talk, or pretty much do anything but lay on the floor while my nephew (6 years old) started trying out wrestling moves on me.  



I didn't mind because I couldn't feel him drop kicking me or elbow dropping, anyway.  At about 3:00 A.M everbody was asleep except J and myself.  Anyway we finished the weed and I don't remember going to sleep but I remember waking up like 18 hrs later.  All in all it was a great experience, but the fact that my family was there for me and wanted to trip out with me made it EASILY the most special and greatest feeling of my life.
