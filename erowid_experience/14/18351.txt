This is to report a strange and scary `sensation?', that i and my girlfriend experienced on our first major syrian rue experiment.



We had been trippin for a good 3 hours or so, having not eaten 12 hours before and only lightly the previous day.  Obeyed all the food restrictions, but the trip had a very low feel.  I got up to get us water and was up for about a minute when, bringing the water back, my vision slowly filled with black from the bottom up and i suddenly felt very dizzy.  I quickly put the water down and said to Kc (my girl) that i was very dizzy and quickly sat down.



Just as i sat down i had a strange pulling feeling almost like a HUGE!!! headrush, but what happened next is what is really startling.  As the headrush increased my mind fragmented into complete and utter confusion?, panic?, negativity? I though holy shit it's happening, what? im not sure but something bad. I then visualized infinity and with deep calming breaths brought my mind back before I was completely lost.



An hour or so later my girl got up to take a pee and i heard a loud crash in the bathroom, I ran in to see kc on the floor with the towel hanger ripped off, and she was lying in the corner with a look of confusion equal to what i had felt and i knew it was happening to her too!  I went to talk to her and she wasn't responding, she then started to twitch a little (looked almost like a seizure?) and I immediately held her and whispered things like `it's ok im right here' `it's not really happening' `concentrate on my voice' and in a couple of seconds recognition dawned on her face but it took a while for her to recover but after a while we went back to the couch.



One thing i forgot to mention is that we both vomited about 5min after the experience.  So in conclusion I would say it was almost what a seizure would be like although both me and kc have never had seizures and there's no record of them in our families, so i can't say for sure.  But what i learned from the whole experience is: MAOs OR WHATEVER THEY ARE, ARE THERE FOR A REASON SO UNLESS PREPARING AN AYAHUASCA BREW DONT USE SYRIAN RUE TO ENHANCE SUBSTANSES LIKE MUSHROOMS\ldots .JUST EAT MORE MUSHROOMS!



Syrian rue really ruined the whole experience with what felt like a chemically induced depression\ldots .maybe from harmaline? But after the mind fuck incident i went inside and came out with a sense of enlightenment that brought a inner calm to counterbalance the confusion of the whole trip.
