I was given Risperidone as a `mood stabiliser' after becoming bipolar.  Initially I was in a mental health ward and I noticed a few affects right away.  I was playing chess on a palm pilot and the game seemed to slow up and speed down.  It wasn't actually the game slowing down and speeding up it was what I believe to have been my `conceptualisation' of the game.  I would feel a build up of expectation when having made a move to the move which would be made in response by the chess program.  Then it seemed to flip and I would have a build up of expectation of making my own move and then release.  It was a build up of tension which seemed to be linear in response to the game I was playing.  Then I noticed that I was salivating while eating.  Also I was eating as I could only describe at the time and did relay to the pyschiatric doctors `like a cat'.  I was eating with ravenous hunger.  Mealtimes were hellish.  



I was then released from the mental ward and allowed to go home.  They had given me a course of risperidone consta which is a 25mg shot that lasts two weeks.  They did not trust me to take the drug in pill form.  I got back to my abode and automatically started drinking (a bottle of whisky).  Halfway through the following morning I woke up - I was freezing cold.  I ran a hot bath and put the heating on.  I spent the next two days wrapped in blankets next to a heater and I could not get warm.  I did not feel heat.



I had to phone the mental health people to tell them of my situation.  They got back to me after a few hours and said that I was having a `physiological reaction' which meant that I thought hot was cold and cold was hot from what I understand this can be a concept.  The feeling of cold was accenuating my arthritic pains.  They took me back onto the ward.



During the next week due to the addition of drugs I know not what the problem with hot and cold went away.  They kept me on Risperidone, 25mg every 2 weeks.  Then I felt that my whole body was slowing down.  I was playing a lot of table tennis in there.  I felt that the arthritis was giving me real problems and I seemed to be reacting a lot slower to stop or pre-empt any pain.  Then I noticed my speech started to get slurred.  Then I noticed that everyone elses speech was slurred (including the nurses).  Eventually I was let out.



I found I could not relax.  For 15 weeks after that I was in the situation where I could not sleep I was permanently pacing (all day) and I was becoming severely depressed.  I ended up with suicidal ideation (every waking minute).  At this time I was telling the psychiatrist who was prescribing me this drug that I was not getting well at all on it.  He told me that I would be on it for years he said that all the symptoms I was having were due to my bipolar disorder and not the risperidone.  Eventually I got to the stage where I tried to kill myself.  Luckily I failed.  Very soon after that I phoned up those people again and said I am really Ill and having problems I must be re-admitted.  I was still eating like a cat my speech was effected but now It was just me (sounding like a dummy).  I was having a real crisis of confidence.  



Thats it.  I think the sequence of events can be expanded a bit I try not to think of those days.  When they finally let me out again I was still suicidal.  Also I can remember if I got too relaxed I would wake up with a twitch I was twitching constantly in my sleep which would halt it.  One other thing that I can remember happening in the midst of all that which makes me realise what risperidone does to me - It's used as a mood stabiliser so it will make my emotions go one way or another.  I remember telling a friend who was round at my abode I can't cry and then I started crying.  I felt some release in just bawling my eyes out for a time then I stopped crying.  The few hours after stopping crying I experienced the worst depression I have ever experienced I got really black depression.  It was the way the drug works.  It doesn't allow me to have extremes of emotion.  If I do actually have an emotional extreme it will counteract heavily in the opposite direction.  When I cry I am happy to be crying, I felt some release in tears.  It bit me back.  After a few weeks the Risperidone got out of my system and I started feeling better.  They prescribed me seroquel instead which is extremely sedating.



Now I feel completely fine that is the drug for me.  I explained at one stage I remember to the psychiatrist that sleep is something you learn to do, I felt I had lost the idea of how to sleep and that Is why I was suicidal.  I was convinced I would never get well again.  I remonstrated with this psychiatrist at least once - I said these atypical antipsychotics come with a list of side effects and also details of the dose etc.  Not much information at all.  I said that these drugs must come with an understanding, an explanation of how they will effect your mind and what physiological effects are.  I am convinced that If I had not had relatives who were medically astute and this information had not been relayed to me I may never have got over it.  That bad phase of my life.  I would say that for me at least it was a very dangerous drug.
