40 yr old male, has done shrooms, LSD, about 20 x pot, pills that's about it. 



One evening two buddies arrived at my door asking if I wanted to smoke a bowl.  We went in and I was handed the pipe fist and told to `hit it hard' so I did.  As soon as I exhaled,  I was in another world.  I remember them running out the door and leaving me!  I had just enough conscience left to realize it was not pot and they had played a dangerous joke. (I would NEVER give anyone ANY substance w. out their prior knowledge and consent) I made it from the garage into the house where apparently I hit the floor and did the `fish', then jumping up I had the overwhelming urge to run, but not straight, to the LEFT and I began running around the outside of my house in left turns abrading my skin and bleeding from the stucco walls.  I pleaded with my mom and dad to tell me who I was and who were they?  They called an ambulance and I quickly came down with a most peaceful and tranquil feeling at the hospital. I would never try such a drug again ( maybe much less )
