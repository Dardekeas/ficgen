Sorry for my bad english. Hope you'll get my meanings tho!



At that time I didn't use anything else than cannabis, tho I started to experience different drugs, like MDMA, LSD, amphethamine etc.. Now I've tried soo many different drugs and appreciate them more, after this one intense experience! :D



So, one of my bf's friends came to us and told that he had something strong and 

good blotters, and because I tried LSD the first time just a week before this and I liked it, we decided to try this one too. First, he said that it was LSD what has a mescaline on it, and I was really excited. I took a half of the blotter, so did everyone else too. 



After an half hour, because I didn't feel the effects and now I don't remember how 

did it even taste, we decided to take another half and placed it under our tongue.



THEN he said, that it takes more time than usually to feel the effects, and some of

people called it `bromo-dragonfly'. So I did my research at the internet, and noticed that it wasn't mescaline, it wasn't even LSD. I got a bit scared, but at the same time more excited. I remember one thing he said before the trip: `don't fall asleep, it's the most important'.



After like 3 hours, we all started to feel the effects. I don't remember maybe correctly because the whole trip were so strong and intense, but I do remember that I was laying on the bed, while others watching a movie. I tried to open my eyes, but it seemed so hard to keep them open so I had the most coolest closed-eye-visuals. Sounds of the movie came to my trip and at the same time my friends kept pushing me to keep my eyes open and not to fall asleep. I remember that my bf was really scared for me, and I remember when I said something like `I don't care if I die, I feel so good. So let me keep my eyes closed'. They didn't let me. 



Time passes by, and after maybe +5 hours I started to come back from the rush, I was able to keep my eyes open again. But I kept `falling' in the closed-eye-visuals over and over again, while my bf panicing about me and how I'm doing. Now I'm grateful that they kept talking to me and keeping me awake. 



I don't really remember even 1/3 of the trip, it lasted like 72 hours. There were good things, and actually just 2 bad things;



1. 2'nd day, one of our friends came from the bar to say hello to us. I was in my bed, just watching, while others talking. Suddenly, I had this weird thought, `I'm going crazy, all these people are crazy, soon they'll kill me!!!!'. It lasted 5sec, then I got back and relaxed.



2. 3'rd day, it was morning, everyone else was asleep, me still awake and trying to sleep. I was so close to fall asleep, but then I heard a BIG snap in my head, and got scared for my brains! I got up, and noticed that I'm 100\% sober, the trip were over. I got to the bathroom ( it was hard to even walk on the whole trip, so this was like 2'nd time in the bathroom for 3 days), looked myself on the mirror, and notices that my right pupil was reaaally big and left one normal. Or maybe I was still tripping and thought so\ldots  

So I went to the kitchen to take a glass of water, and when I turned to the window, I saw snow everywhere, but it was all red and shiny. I got near the window and sat there like 20minutes tho I believed I was in there for 2 minutes.. 



Then I realized that I'm still tripping badly and I need to get to the bed before my legs starts to feel too heavy to move again.



I don't really remember that much of the trip, but it was reaaally good, without the guys with me in there, it would have been on a really bad trip, but they were all so kind and I felt the love and thoughts between us just by looking in someone's eyes, I had the most coolest trip ever, and still thinking that way.. Even tho I'll never try BDFL again. I could just imagine how that ends to a bad trip, and `cause it lasts 3 days ( or those blotters do), it's not a toy to play with, and could be hard to get back to the right road again.



AND I don't know what would have happen, if they wouldn't keep me awake while the biggest rush were on. In one time, I remember that every closed-eye-visuals got away, and it placed with darkness, and nothing. Then someone slapped me and I got back. I don't know if I was near to passing out or not, but I felt like I was. 



Yup, be careful what you take, and how much.
