Oa friday night, a bunch of us got together in my old neighboorhood. We are sitting in the park when one of the local dealers walks buy, we put our money together and buy around 5/8 of an ounce. That night there were a couple of us around, about 7 of us. Soo we smoke between ourselves about 1/8 of an ounce, and save the rest for the next day. We all go our own ways, and meet up the next day very early, at about 11 in the morning. Now there is only 4 of us, myself, and my close friends M, J, and B. B had taken all of the weed home that night and rolled it all into 4 nicely rolled joints, fancy, one for each of us.



Last night, the weed didnt seem to be that strong, it gave a nice, mellow high, but nothing more, no deep thoughts or anything like that. Soo we all light up in the same park that we had been in the evening before, right down the street from my old house. Seeing as how I have an unusually low tolerance to weed, I shoulda been high, but I wasnt, I felt nothing, all I felt was very nervous and very anxious, but nothing else.



I decide to take a walk, everyone else is high, and I dont even have a buzz yet. I take about 3 steps and BAM, I was knocked right to the ground. Everything was spinning, and I didnt understand what was going on, I had never felt this way before, I couldnt think, understand or interpret a single thing, everything was a blur. About a half hour passes of me just sitting there, I finally get some sence of reality and realise that my buddies are all talking on a cell phone.



I grab it and start talking, it was my friend, G. G tells us to meet her at a coffee shop down the road. We walk there, taking our time. I sit down, and this is where everything turned wierd. I looked outta the side window at the building to the side, the building where all my friends went to smoke during their lunch break. Many thoughts swarmed through my head, first came my friend, A, who had just recently gotten into a very serious accident, I thought about everything that was going on in my life, all my friends, school, and then my family, my mother in particular, I couldnt stop thinking about my mom, thinking about how much she did for me, how much I took her and the rest of my family for granted, and life, everything.



I then started to feel really sick, my head was pounding, I felt like everything was pushing against my body, I hate the feeling, it was one of the worst experiences of my life. And worst of all, my friends were gone. I sit there, trying to calm myself down, just then, J walks into the coffee shop, with a popsicle. One lick was all I needed, the sweet, cold treat felt soo good. I begged him for another lick, and he said that he would buy me one. We went outside, and he walked into the convenience store beside the coffee shop, buys it, and gives it to me. I open it up and start eating away. He tells me that he was going to snort some ketamine, but this popsicle was too good, plus I was never a real fan of chemicals.



So he runs off, with B and M. All the while not telling me exactly where he went. When I finished my popsicle I was feeling soo good, refreshed and everything, soo I was ready for what I liked to call my missions. My mission was to find the rest of the guys, G by the way never showed up\ldots 

The first place I went, the spot where all my friends smoked at lunch, was where they were, between the three of them, they had finished around a vial of K. We decide to walk to our friend's house, this is around 2 hours after we smoked the stuff, and I am strangly not comming down like normal.



We finally get to her house, she is home alone, we mess around in her back yard for a bit. Finally we decide to go inside, we go into her basement and into a little room, with the lights out. And there the thoughts started again, only this time it wasn't good thoughts, all I could think of was all the times friends and family had stabbed me in the back, cheated me, or just plane been a dick twards me. Once again I didnt stop thinking about this until, R tackled me onto the bed. This was about 5 hours, and I could feel the effects starting to wear off, they never really wore off until the next day.



Some may say this was a bad trip, but I can honestly say that it was by far one of the most life changing experiences of my life. I finally knew and respected what was truely important in life, and the value of everything in general. One other wierd thing that has since happened numerous times is this strange feeling I get, almost like a feeling of understanding and euphoria, and yet a strangly depressing feeling at the same time.
