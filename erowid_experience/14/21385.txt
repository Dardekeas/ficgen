Part One



Looking for a legal alternative to Cannabis I had read several things on Sceletium Tortuosum (kanna).  I ordered a small amount to give it a try. I was very surprised at the buzz I got from this plant. I took about 4 or five small hits in a one hit pipe\ldots holding the smoke for as long as I could\ldots it had a strange but not unpleasent taste.  It took about 15 minutes to really feel the effects \ldots a nice mellow pot like buzz but without the time distortion that cannabis gives.  My face felt kind of hot but not like a `I feel sick hot'\ldots just a strange heat like sensation.  I would really like to smoke the whole amount that I have to see what happens but it's expensive and kind of hard to get\ldots .so I'm saving it.  



I am already looking for some place to get some live plants and have searched for a couple of days now with no luck\ldots .seeds can be had (but they are hard to find as well) but I think I would have better luck with rooted plants. A very pleasent plant indeed\ldots  but it's no replacement for pot\ldots like the song says  `there's nothin like the real thing.'



Part Two



After experimenting with Sceletium tortuosum for a few days in a search for a legal Marijuana alternative to ease my depression. I at first had high hopes I had found what I was looking for.



As I reported in my first submission to this vault `it was a pretty good buzz after 4 or 5 hits' but now after several days of using it in small amounts (it's hard to put into words)\ldots  but \ldots In my spirit I feel there is something in this plant that is harmful\ldots not sure what it is but I'm not comfortable with it.
