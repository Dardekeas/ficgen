I was sitting at home, drinking som Cognac and playing socialgames, on the net.

I decided to take just half the pill i had, coz of the drinking i've been doing. Swalloved half (50mg) the pill AET, playing psycedelic music wich a love! Been drinking about 6-7 shots(4cl Ã¢ peice) of 40\% Cognac. 



10minutes nothing.. 

15minutes something..

20minutes having thoughts about yesterdays DXM trip\ldots  



That DXm did really give me a brainjob, but today (about 20hours later) it's really no hangover from that. Dxm is not something i recommend, it's just too hard(nervotoxic) as it is.   



less then 25 min has gone by. Feeling a MDMA effect in my brain, euforia, wanna dance, 

not as nice as MDMA, but kinda like Methylone but a better high feeling . 



35min, cant keep the rest of happiness waiting, I drop the rest another 50mg\ldots . 



I'm sitting with my computer, listening, changing tunes, digging with my legs and body.. no sound hallusinogenic yet, just an ok feeling on/in top of my head.



60 minutes.. feeling fine soft, wanna chat with others, (chatting). No enhanching just enyoing it.. I'ts  a gentle feeling trouhg my system that passes, no max just middle all over\ldots  great party drug(with alc) if u ask me.. not to much and none the less..



Now 1hour n 45mins it's no bettre than when 45mins had gone by. Kinda soft .. but not much.. a filling feeling all over.



3 hours.. feeling fine.. a bit wasted, a slow comedown\ldots 

Feeling is like a fever, warmth.. feeling sleepy.. no pain , just tired n used.. 



Well it's  surely working and it's pretty nice, if compared to E and Methylone, not at all the comedown of E and methylone, but then again not as nice. Sure i'll give it:

For mental use a 6/10, for party use also a 6/10.
