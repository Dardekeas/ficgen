I recently switched my breakthrough pain meds from Percocet 5mg(5 a day) to Statex (Morphine Sulphate) 5 mg., 5 a day. I use the Ratio-Pharm generic Fentanyl patch (100mcg/h) as my main pain med. I find that the Ratio patches stick better. Anyways, everyone has heard of Morphine - it's the gold-standard opiate that to me I beleived was saved for the terminally ill. So I was cautious about starting the morphine, and although I have received it IV in the hospital, I didn't know what to expect taking it orally and regularly.



At first dosing, I took my 25mg as directed and I felt nothing! This started a 24-hour panic (and pain) attack. I awoke the next morning after a horrible night, took 5 5mg Morphine pills (as directed) along with 20mg of Valium (also as directed). This I felt. I started the familiar `nod', falling in and out of consciousness. Compared to Percocet, I found it much less cloudy - cleaner. Light was clear, everything in the room became more colourful, and although I was `on the nod', I could snap out of it in an instant! My breakthrough pain finally went away, and I was left comfortably on my couch listening to Baroque Counterpoint music - very mathematical but extremely expressive - and I was in no pain, emotionally stable, and generally in a very nice physical, emotional, and mental state.



What really got me were the `Morphine Dreams' I was experiencing! I've heard all about them in novels and on TV - Sherlock Holmes (I think he preferred cocaine\ldots ), the other detective character who could see Jack the Ripper in his Opiate dreams, and many more. It wasn't until I experienced it myself!!! WOW!!!! It was as though I could lie down comfortably, close my eyes, and re-create my own environment, or World! (i.e. living room). I could move around this `internal reality' like it was an ordinary day, read things, have phone conversations, surf the web! -- it was so real!! My Morphine Dreams are sooooooo lucid it can be difficult to distinguish from reality. 



My body was completely relaxed, similar to smoking some high quality Hashish, and again my mind was so clear and sharp, not dulled like I used to feel when I took Oxycodone(Percocet). 



For my breakthrough pain, I'm glad I made the switch, as Percocet would make me tired and groggy, and forgetful. Morphine has wonderful body relaxation properties, as well as visual and mental clarity. It takes a little longer to kick-in (these aren't continual release), but the pain control is adequate, and my ability to function as well as my quality of life has increased since the switch. And the side-effects like noding and dreaming have diminished as my body has gotten used to the drug. (good in the long-term, but not as fun anynore).



To summarize, in my experiences with pain management medications, Morphine has one of the `cleanest' euphorias. It isn't as effective for pain as Fentanyl, however I have not really felt any euphoria from Fentanyl before - it's probably the best for pain (fentanyl), but for Euphoria I would rate Demerol \#1, Morphine \#2, Oxycodone \#3, Dilaudid \#4, and Codeine \#4. These are all the Opiates I've tried. \#'s 1,2, and 4 I've received IV and IM, the rest (including Morphine and Dilaudud as well) I took by mouth. I also tried liquid Dilaudid, but felt nothing. I think you need to `wake-up' your receptors before the drugs work as they should - I think that's why I didn't feel much the first time I took the Morphine pills. I remember too in high-school, when I smoked my first joint, inhaling, I didn't get high, where my best friend was stoned as a rock! The second time I smoked, I was definitely stoned!



So, Morphine lives up to its' namesake `Morpheus', the Roman God of Dreams.
