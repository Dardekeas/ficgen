I would just like to start by saying that 700mg is what dose I can only guess I insufluated throughout the night, We had ordered 5g of MXE of the web and as it had arrived we decided to give it a shot having done it twice previously at a much lower dose (100mg each time) and we wanted to do some research on this new and exciting chemical\ldots 



So me and A B and C are in the bedroom of my friend D's flat, which was at this time rife with a celebration of 2 of my friends birthdays, so me and birthday boy (B) decide we should preemptively put all 5g of MXE into empty paracetamol capsules in order to make it easier to snort while we were in the field we were later camping at (basic convenience) before we started doing this everyone who was taking the MXE who was present (about 6 people) had a nice little line which precisely weighed out at 100mg per line. We me and B ended up just trying to make the MXE into 44 caps instead of weighing it out because it was way too fiddely\ldots we really shouldn't have because we were very weirded out by this point and made pretty uneven caps (they would have all been within a few mg of each other however because we did get 44 total caps)\ldots 



So me and the other 6 had another cap each because we decided to get as out of it as we could before we got to the party (this is at 5:30 in the evening), we set of to the party location to get there for 6, which we did and by this time we were all pretty floaty and everything was pretty strange.



As we entered the field it all went crazy from there\ldots  we all broke out another cap each bringing it down to about 3.6g total MXE left, we spent a while going crazy and dancing etc and in this time I insuffluate waaaay more than I should (a further 3 caps) in the space of what I can only guess was about an hour, simply put I was completely anesthetized by about 7pm, which resulted in me laying on my back on the ground with all of the drunkard crowd trying to look after me because they didnt understand I was fine and that I was just on the edge of existance in my mind, my fellow MXE heads were all wandering around in 2's having some crazy hallucionations and shouting alot\ldots 



around 9pm I regain conciousness after lying unresponsive on the ground for a while, a friend offered me a few from a J to calm my mind, it worked a treat and as I sat there my mind slowly reformed to the point where I was mentally centered\ldots  I have to point out the trips from this are stronger than any acid or mushroom trip I have ever had but the trips are alot more warped delusions of reality rather than coulorful mystical revelations\ldots I adore this chemical\ldots aaaanyway after this event we all decided to walk around town for some godawful reason I still do not fully understand, so I took the last cap which I was allowing myself to consume that night and wandered into town\ldots 



My mind jumps to all of us sat in a location I had never seen which is apparently located at our local dry ski slope, which is strange as I could swear for the entire time we were atop a huge hill when really we were at the bottom of said ski slope on padded cushiony things\ldots Yeah I don't get what they are either\ldots 



We walked back up to the field after a J at the slope and hastily took some lines of MD to bring ourselves\ldots  well I dont really know what we were thinking here because we were already all in a different realm\ldots  but we did, approximately 60mg each and after a few minutes we were all in a state of unimaginable happiness and glee, we didn't gurn however which was odd for MD as I usually do\ldots  basically the rest of the night literally consisted of me and  6 friends laughing hysterically at each other and not finishing sentences properly and sniffing another line of MD at which point we all went into parallel universes of our own\ldots I could see the world around me (the roof of a tent) fold into itself and warp in so many ways as we smoked the last joint\ldots 



I was wrecked the entire next day and had to be told about my ordeal of semi dying next to a tree, we all had our own insanity moments that night and telling them all now would take years to be able to explain it\ldots 



My conclusion starts with an apology as unless you have taken a large of amount of dissociatives you cannot have the feelings and hallucinations explained to you therefore the report, basically I sum it up as the strongest K hole imaginable, for about 7 hours real time and then an entire day of of what I would say I would feel from taking a small line of ketamine, POWERFUL stuff and one thing I found interesting about this particular chem is it doesn't have very much delving into the spiritual realm, its more a schizophrenic mess, I would advise people take it responsibly\ldots 



The next day we found that every single cap was gone from the bag they were contained in and each cap we found was completely empty\ldots  4.3 grams (because I had 700mg) was split between about 7 people?  it was an extremely savage night\ldots I would do it again in a heartbeat

Thank you for taking the time to read my report
