  It was to be my first roll--my boyfriend at the time was able to procure four beautiful little pills (anchors, off-white, split back, later analyzed by a chemist friend of mine, found to be 100\% pure MDA), and after making ourselves comfortable in his dorm room, we each took one and settled back to enjoy the results.



Within about 45 minutes, I began to hallucinate trails and `stop-motion' vision quite vividly.  Having never tried `ecstasy' before, I became somewhat overwhelmed and felt a brief queasiness that subsided with a few deep breaths.  The hallucinations continued (though less vividly) for several hours, during which I could not stop grinding my teeth. My eyes fluttered in their sockets like moths, and I was rolling so hard I thought (several times) that I would faint.  I spent a lot of the first hour peering into a mirror, admiring the INCREDIBLY LARGE size of my pupils. 



  About 2 hours into the roll, we each took another pill and walked around our small college campus.  My vision was super bright (as with LSD) and the hallucinations intensified with each `peak.'  At one point I held a cheerful conversation with my best friend, who was in actuality not there.  The rest of the evening was a blur of intense feelings of well-being and euphoria, coupled with visual distortions that ranged from mild to delirious.



  It would probably be dangerous for me to drive, deal with potentially trouble-causing people/authority figures, etc. while peaking.  Also, the physical residue of the drug lingers for a couple of days--the `jittering' eyes and trails may continue well after the roll.  



  That said, no roll with MDMA has ever even come close to what I experienced with MDA that night.  The two have a lot in common, but MDA is more of an hallucinogen, and at times can be so overwhelming that it could probably induce `the fear' in someone unfamiliar with the compound's effects.  MDA gets me HIGH--and more importantly, its manifestations upon my mind/emotions allow for a heightened sense of empathy and awareness of beauty.  It can be a very meaningful, humbling experience.
