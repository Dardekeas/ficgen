Before starting this trip rapport I should tell about my previous use of Methylone, because I believe that to be the reason I needed so much more of the compound than anyone else. I have been using methylone for about 2 years, sometimes quite heavily, but that is another case, you can read about that here: \href{http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=67196}{Erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=67196}



09:45 -- I woke up.

The mood was great this morning, I had a good feeling about this day, it was Friday and one of my friends was throwing a big party tonight, and best of all, I had the whole day free. I put myself in front of the computer and ate a little breakfast. Hadn't even been there for 10 minutes when the door bell rings. Post I thought happily! I had been waiting for Mephedrone for only a few days, and it wasn't much more than 2 weeks ago I learned the existence of it, but I still had this feeling that it would be great.



09:55 -- The packet.

I didn't dare to hope that it was this new compound, I get packets everyday, and it could be anything, but I hoped. When I opened the door there was a man in orange TNT cloth with a little package in he's hand, I almost jumped around in happiness (this was perfect, at the party tonight most of my friends would be, they could help me test it!)  I took the packed, signed, closed the door and opened the it, there was a little zip back with a light yellowish compound which smelled very funny. I knew I had smelled this ``old'' smell before, but I couldn't see where, at least not until I snorted it.



10:25 -- The first snort.

After finishing my breakfast and answering e-mails I came to that conclusion of thought that; I was home alone, my girlfriend wouldn't come home for hours,  I ``HAD'' to test this new compound before giving it to others this night. I took out my 0,001g scale and weighed out 10mg (better safe than sorry, eh?), lined it up, and snorted it. It stings a bit, nothing much and the smell was very intense. Here it came to me; the smell was the smell of an old circuit board, a very nice smell for a guy like me that loves old hardware, very safe. After about 5 minutes I felt a few traces of euphoria, nothing much and could easily be placebo.



I waited 30 minutes more and snorted 40mg.

 

11:30 -- First real traces of Euphoria.

That worked a little, I felt very sharp and clearheaded, a bit like a small dose of amphetamine. I felt very fast, ran around the house and cleaned.



12:10 -- The bigger dose.

I snorted another 100mg, just to be sure it wasn't placebo, and the compound really worked.



12:25 -- The effect.

That worked, the euphoria is even better than methylone, and I feel so speeded, like I can work for 100+ hours without getting tired. The music is so much better than normally, and I can both work, do homework and heir music at once, tho. I am not getting much work done, I use more time telling my friends on MSN how good it is.



12:50 -- 50mg more snorted

The effect keeps the same, but I still chooses to snort some more.



13:20 -- 50mg more snorted 

The effect gets even better and I get Goosebumps sometimes, I choose to snort another 50mg.



13:50 -- Big oral dose.

One of my friends comes over, and he drives me to a swimming hall where we both takes 200mg orally. We swim around a little, the water feels really great! We find out that the swimming hall didn't have a Jacuzzi and both feels a bit disappointed, we then both goes to the sauna, which feels fantastic!! My friend says that he can feel the 200mg a lot, and that it feels a bit like mdma and amphetamine together, just much more euphoric.



18:00 -- Another big oral dose.

After the sauna we drives home again, and hit home around 18:00 where we both takes 200mg more (oral). I have a little jaw tension, but it really isn't much.



We talk a lot and time passes, we snort a few lines but I have stopped weighing it now.



20:15 -- Picking up my friend.

Another friend calls and says that we should pick him up at the station, so we do.



At first he can't even see that we are stoned, but he picks it up as we go drive.



We now drives to the party.



As we drive I want some more, and I get that crazy idea (as I often do..) to snort from the zip bag. I fold a note and snort, I snorted a lot.. I don't know how much I snorted, but I snorted a lot. After a few minutes it feels like my body is having an orgasm, my whole body, I get Goosebumps all over my body and it feels so great. 



21:00 -- The party.

We now arrive at the party where people is very happy to see us, and us them. Everyone is so exited to try this new compound, and I haven't even taken off my jacket before I start lining up lines for everyone. 3 of them want it orally, so I weigh out 3*200mg for them and they drink it in a cup of water, and all 3 said it tasted better than they thought it would. Within long; people start talking about how good it is, everyone is getting much more effect out of it than me, and I believe this to be because of my tolerance to methylone.



22:00 -- Coke

Around this time I stop taking Mephedrone and starts on a little zip bag of coke, it feels so great. They fit really great together.



02:00 -- Going home

The effects of mephedrone are still very traceable, and I still feel great. But my friend wants to go home around this time and I want him to drive me, so I say goodbye and leave with my friend. Everyone else is still partying and I can see that they love it.



03:00 -- Home

Around this time I get home, I have some trouble sleeping at first but after some time I sleep without aid.



15:00 -- The day after.

I sleep right until 15:00 next day, and I feel great when I wake up. A little dizzy, but almost nothing.
