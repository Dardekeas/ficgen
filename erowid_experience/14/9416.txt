Usually I only did 3 whippets, with standard results:  Lots of auditory distortion, kind of a metallic whooshing crackling sound, visual blurs, tingling in nose, etc.  We decided to try 4 whippets this time (we crack them into a garbage bag and inhale from there).  Also, I tried something new.  Instead of just huffing the contents, I cupped the bag around my nose and mouth and just started talking to the group as if nothing was different.  The ascent was much slower and I could watch what was going on.  I started to get the tingling and the ringing, but I noticed that I was also losing more and more of my self.  



It gradually progressed until my thoughts stopped altogether on the word I was last thinking, and that word expanded in what it means to me (i.e. the word green means a color, of a certain wavelenght of light), to mean everything.  Then there wasn't even that word.  I wasn't me, I wasn't anyone.  The Universe made sense because I was IT.  But I (or IT) wasn't really conscious, it just WAS.  Slowly, I started to return.  It felt like my consciousness was contracting from encompassing the entire universe, gradually into just me.  As I started to become human and linguistic again, the word that I left on came back, and it slowly lost its status as meaning everything and it was left with just it's original meaning, and I gradually started thinking again.  It ruled, but I never had quite that good an experience again, even with 5 whippets.
