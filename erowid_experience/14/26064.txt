I offer this brief encounter for educational purposes:

It was within the split-second it took for the 5mg of powder to leave the table and enter my nose that I realized my error.  This substance was not to be snorted.  The burn was immediate and terribly uncomfortable.  It wasn't the taste or texture, the problem lay in the pain emanating from the surface of my nasal cavity.  I called RP off in time, I knew immediately that it certainly wasn't worth it, that I would not be attempting this method again.  Psychoactivity and symptoms were very similar to this substance smoked, but less intense and more brief.  Visual distortions began only a few minutes later, followed by mild nausea and fatigue.  A series of unproductive states of mind and body for 20-30 minutes, with a rapid decline shortly after.  



The general feeling was consistent with oral doses of the same substance, somehow encapsulating the more negative side effects of this phenethylamine.  No positive effect during this experience outweighed the negative, and I have little reason to believe a different dose would have resulted in a more fruitful half of an hour.  I do believe, however, that a greater dose may have resulted in some degree of bodily peril, based solely on the toxic nature of the evening recounted, and therefore do not recommend this method.
