Several years ago, I experimented with DMT. I was introduced to this chemical through a friend of mine who was heavily into Shamanism. Over a 12 month period, I smoked it 4 times, with ever increasing doses. My friend recommended that I `work my way up to the 'spirit' dose'. This was wise, because even in smaller doses, it can be a frightening experience. On my fifth `journey', I found them - or more accurately, they found me.



I've since read accounts from McKenna, and Strassman's subjects. I guess my experience was similar, though I didn't perceive myself as being inside a structure - rather, it seemed that the spirits were all around me. Wherever I looked, the swirling patterns transmogrified into these oscillating things which clearly acted independently of my own thoughts. At least that was the overwhelming perception I had. I can't really describe them - they were infinite in their complexity. I can see why people are convinced that they are entities separate from their own minds - its inconceivable that anyone can imagine such \ldots  I don't what you'd call them or it.



Anyway, I was there - wherever the hell it was - and all of a sudden each one of my fingers was connected to a spirit. Here's where it gets really strange - there were thousands of them near me now (and millions in the distance - though if I looked at the distant ones, they zoomed up close). So, next thing I know, each hand has thousands of fingers. I had complete control over each one! Like we can move our left index finger, I could control left finger 40,624. It was like I was a conductor - they were dancing and flying around in accordance with what I did with my `super-hands'. Sound and sight seemed to merge and shift - I was conducting an orchestra of millions. 



There was a lot of other stuff too, but I have never been able to recall it. My final memory is being in absolute nothingness, except for one spirit. As I looked at it, it started to oscillate so as I was looking at myself - or what I perceived was myself - I was changing form a thousand times a second. The oscillations became faster - and the spirit wanted to know who it was. It wasn't asked in words, but I knew what the question was - somehow. I said `I don't know'. This `conversation' went back and forth at an ever greater speed until, at the same time, we were both saying `he is you is he is you\ldots .'. Then the words converged into `hue' - literally it was blue. I mean, I became the colour blue. A psychedelic play on words! I was a frequency! Then this spirit rushed up to me from the other side of the galaxy, laughing. He had a present - like a normal box with a blue ribbon, and he said what's your favourite `hue'? Next thing I knew I'd opened my eyes. The extra freaky element was that I had turned my head around and was looking straight out the window\ldots at, you, guessed it, a big clear blue sky! 



Once I had met them (or myself, perhaps - I certainly don't ascribe to the literal idea that DMT is conducive to contacting aliens), I decided not to do DMT again. I have experienced total and absolute fuck'n out there - and I'd be scared that if I did it again, that I wouldn't make it back. I don't think that there could be a more intense experience, however, I never imagined I'd experience what I did either. Its amazing - but a word of caution: it isn't a fun party drug. Some people want to go skydiving, and that's cool. But this was like being a super-ball bouncing around the universe. At the time, it really was too much!!!



The final freakiness? At certain times of the morning or afternoon, I look at the sky, and get this deja-vu feeling. Its just the right shade of blue!
