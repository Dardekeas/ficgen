I recently had a muscle strain in my lower back from working.  I got  a script for the muscle relaxer Skelaxin.  I thought, you know--a pill is a pill, so at first I snorted one tab.  I didn't expirence any kind of a high or buzz, but I was slightly relaxed.  I was disappinted with the result, for it burned the inside of my nose pretty bad.



So I decided I would just eat a couple and see what happened. I waited 5 hours after my last meal, it was about 11:00 PM On a Friday night.  I took 5 tabs, of 400mg Skelaxin at that time and waited.  I felt very calm, but not as good as a buzz off a Z, or Soma or anything.  I sat and watched T.V. for a bit, and got very very upset.   I didn't really have any kind of a buzz, and it was about 12:00AM [midnight].  As I wached TV, I felt my noze itch, so I reaced across to scratch it.  As my hand reached my nose, my arm slid across my face and into the air without my control.  I also felt wetness on my hand, and when I looked for the source, I saw that I had been drooling and was unaware.  For about the next half hour, I felt extremly relaxed and happy.  I laid back on my couch and let my mind wander.  



None of my senses were impared, except for my sense of touch.  My fingers, nose, and my ass all `fell asleep' and became numb at different times for about 5 minutes each. I also noticed that my gums were numb.  Also, my hearing was slightly muffled.



I didn't crash off the Skelaxin, but I did get very sleepy and VERY dizzy when I walked around at about 12:15am.  The buzz was okay, but that was my first expirence with Skelaxin.  I would say that 2 tabs of Zs would be a better buzz than 5 tabs of Skelaxin.
