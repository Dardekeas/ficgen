1945-- I just took 300mg lyrica, 200mg elavil, 10mg percocet, and 1 fioricet. I also have one of those power energy shots that im thinking of taking when i get really tired. Looking back at all of that typed out makes me think that it may not have been my best idea ever, but i guess im just going to have to see where this takes me\ldots  



1950-- Already bored of waiting for the effects to kick in, i guess that i will just go smoke a bowl (marijuana) while i wait.



2000-- Starting to feel a little warm in the face and lightheaded\ldots  a little bit of tingling. Its pretty faint and not easy to describe, but it is noticeable. I have been reading some of the other experiences and I just want to mention this incase something crazy happens and i die or something, I love you mom and am so proud of my two brothers that i cant even describe it. 



2011-- I find myself feeling really tingly and also really warm and fuzzy. Im spacing out alot and forgetting to keep typing, im normally a really quick typist but im finding it really really hard to focus on it at all, its now 2018 and i am still typing\ldots 



2033-- My thinking and even my movement seams really slow and sluggish, like things are delayed or something, it also feels really hard to move, like i weigh about another 100 pounds. Even my eyes seam very slow when i move them from one place to another or when i try to read. 2040 is the time right now, so it took about 7 minutes in order to type this\ldots 



Well, after that last entry i just kind of passed out, i remember seeing something out of the corner of my eyes and trying to grab for it but never actually catching it. Once i passed out i was GONE, people tried to wake me and i was completely unresponsive, they almost called 911 but decided against when they could see i was still breathing. So\ldots  yea.. i am going to do it again pretty soon probably\ldots
