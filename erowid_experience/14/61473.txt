My friend offered me this pill I never heard of before. He said it was a painkiller, which I love so I happily accepted it. It was a very small pill, about the size of an oxycottin. It also had a lime green coating on it. 



At about 2 in the afternoon, I crushed it up and snorted it. I immediatley felt a head rush, not much of a head rush but it was significant enough to know I was gonna have a good time. Approximately 20 minutes later my body felt very good like I was floating, very much like a heroin high. I felt very blissful and euphoric. I was very itchy the whole time it lasted. About an hour after I ingested the pill, my eyes began to feel heavy. I wasnt quite nodding off, just sleepy I guess. The body feeling kept progressing as time went on. Out of nowhere my stomach felt upset for a few minutes and I puked, very very little though, but once it came up I felt great. Puking didnt decrease my high one bit, it actually made it better. About an hour after that I was in the car going for a ride and I started to nod off a lot. I couldnt keep my head up and when I did I would have double vision untill I shook it off, but it would start again once I could see straight so I just kept my eyes closed, mind you I was still feeling euphoria. I then passed out at about 10pm sitting at my computer. Lol. It was very fun and I will definitely be doing it again.
