I had been using GHB and GBL for quite some time usually taking one dose a day. A few months back I started taking it more often but started having problems. Firstly I have to say that at the time I was having sleeping trouble and often only sleeping a few hours at a time which magnified this problem. The problem was that after using 8-9g GHB or about 6ml GBL I would get anxious and irritable, quite uncomfortably so. One day I only got an hour sleep and after the 2 X 3ml of GBL had worn off the anxiety was HORRIFIC almost to the point of going to hospital and persisted for about 24 hours. (it took 24-30 hours before my anxiety was baseline)



The higher the dopamine the less deep sleep I get. This in turn causes more anxiety because I'm not sleeping well AND I am tiring my brain out due to constantly high dopamine all day! The thing is I dont realise I'm loosing sleep quality because the tiredness isnt noticable due to high dopamine!



I noticed that the less time I leave between GHB doses the lower the euphoria. I have found that if I use GHB only once a day (I can top up that session so I might total 4-5g) is best PREFERABLY as far from bedtime as possible. I found when I took 2 doses a day even with 7-8 hours apart the high just wasnt anywhere nears as good.



OK so to round up quickly here is my strategy.



I dont use more than 3ml GBL (4-5g GHB) per day.

I take it as early in the day as possible.

I dont take GBL two evenings in a row as I will suffer bad sleep.

I take a day off whenever possible.
