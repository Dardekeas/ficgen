Previous mystical experiences: A feeling of pure bliss/love while meditating on mushrooms -- knowing that I and everything else was God.



Previous drug experiences: I sniffed coke about twenty times during a span of about a year/ Consumed E at least once every weekend for about four months/Tried acid once/Smoked crystal for about two weeks . 

	

Previous plant experiences: I've smoked a lot of Cannabis/ I've smoked salvia divinorum a few times in the last month (only light doses).  



I have been mediating daily for about a few months now, and I've experienced some pretty incredible coincidences. When I tap into this infinite organizing field of intelligence, my deepest wishes seem to manifest. But something happened today that I was not expecting. I was kind of stressed out, so I decided that I would mediate for a while. I hopped on my bed and closed my eyes. While lying down, I used the mantra so- hum (thinking the word ``so'' while inhaling, and ``hum'' while exhaling, while concentrating on the sound of my breath)(1). I also would periodically stop the breath work (every minute or two), and just lay there in silence -- allowing no thoughts to enter my consciousness. When this became too difficult to sustain, I would return to the breath work. 



I'm guessing that I was meditating for about fifty minutes, and then it happened. My body felt very light, and I could sense that I was disconnecting from it. I then consciously made it my intention to leave my body (although I didn't actually think it was going to happen). I felt myself going up towards the roof in a quick-like fashion -- and even though I didn't look down -- it was evident that I was out of my body ( I could see that I was in my room , even though my eyes were closed). I wasn't really happy or scared at first -- I just `was'. I then started to think that maybe I would die if I stayed `out' for an extended period of time, so I tried to return to my body. I opened my eyes (which was difficult), and I laid there in amazement. An out of body experience -- and I wasn't even high! This was the most amazing thing that I have ever experienced. Next time, I'll see if I can prolong the experience for a little longer.     



(1) -- this is the mantra Deepak Chopra recommends
