I bought JWH-250 instead of JWH-018 because 018 is now illegal in Alabama. JWH-250 is just like 018 in intensity, but it lasts an even shorter time. Marijuana lasts about 2-3 hours (if I haven't smoked in a while) and JWH-018 lasts an hour to 1.5 hours, but the intensity of 250 lasts only 30 minutes. It is still worth buying, though. I can get freaky high on this stuff, the problem is not that it's milder, but that it doesn't last as long. This might be convenient for some people, though, who have a short lunch hour! 



The powder I got was about \$40 a gram s/h included and was white to light pink, and melted on tinfoil at the touch of a lighter to a pink liquid which vaporized. I did not try snorting it, since JWH-018 was not active when snorted. I do not know if it is cross-tolerant with 018 but the intensity of smoking it after 2 weeks without 018 did not leave me wanting more. I'd compare this chemical to smoking the kindest of the kind bud, but the buzz leaves me very quickly. Worth it, though, again. 



[Reported Dose :  15-25 mg]
