I found myself without yoga



A few years ago, my girlfriend and I, both of us who had a profound spiritual experience on MDMA and LSD at a rave, invited a friend to take E with us. She was very cautious, very antidrug even though she was quite a drinker and nicotine addict.



We began with yoga, while waiting for the E to kick in. After a while, I remarked, `why are we doing yoga? yoga's purpose is to get us here, and we are already there!' The others agreed and we finished up a few more postures.



The peak of the night occurred after my girlfriend and I were talking together and then turned back to our friend. She was in tears.



Looking up at us, she said, `I found myself.' We both hugged her, telling her how glad we were. She then told us that she finally understood why we talked about MDMA like we did.
