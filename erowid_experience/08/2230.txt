20 mgs of 5-MeO-DMT were separated into different amounts, one of them was about 8 mg. I had not eaten for quite a while and did not have a completely empty stomach when I did it, so I drank one glass of milk. I half an hour, crushed up the crystals and separated the powder into two small lines. I snorted one through each nostril. My nose began to burn a bit, but nothing really painfull. It began to kick in, in about 5 minutes. Things began to look fuzzy and I got a little jittery. Colors were enhanced a little bit and I had that tryptamine smile on my face. My upper teeth also began to hurt a little bit, nothing big tho. About 20 to 25 five minutes after consumption, I began to get a little nausea. It wasn't the kind of nausea you get when you eat something that shouldn't be in your stomach, but more of the kind you get when your stomach is too weak to handle it. It keept getting stronger until I purged. I didn't feel bad when I was throwing up, it was kinda funny actually. I felt much better and happier now and my nose also stoped burning. This is when my mind drifted off. I was getting information, and actually having a conversation with another spirit. Of course I can't talk about what I learned, but I can say it was very enlightening. The entire conversation lasted about 5 minutes, and then I started to come down. The effects lasted for a total of about 45 minutes. There was no after effects. I feel that if I had eaten more that day before the ingestion of the 5-MeO-DMT I would have not puked. I also think that if I had not puked, the experience would not have been as good. I give this way of ingestion a thumbs up.
