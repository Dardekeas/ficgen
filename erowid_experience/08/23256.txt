Last week I decided to try some Dipt I had acquired.  Being my first time with the substance, I didn't know how to eyeball a dosage.  I proceeded to split my DiPT into two capsules.  Both looked like small level AMT dosages (40-60mg).



At around 5pm I ate one of the capsules.  At 6:30 I still wasn't feeling any real effects (no sound distortions), so I ate the second pill.  At 7:30 the trip started to set in pretty strong.  Voices started to sound deeper and metallic.  Every voice sounded the same.  I felt extremely high and had a very hard time comprehending anything.  Lights began to come from all around.  An iridescent `smoke' (kinda hard to describe) began to surround me.



By 8pm I had lost almost all touch with reality.  My body was completely numb.  I had hit the peak, which lasted till about 10pm.  It felt like a 2 hour DMT rush.  Thoughts flew through my head.  Sounds were plentiful but I couldnt distinguish sounds from within my house from those outside, or those within my head.  I couldnt move, aside from twitching around in my bed.  I was pretty scared.



My girlfriend came over at midnight.  I was still tripping hard (alot of visuals, sounds were still distorted as they were when my trip began).  I could cope at this point.  At about 3am most of the trip had subsided.  To this day I still get very spacy whenever I smoke some pot.  It seems like this substance could have great potential in the proper dosage.
