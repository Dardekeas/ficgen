After learning about Kava through a report I had to give in an Anthropology class, I decided to give it a try.



I ordered ground Kava root powder imported from Vanuatu. After receiving it in the mail, I made up a batch for myself and my friend using a blender/strainer method as recommended on the bag (with 1 rounded tablespoon kava per cup of cool water). The resulting liquid made my mouth slightly numb within a few sips. I became unable to fully enjoy the taste of other foods, especially sweet ones.



Physically, the Kava didn't really have any dramatic effects on my vision or sense of balance. At this dose, I was able to easily walk straight and keep my balance.  My friend seemed to stumble for a bit, but he had chugged all of his beverage in two big gulps rather than drinking it slowly as I had. Mentally, I didn't feel the kind of perceptual blur that comes with imbibing any significant quantity of alcohol. Rather, I felt clear minded and rather normal. Emotionally, I didn't feel ecstatic or overly happy, but rather calm and collected. The fact that my girlfriend had asked for a split earlier that day no longer irked me. I felt like it was something I could handle.  The only extraordinary emotional response I found was when my friend and I broke out laughing for a good five minutes due to the fact that I was holding one of the cookies we were eating upside-down.



After the fact, I found some minor gastrointestinal discomfort, but this had relieved itself by morning.



On the second night, I had a similar dosage except this time I prepared it by the traditional straining method. This batch seemed somewhat weaker than that prepared in the blender, but had a lighter taste. Its effects were much the same, although on this night I found myself a bit dizzy later in the night. However, this method of preparation seemed to spare me the discomfort afterward.



All in all, I found Kava's effects enjoyable without being inhibiting. As long as it is taken responsibly, I feel it has great antistress and enjoyment potential.
