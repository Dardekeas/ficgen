   I inhaled. 

              I exhaled. 



A few seconds later, I was overwhelmed by the drug. The feeling was of urgent distress. I felt stuck, both physically and mentally. I could hardly move, but I crawled towards the balcony to look outside. I looked over at the building across from the one I was in. The wall was bending and swirling. I kept getting higher and higher.



                Rocket 

                      brain.



Regret set in, I wished the feeling would go away. As soon as I made the wish I realized it would not come true. I was on a drug, it was taking effect, and I had to bear that effect until it expired. I wanted to make the feeling go away. Throwing up and banging my head against the walls crossed my mind. I didn't do any of these things, I just kept sitting in front of the balcony door, watching the wall swirl and twirl.



                Say goodbye 

                           to what you 

                                       `know'.



Eventually I stopped getting higher, at which point I gave in to it. I accepted the feeling as part of me for the rest of the trip, and thoroughly enjoyed the comedown.



The secret\ldots  let it flow through. I was trying to figure out the feeling\ldots  I was trying to gain control over it. Once I realized I had no control\ldots  once I gave up and let it push my mind around, I saw some incredible things.



                    THE DOOR 

                          IS 

                            OPEN NOW.



Everything around was alive, breathing, vibrating, communicating, with me. I was at a friend's house, and his mother has a thing for frogs. There was a stuffed toy frog between me and the balcony door. I looked down at it and it told me a lot about what life at that particular apartment is like. It didn't open it's mouth and speak, no. Just by looking at that frog I got a feel of the permanent mood of the apartment, and the people in it. 



                    Life\ldots 

                            is enigma.



That night I learned quite a few important lessons. In this life, the only thing you actually control is your own reactions to what is happening. Everything else is beyond your control. If you look carefully, a tiny rock on the side of the road could teach you a lot about the journey you are on. Nothing is insignificant.  



Open your eyes, open your mind. Look around, at the big big wide picture. At our world, in which everything is the way it is. Why are YOU HERE? 



                     HAVE FUN

                              trying  

                                    to solve it!
