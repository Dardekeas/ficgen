I have been smoking marijuana for a couple years now, cigars for about a year, but never cigarettes. About a month ago at a party, while quite drunk and high, I decided a cigarette would be a good idea, for fun. It was fun. It was a good immediate feeling, almost jittery and more focused than normal. Anyways, I liked cigarettes so  I have smoked about a pack a week (not an addiction by any means)for the past month. Tonight my friend and I could not get any herb so we got a pack of cigs and a cigar. This was the first time I had chain smoked, and after the fifth cig i started feeling sick. My friend had told me about nicotine poisoning/sickness before since he has smoked for a couple years, but i always thought i was big enough to handle it. after feeling sick for a minute, i immediately threw up, and continued feeling sick for about another ten minutes. my friend said that he had thrown up before and it was normal. I learned chain smoking the first time can not be good, so be careful the first time.
