The first time I tried inhaling N2O was on an afternoon when I was considerably bored.  I didn't know what to do, when I remembered hearing something about there being nitrous oxide in whipped cream containers\ldots so I thought I'd give it a shot.



All of the whipped cream was gone, so I just stuck it in my mouth, pushed the button, and inhaled.  At first, I just inhaled a little, for about 2 seconds.  The next time I got a lungful, and kept doing that until it was all gone.



At first, I thought that nothing was going to happen, but literally seconds later, I felt my lips get a little numb, and  I started giggling.  I didn't seem to think anything was funny.  I just started giggling to myself.  When I laughed to myself, it sounded different\ldots sort of far off.  It sounded like I was in a day-dream, and someone was laughing in the background.  I also simply couldn't stop laughing.  I just couldn't control myself.  I tried taking a few steps, then found myself wobbling around, and almost fell over.  Through my eyes, everything looked a little bit different, sort of fuzzy, and some things were moving a little bit\ldots shaking.  I also felt light headed, and very care-free; like nothing mattered.  I then felt a sense of euphoria, and the urge to talk to myself.  I talked to myself, and smiled, and giggled for about the next minute or so.  And then, all of a sudden, it all stopped.



I would have done it again, should there have been more nitrous in the whipped cream container.  This was my first time ever being under the effects of any drug\ldots I hadn't even had my first drink before.  So I simply thought it was amazing.  Anyways, I've now found out that it can be dangerous, and I'm very careful now.  I always inhale out of a balloon, and never do it while standing up.
