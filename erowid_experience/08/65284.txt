7:30pm: 5 hits acid, 3 liquid, 2 paper, multivitamins. I pace around my room sniffing at a tube of Vicks inhaler. It feels really good, and clears up my entire head.



7:45pm: took 2 more paper hits, and consider going to an oxygen bar.



9:45pm: I return from the local mall where the oxygen bar was closed. Skateboarding, however, was great. As I bombed a few hills, my peripheral vision would disappear and change into what I compared -- at the time -- to yellow and red cracks within an icecube. I stop a store on the way back for incense, peppermint oil, and vitamin c. I got lost trying to find my way back, and end up skating up and down empty streets until I find the main road again. I stop at a sidetrail to take some of my vitamin C, which a friend claimed increases visuals. Upon my return I encounter my friend L. We skate to the top of campus. L acts as a guide for the next several hours of the trip. We skate down the hill. The wind feels good, so I kneel down and hold my arms out to either side.



Returning to the dorms, we go to buy pot. I meet two women that L knows. I'm wearing laser light show glasses that create a rainbow of color in every direction around any source of light. 



S: ``Are you on drugs?'' 

Me: ``Do I look like the kind of person that would take drugs?'' 

S: ``Yes. Do I?''

Me: ``\ldots..no?'' 

S: Well, you're wrong. I am.''



We laugh. There was an initial tension in the air until I introduced myself, and it immediately clears up. We leave them and I buy an eighth. We smoke a bowl. The people in the room make snide asides about me tripping, and L defends me. I'm mostly quiet.



10:30pm: Marijuana, 2 shots Watermelon Vodka. L leaves, and says to call if I start freaking out or want to match on another bowl. I put a blacklight up in the corner of the room, and turn a strobe light on the other side. This creates an interesting lighting situation in the room, with everything white particularly bright, and the strobe light having the effect of slowing down time and motion. I listen to Pink Floyd's Meddle. This is common for me when I'm not under the influence of drugs, but I believe its still worthy of mention.



Closing my eyes, I imagine the music as a tight ball of energy with an inner glowing core which pulses to the beat. As this happens, flowing streams of light surround the surface and move to the flow of the individual intruments. When the song is completed, the patterns solidify and attatch to the surface, and the next song continues in this way until the album finishes. Often, what I can only describe as a `flattening effect' occurs, and the image appears in my mind almost as though a map of a planet. However - this is unlike what I describe later in the trip, which was a random open-eye visual taking place amongst many others.



12:30am: More marijuana, 1 hit on cube, 2 paper.



1:00am:  My roommate returns from studying we have a conversation about chemistry, batteries, and the mind. We talk about how the universe is made of mostly space. I take 10mg 2ci and make easy mac, which I put beef top ramen mix into at my roommate's suggestion.



2:00am:  I go outside and meditate while smoking cigarettes and hitting my new pipe. I go to a bench surrounded by trees, and drink Snapple as I smoke some of the best blueberry I've seen. The flavor of the Snapple is Mango Madness, and this amuses me. I'm nauseous. I move further down campus, and sit underneath a willow tree to smoke again. The branches hanging about me bounce and sway, and lights in the distance begin to explode if I look at them with my glasses off, an effect which I compare to pictures I've seen of nebulae and supernovas. I hear coughing from a nearby dorm, and I get up to walk to a hedge across from an engineering building. I meditate on a spot in front of me, watching the freshly green leaves of the tree meld together and begin forming yellow and red rhombic patterns to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Shpongle's Tales of the Inexpressible.



Closing my eyes provides me with spinning patterns of all colors. They mostly look like pipelines and spirals, or different arrays of colored dots. I imagine a teapot, and create a method to visualize its movement through space, and the changes it undergoes while traveling through time. It rapidly turns into an orange, a naked woman, musical notes, and random abstract shapes. I open my eyes. Some cars drive past. A few people walk by, and a car sits at the end of the road for what seems like hours. The bikes at the bikerack look odd, and very old. Their metal frames begin twisting into strange shapes. One of them is red, and this stands out in the darkness. I get up to return, and take notice that the grass in front of me has disappeared and it appears I'm walking on a field of marijuana leaves. I pick one up, and it turns into a rose, which I perceive to be breathing. I see 7 shadows surrounding my own, 4 to my left, and 3 to my right, but write this off as mere paranoia.



$\sim$:4:00am: I return to the dorm, and am immediately struck by the fact that my entire field of vision has gone hazy, and everything is divided into rhombic shapes. I blink several times, and my vision returns to normal. I spend nearly half an hour looking for my eyedrops, which I don't find. My mp3 player backlight provides a curious illumination to the typical yellow of the room, though. I give up, and sit on the couch to listen to Ween's The Mollusk, Shpongle's Nothing Lasts, and Lotus' The Strength of Weak Ties, RJD2's Deadringer, Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, and randomly selected Phish tracks. If I don't wear my glasses, lights and objects take on a peculiar brightness and begin melding together. I accidentally kick my blacklight down from its position, breaking it and having to replace it with an inferior.



Giving up my search, I move back to the couch, and put an icepack under my back -- for sensory effect. When I concentrate on my blacklight it begins to look like a planet, with weather patterns swirling around it, covering the buildings which have sprouted from its surface. If I focus on the room being lit up by this black-painted light, it flashes from purple to green and blue, and the blobs of color that are objects around the room begin to look like black clouds floating across my vision. The light begins to look like a living cell under a microscope. I look at the frame of my bed, and its underside swirls and changes to from light blue to dark.



This trip, to say the very least, was amazing. Many ideas running through my head for the past year have taken hold, and my beliefs and attitude concerning the world have been realigned to what I believe to be a more truthful perspective. I understand a lot of things about the people I know and the places I've been after careful reflection, which, I've found, can be particularly difficult for me while on lsd as I tend to exist primarily `in the moment,' with my attention honing in on several things at a time. This was my 21st trip, and, like all of the others, I considered the duration and occasional bouts of paranoia to be entirely worth it.



A side note on Vitamin C -- it appears to provide merely a placebo effect. I don't necessarily believe that it causes someone to ``peak,'' as my acquaintance so aptly put it.
