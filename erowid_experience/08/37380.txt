First of all I would like to state that I am an amazing light weight when it comes to pot, 2 joints of good pot and ill be at the puking stage.



I brought 1/8oz of pot off my dealer and I was told it was `very trippy stuff'. I smoked 1 joint and a couple of bowls of this stuff with my mate R and got very high, my girlfriend then called up to tell me that a bloke called J had a free house and if we brought pot we could stay round his. On the way to his house I kept hearing arguments and fights on the streets I was walking past, I also heard my family calling me and got very paranoid. I kept repeating `You're just tripping, it's not real, if it was someone  they would have come over to you, voices can't hurt.' 



After this first experience I realized the awesome power of this particular strain, it seemed to be something like white rhino. The next night I went to bed early and smoked about 1/4 of a bowl full. I put on the chillies on my headphones and examined the artwork on the green day `insomniac' album. I then began to stare at a psychedelics poster I have on my door, this is where it started to get really strange.



The poster grew to fill my entire vision and became black and white. The pattern then began to circle itself and make smaller more detailed patterns, I laid back and shut my eyes. The pattern faded to blackness but this blackness seemed to morph in some kind of way to the music, it was as if I was aware of it morphing but could not see it. After thinking about this for a long time (15 seconds?) I realised that I must be moving around a shape so I perceived it to be morphing. As soon as I realised this I began moving in empty 3D space to the music. This has happened to me when tripping before. I then tried to move myself in this 3D space. This was the turning point in the trip.



I managed to move myself but I also moved to the music so that every point of myself that I was aware of became a line (Kinda hard to explain but I basicly stretched every part of me) I then panicked slightly but realised I could undo it. For the next 10 seconds or so I played with this new trick (Stretching arms - legs - penis etc) The bizare thing is that I could actually feel these things changing. I then realised that if I can do this with my perceived physical body then I can do it with my mental self. The first thing that occurred to me is how much of a huge cock I could have if I played with this kind of auto hypnosis (is it?). I then told my head to make some kind of backup of my old self which I could go back to. I have no idea if this worked or not. I then tried to mess with my personality and make myself nicer. I actually felt the change and a kind of warm feeling in my chest, I also suddenly thought of all the loop holes in this change and how I could get walked all over etc. I then spent a while thinking and then realised the best thing to do was to repeat `I wish everything and everyone was great and I was great to my self and to everyone else' I must have repeated this loads of times and I definatly felt my self change.



I then have a blank spot and I can't remember what personality attributes I assumed. But I seem to remember that what I was repeating changed to `I wish me and L (my girlfriend) will be happy for ever.' Since I can't influence what L thinks I believe that I must have thought I had formed some kind of psychics link or had a transcendental moment in which those kind of things were within my grasp(!).



The music then changed to the next track which didn't feel so great so I opened my eyes and had one of those moments I often have on mushrooms or sometimes acid where the ceiling seems layered and doesn't make any sense, I then turned off my music and drifted off to sleep. The whole experience seemed to last anywhere between 5 and 15 mins, although I have a huge blank spot.



Since this trip I think I have noticed some subtle changes in my personality (mostly positive). I have also noticed that now if I trip alone I get very conscious of and paranoid about my own body and have thoughts like `Have I cracked my teath?' or `Have I pissed my self?' etc.
