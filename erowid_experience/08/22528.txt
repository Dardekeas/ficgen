It was around 2:15 AM when we initially dosed up, we eyeballed it and im guessing it was around 60 Mg's each.  I will Refer to us as A (me) S and D.  Me and S and taken 5 meo dipt before and D had never taken it, although he was familiar with DXM and mushrooms.

  

Around 3 we decided to go on a walk, D started talking very neurotically and was being very loud, we tried to calm him down, but he started trying to run away from us, when we caught him he started attacking us and screaming.  We decided this is not the best for us trying to keep a low profile that night, we are all honors students and were worried about our reputation.  After we realized D was totally losing it, and we were fearing for ours and his safety, we made the decision that we should try to knock him out.

  

At this point D had split into several personalities, one of them trying to run off like a scared animal, often times running on all fours.  The other viciously tearing at our throats, the other talking in a cool controlled voice saying to knock him out.  S then tried punching him in the back of the head a few times, no reaction, he then tried hitting him over the head with a rock, all this did was turn make the situation bloody.  After hitting D with the rock, he fell over and then got up, he looked at me, covered in blood, with the look of a someone possessed, i could see D's soul through his eyes, trapped in his own mind.

  

I then wrestled him into a stairway of the apartments we were in, S was banging on doors trying to get people to come out and help,and to call the police and paramedics, but they all seemed to scared to help.  Finally the paramedics showed up, but after seeing how violent D was being to me, they were scared to assist, and waited for the police.  When the police finally showed up they tackled both of us, and then D began trying to fight them off, it took about 3 minutes of 6 officers trying to contain him to get him restained, D was trying his hardest to hurt them and escape.  The police were beating him with knife sticks, and macing him almost non-stop.  They gave him a fire test to see if he responded to pain, which he didnt.

  

There I was drenched in blood in the stairway of some crappy apartments, watching my best friend (a normally good student and kid) trying to take on an entire police force covered in blood, switching between different personalities, and screaming as loud as possible, sometimes screaming my name.  The police then started asking questions about why he was bleeding, and put S in handcuffs, saying that if D died he would be charged with murder.  I tried telling them what he took, and they couldnt understand, there was 1 firemen actually listening to me, and allowing me to explain what tryptamines are, and what they should do and resources they could check, but all the police were just screaming at me and telling me to quit being a smart ass.  They were very confused about the 5 in the 5 meo dipt and kept saying that `he took 5 of something.'



I then went and got S's roommate and when i came back outside, all of the cop cars, ambulances and the firetruck were gone, with no sign of the incident happening.  I then called my mom and D's mom to let them know what happened.  We drove down to the hospital and found S and D.  S was in the lobby, they had shot him up with valium and he had no idea what had happened or why he was there.  D was in a bed strapped down screaming and jumping the bed up and down.  He was  yelling my name, but when the doctor had me stand over him he didnt recognize me.  



In the end D ended up being fine, except for all his physical injuries from being hit with a rock, and from a 5 minute police beating, he looked like he had been in a car crash, not a drug overdose, he remained in the hospital for 3 days.  S ended up not being charged with anything, and now all that is left is a bunch of upset parents.  D doesnt remember any of this, and it honestly seems like he doesnt believe us when he tells the story.  After doing this i cant stress enough how dangerous drugs can be, this was the most scary night of my life, and i keep seeing the images of us soaked in blood and D screaming and attackign everyone.  I will never touch drugs again, and for those of you who do, please please be careful on your doses. Im guessing we all took around 60 mg's, we all reacted differently, i was tripping but remained very aware of the situation, S just stopped paying attention and sort of passed out, D went on a insane rampage, worse then any PCP story i've heard of. Be careful with tryptamines, they can be very dangerous, and potentially life threatening.
