I've been using opiods off and on for several years now after being introduced to them after minor surgerey. My personal favorite is Hydrocodone, but I have tried the following: Oxycodone, Codeine, Propoxyphene, Opium and Methadone. I recently bought 21 5-500 Percocet's from my friends mom (she's the coolest) and had had a plan to make them last for a few weeks. Needless to say they didn't last anywhere near that time.



I have a very low tolerance to oxycodone so 10-20 is good for a fairly strong high. I took 15 mgs. a total of 3 Percocets at 7:30 on an empty stomach and took a bath and waited for them to hit. Within ten minutes of taking them I was starting to feel very relaxed and my whole body was starting to feel warm and tingly all over. Another ten minutes had passed and I never wanted to leave the bathtub, it was the ultimate relaxation and I felt like nothing was a problem anymore everything was at peace.



I finally got out of the bath and went to go watch some t.v. when my friend called to say he was coming over. This normally would bother me since opiates can make me a bit irritable, but I was fine with it. Me, my friend and brother just hung out and watched Trigun and played games for a few hours and it was great. My friend didn't seem to notice that I was on anything and it felt great just to hang out and do what we usually do, I just felt closer to people. My friend left and this was about three hours after taking the percocet and I had mostly come down, so I swollowed 2 more and crushed one and snorted it. From snorting the one, I felt it almost instantly, it was mild but still very nice. It burned my nose a little but not bad but it made my face and nose itchy. I played my bass for a while and found that ideas came more easily and I came up with better stuff than I could sober, I wish I could remember it though. I layed down and eventually fell asleep watching a movie, waking up periodically in a half dreaming state and try to watch to movie, only to fall asleep again. 



I got up the next day and took my usual 5 mg. of adderall and tried to get some homework done but couldn't. I felt so tired and had a headache and kept nodding off. I had forgotten that unlike hydrocodone, Oxycodone tends to make me very dope sick the next day and makes it hard to function. I took another half tab of adderall but that didn't help.



I had the option to not go to work that day and I took it but my head hurt and I felt like shit and I new only one thing would get rid of the dope sickness: More Percocet! I took 2 more and within 20 minutes my headache and nausea was gone and I felt great. I sat around for about 3 hours playing games and then left to go to the doctors. I took another 5mg of adderall, hoping to wake myself up a bit and drove to the doctors office.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



The drive was rather frightening because I was starting to come down and get very tired, I thought I might fall asleep at the wheel but I managed not to. When I got home it had been six hours since I had last taked any Percocets and I was feeling sick and my headache was back. I had a class that night but was afraid to drive again because I was so tired and figured I would just nod out in class so I stayed home and tried to sleep but couldn't. I took 3 more percocet and felt better soon after. I played some more games, and eventually passed out for a little while. I woke up, still pretty high, so I watched Big Fish, (I love Tim Burton movies when I'm on dope) popped 2 more percs, watched Pink Floyd's live a Pompei while fiddling with my bass, eventually drifting into a peaceful sleep. I didn't feel sick the next morning like I had the day before, but I had 8 percocet left and spent the whole day much like the day before. My friend came by later and I told him about the percocet and that he wanted some but I was out, so he just drank all my gin instead. We just sat around talking and watching movies until I went to sleep. 



The next day was hell, I was very tired and a little pissed that I let myself get out of control, I could have spread them out and gotten high a couple times a week for three weeks, but no, I had to go on an all out binge. I had made a few mistakes, 1. underestimating the drug and the hangover it would have the next day. 2. getting really high the night before I had school. 3. doing more percocet to get rid of the hangover, it only set me up for a short cycle up repeated use.  So I learned that I shouldn't do Oxycodone if I have any important responsibilties the next day, not to do more dope to get rid of the dope hangover cause it's just a trap. Also, occasional opiod use is fine, but anymore than 2 days is a bad idea for me because when the 3 days of being high was over it was terribly depressing. I already have bad depression so when it's completely gone for three days and then comes back, it hit's hard. Plus I was a little constipated which is never fun. But those three days were an amazing three days, it was quite the vacation.
