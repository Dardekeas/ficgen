A couple nights ago me and a friend wanted to try some Dramamine that I had picked up from the store the day before. We were really tired aleady because we had done ecstacy the night before although we found out later that it was MDE (which I actually like better because of the longer lasting time and the visuals you get in the end) So anyways J took his 12 pills and I took mine and There was another one of my friends there too watch us but he had to leave in 2 hours. So we put in the movie `My nieghbor Totoro' to pass time because I heard it takes about 2 hours to kick in. We started fealing drowsy in about an hour and felt slightly put of it. I kept seeing strange things out of the corner of the television also. We then deciding to go outside. This was about 2 hours after ingestion. 



Suddenly while outside I started getting the most amazing trails when I moved my hand. It seemed as if there were ten of my hands all moving and flickering in the light. Then I kept hearing my friend B talking and I would talk back and he would tell me he was never talking. Then I looked down at the end of my street and there were lots of kids skating around so I asked B (him being the sober one) If he could see them and he said there was nobody down there so I looked back and they were gone but my freind Alex was down there talking on his cell phone this also B said wasnt there. Then I saw the most amzing thing yet. I person with raver pants walked toward me in the dark started spinning and dancing and proceeded to grow into a giant and disappear. Yet all this seemed perfectly normal at the time, like it was no big deal. Then B had to leave and me and J went upstairs in my house.



By this point we both could not form words at all. The drowsiness was beginning to take over. I had planned to try smoking some salvia I had while on it but lacked all energy to go do it. Then we turned off the light and put the TV on that black and white dot fizzy channel and I saw the most incredible things in it. I saw millions of people running across the screen. Plus the entire time it seemed there were alot more people in there then just me and J. My 2 best friends kept coming in and I would talk to them for awhile but I wouldnt move my mouth. yet I could hear my voice out loud. It was if everything was real though. I saw a brontasaurus walk around my room then disappear and when I went downstairs to use the restroom I heard people talking in every room of the house but when I checked to see who it was there wasn't anybody there. Then only about 2 hours of tripping (so about 4 hours after talking the pills) I passed gave into the drowziness and passed out.



All in all I would say it is really weird yet really fun. If I try it again I want to try it with some kind of stimulant like acid or shrooms so I wont sleep. The funniest part was when I woke up and realized all the stuff I had saw since I thought most of it was real at the time of seeing it. I also kept seeing really strange things dor a couple days after especially if I smoked salvia or cannabis. I think everybody should at least try it once I know I will probably try once or twice more.
