Well, to begin with\ldots  I'm a heavy smoker smoking about 26-33 cigarettes a day. But despite this I never realized what a powerful euphoriant nicotine can be in sufficient amounts until I had my first experience with a nicotine inhalator. I started with a cardridge which contained a `filter' with nicotine in it (10 mg). I started to draw looong puffs for about half an hour then I thought it was time to replace the cardridge. 



During the beginning I sensed some archetypal signs of `being on something', distant silent voices and a slight paranoia which passed. I puffed away for an hour or so. Nothing spectacular. Then I decided I'd go see my downstairs neighbour. This was the best idea! Almost immediately at her presence (puffing all the time) I began to feel euphoric. I started to smile and the smiling turned into laughter. I felt as if there was no force in the universe that could bring me down or hurt me. I thought `this must be better than crack!' The high, and it definitely was one, though only lasted about 20 minutes but it was worth it. After that I tried to get back to that pleasurable feeling but no matter how hard I puffed -- No effect. So that's about it. I tried to renew my `best high ever' some weeks after but puffing for about half an hour produced nothing but a pretty depressing shower of thoughts -- no high whatsoever. 



All in all I learned to respect the nicotine in a new way and regard the experience as one of my all time highs -- ever. No paranoia or sometimes so dreadful expansion of the mind. Just pure solid euphoria - a `king' feeling.
