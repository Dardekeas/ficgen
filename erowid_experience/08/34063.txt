A friend of mine (A) left for the airforce, and was unable to bring the collection of drugs he had fermenting at his house.  Because of his air-force ties, he had loads and loads of legal drugs.  Strange ones.  A left me all he had when he left for the Air Force for good, and I found ground-up Acetophinimin and Benadryl tabs, bags of Periwinkle and lots of Robitussin.  And, strangely enough, a bottle of Wormwood.  I know a lot about Absinthe, but I had never seen the essential oil or wormwood.  I asked my friend how it felt when he drank it.  His answer `Like weed.'  But he says that about everything.  Anyways, inspired by a story I had heard of very stupid people dipping cigarettes in Ammonia and smoking them, I dripped about 3 drops onto a cigarette.  I set it on my dashboard while I picked up a friend (B) from his house.  While driving somewhere, we smoked it, and waited.  At first, I felt a head rush, inhalant-like, and didn't think much of it.  The friend and I sat, figuring the silly hippie chemical wouldn't work.  I turned to him and said `I feel something creeping in.'  He smiled and agreed.  



We began smiling and laughing, everything was clear and vivid.  The muscles on the side of my face were pulling my lips into a smile.  I couldn't even control it.  When most people think of Absinthe and thujone, they think of `tripping', but I find it more akin to cocaine or crystal meth.  I feel as if I can do anything.  I made more of those cigarettes to smoke with other friends, and now everyone is all over them.  I've been getting 50 cents per cig.  The only drawback I can see (although there is possible unseen harm.  It is a toxic essential oil) is that there is a tolerance.  It has never been the same as the first time.  I still recommend it.



About a week after discovering the smoking method, the same friend from before (B) and I came upon a bottle of Sprite and Everclear, a weird spur-of-the-moment thing.  I dropped 40 drops of Wormwood Oil, which of course sat atop the liquid, and we sucked it down.  I knew that the amount of liquor I had just had should've left me substantially drunk, but I wasn't.  I felt the freedom and frivolity of drunkenness, and the smiley joy and top-of-the-world feeling from thujone.  It leaves me energized.  It was a really fantastic feeling, but about three hours after drinking, I was dead tired.  More so than I ever have been after drinking before.  I feel asleep in my car in a parking lot for five hours, then went home and slept again.



Overall, I really enjoy thujone, more so than most illegal drugs, but I don't know the harms that I'm sure it is enacting on my body.
