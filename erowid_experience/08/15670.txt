It was a nice winter night and some frieds and I wanted to get high. I had just purchased a small bag of Passionflower from the local herb/occult store. Someone once told me that by smoking the dried flowers and leaves you get get high. We all walked out to the back yard and loaded the pipe. There were 4 of us, and I didn't think that it would affect us very much, if at all, but to my supprise, after smoking half the bag, we all began to experience slight light headedness and euphoria. We decided to take a couple more tokes. After about 2 more minutes we began to experience memory loss and mild paranoia along with slight hallucinations (seeing fairylike lights and strange colors in the corner of your eye, but not true visuals). A few minutes later the `peak' of the high was gone and it had dwindled down to a slight marijuana like high, but far less physical. A few minutes later, the high was just about gone and smoking more didn't help much. 



The whole experience lasted about 15-20 minutes and we were left with a nice friendly feeling of well being and harmony with our surroundings. over all it wasn't really worth the \$1.50, but could help if you are extremely desperate to get stoned. 



I have attempted to get high off Passionflower many times after that once, but have been unsuccesful.
