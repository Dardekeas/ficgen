I had heard about this drug that supposedly blows everything else out of the water- Oxycodone.  I had seen people doing it at parties, crushing up the pills and then snorting them and being laid out on a couch for the rest of the night.  I got some prescribed for an injury- and I began by taking the prescribed dose, 7.5 mg, a percocet.  



Anyway, my usage escalated to where I would do up to 80 mg snorted at one sitting.  I took a 25 mg Phenergan, 440 mg Aleve,  100 mg Benadryl, and 200 mg Ultram to smooth out the experience.  I had 80 mg of pure oxycodone laid out on the pocket mirror, rolled up my dollar bill, and embarked on my journey through heaven.  Within 30 seconds, I could feel the drugs begin to go to my head, but the first high I got was throughout my body- a general feeling of a kind of pleasant numbness.  I got the same feeling in my head, but it progressed into a complete euphoria.  By now, the people with me could see that I was in a different place than they were.  I turned on some Flaming Lips, with the visualization.  With all the lights out, I sat there for about an hour just enjoying the music and watching the visualization.  



My playlist ran out, but by then I was too high to really feel like doing anything to restart it, so I just sat and tripped out.  The feelings that I got, as well as the closed eye visuals, were indescribably beautiful and heavenly.  After two hours of pure heaven, I found myself feeling incredibly satisfied.  I didn't want any more, I felt just right.  So then, I just decided to go to sleep, and had some of the best sleep of my life.
