Over my life I have experienced a myriad of hallucinogens and empathogens. They have all taught me many valuable life lessons and helped me through some tough times; but after experiencing the majority of the classic compounds I have begun to look towards the research chemicals for new insight. This is the story of a compound about which little is known, a compound called Allylescaline.

     

Today is a special day, the day of the first annular solar eclipse in some thirteen years. It was decided that on this day, I would try this new compound along with my good friend Aurora, who is also well versed in the use of psychedelics. 



130 mgs of Allylescaline was received from a trusted online vendor a few days prior to our experiment. On the morning before the eclipse, the 130 mgs of Al HCL was dissolved in 6.5 mL of DI water to produce a 10mg/0.5mL solution. Our plan is to take the AL around mid-day, giving us time to get to know the effects before heading up to the mountains to watch the eclipse, which was predicted to occur around 6:28 PM.



12:20 PM (T + 0:00): Aurora and I each consumed 10 mgs of Al by dropping 0.5 mL of the solution into a small glass of water and drinking it.

12:25 PM (T + 0:05): Strange bubbly feelings appear in my stomach, it could be a placebo, but Aurora agrees that she has it too.

1:15 PM (T + 0:55): I feel relaxed and mildly euphoric, but that is most likely pre-trip excitement that comes with trying a new compound.

1:30 PM (T + 1:10): We just consumed an additional 10 mgs of AL; I'm starting to feel a bit off baseline but not much. If it is anything like mescaline, it will still be about an hour until any major effects present themselves. The mild stomach feelings return again after taking another dose and my body is starting to feel tingly.

1:50 PM (T + 1:30): My vision is starting to become a bit fuzzy, like an old Television with bad reception, along with a mild, but very positive mood boost. Aurora confirms this and we notice some pupil dilation.

Alexander Shulgin was right about the come up in his entry in PIHKAL. It is very gradual and graceful. No anxiety what so ever, I just feel very relaxed and presently blissful. The only alterations to my vision are a brightening of colors.



2:15 PM (T + 1:55): My perception of color has been greatly intensified, and everything in my field of vision is slowly rocking back and forth as if our living room was on a boat.

2:50 PM (T + 2:30): Colors continue to become more vibrant (especially pink) and I feel like I'm entering into the phenylethylamine headspace I love so much.

3:00 PM (T + 2:40): We consumed another 10 mgs making 30 mgs of Al total. So far this seems to be a highly color oriented trip. Everything is so bright, accompanied with a feeling of very warm positive energy. 

3:15 PM (T + 2:55): The strange stomach feelings return, but it doesn't bother me in the least as I feel fantastic.

My body feels so alive with positive energy that flows with all the colors in the spectrum, slightly reminiscent of MDMA, but way more colorful and lacking the amphetamine ``push''. I am a solid ++ at the moment. Also music sounds like it has so much more depth, euphoric trance is defiantly a great music choice for this experience. Smoking hookah is fantastic. 

3:40 PM (T + 3:20): Just took 10 more mgs.



4:20 PM (T + 4:00): Seems like a good time to take another 10mgs of Al.

4:35 PM (T + 4:15): Eating on Al is not a problem at all; in fact it makes my sub sandwich taste superb.

5:30 PM (T + 5:10): Aurora and I take the rest of our Al, making a grand total of 65 mgs each as we prepare to head to the mountains to watch the eclipse.

5:35 PM (T + 5:15): Since we have not been able to get past a ++ with AL alone we decide to add 250 Î¼g of 25C-NBOMe, this is done by administering 50 Î¼L of water intranasally. We then get in the car to head to the mountains, since I am tripping my fiancÃ© Moonflower drives us up to the trailhead, on the way there the road and everything on it looks like it is computer animated, like Jimmy Neutron lol.

6:00 PM (T + 5:40): We arrive at the trail head and meet up with a bunch of other good friends and we all start the hike up.

6:28 PM (T + 6:08): After a short but very steep hike our group had reached the spot we picked out, some colossal boulders which overlooked the valley we just traversed. This spot had an excellent, unhindered view of the sky, perfect for some eclipse viewing. We got there just in time because the moon had just started to touch the sun. 

Looking down at the city from our high perch, it almost looked as if the whole city had stopped in its tracked to watch the eclipse; every parking lot I could see was completely full. People were even parked on the sides of the main roads to watch this special celestial event.



6:40 PM (T + 6:15): The moon is quickly moving in front of the sun making it look like sunset, even though the sun is still somewhat high in the sky. We all take another 250 Î¼gs of 25C-NBOMe and smoke a few bowls of cannabis as we watch the moon eclipse the sun with our special glasses.

7:33 PM (T + 7:13): The moon has completely moved in front of the sun sending the entire city into twilight, glancing at the eclipsed sun produced an explosion of prismatic ribbons of light and geometric patterns that lingered for ten seconds or so. This was the moment that the effects of the Al and 25C were at their peak. A definite +++.

At the moment of the total eclipse the whole city rang out with a cry of excitement, which echoed through the valley and filled the air with delight. It filled me with a loving feeling of total unity to be witnessing this cosmic event that has captivated human kind as long as we have walked this Earth. For those four minutes that the moon and the sun became one, so did everyone watching it. We were no longer individuals separated from each other, it didn't matter who we were or where we were in life. We had all gathered to see this event as humans, as all humans have since we first looked up at the sky. This is the universe's way of reminding us that we are all connected, individual islands that are joined beneath the ocean.



7:38 PM (T + 7:18) Once the moon started to move past the sun I came back to normal reality, barely able to fathom what just happened. As the moon moved away from the sun it seemed almost like another sunrise was happening, as light returned to the valley. We decided that is was a good time to head down, before the sun actually set; as tripping in the dark off the trail in the woods can be dangerous. Once we picked up the trail the 2/3 sun was setting, and it was the most beautiful sunset I had ever seen. Looking at the moon-shaped sun on the horizon and seeing the sky filled with radiant violets, oranges, and yellows made me fill so blessed to be privileged to live here on planet Earth. After the sun set the valley became polka-dotted with the bright white flowers of Datura that open right after sunset. As I looked at them I thought ``someday I will try it, but not until I'm ready''. We all piled back into the car and headed home. We were still in complete awe as to what we had just experienced, as we walked back inside. ``It almost feels weird to be back in the city after all that.'' I said. 



We continued to trip for a couple more hours, and smoked hookah until we were too tired to keep our eyes open. All our friends headed home as the psychedelics had long worn off and Moonflower and I went to bed; I had no trouble sleeping at all. What an epic day!



Extensions and Commentary:

Allylescaline is a very mild and gentle psychedelic; it would be a great option for any beginner to the world of hallucinogens, as it has little if any negative side effects. It would also be a great addition to any other trip that you would like to be more colorful and empathetic. All in all it is a great compound, thanks Alexander Shulgin!
