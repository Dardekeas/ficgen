I had just gotten back from the city were I picked up some heroin and coke from the city.(coke for friends dope for me)  I never had tried heroin before, and was nervous so I started small, I cut a small bump out and snorted it, it burned my nose and tasted nasty.  



Within 15 minutes I started feeling warm and euphoric, like I had eaten 20 mgs of oxycodone so I decided to take another bump.  A half an hour went by and I felt like I was on top of the world, this was the greatest feeling I've ever felt, better then ecstacy, I felt like I was sitting next to a fire in the winter and all my problems didn't matter, none of the pains that are present in everyday life were present.  



I felt this way for about 4 hours then I took another bump and I felt just as good.  The next day I was back to normal, I didn't have a hangover or anything, but this experince is something I will never forget, I want to get more today, but I know and have seen how easy addiction can creep in, so I will try to space it out like once a month, a once in a blue moon type thing.
