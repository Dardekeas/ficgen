I have been enjoyin subscription opiates for a while now, mainly in the form of codine or hydrocodone.  Recently I became interested in making poppy tea to try morphine.  I ordered 65 dried poppy pods off of an online store for 14 bucks.  They were the smaller `mini' pods which are rumored to be not as potent as the regular.  However I found that they were very potent indeed.  I ground all the poppy pods up in a blender until it was all powder and then weighed out 12 grams.  I added the poppy powder to hot water and let it steep over night.  I also added some lemon juice from fresh lemons for the acetic acid content that in theory should have changed a very small amout of the morphine molecules to diacetylmorphine (heroine).  



The next day I strained the tea and drank it all at once.  In about 40 minutes I was feeling pretty high and relaxed.  In an hour an a half I was totally at peace with the universe and completley content to lye on my coach and listen to relaxing new age music all day\ldots  and thats exactly what happend. I took the poppy tea around 1:00 p.m. and I was still feeling pretty damm high and still had constricted pupils at 3:00 a.m. that night.  I had a great time but I hade no idea that the effect would last that long. All in all it was a great expierence but make sure to clear alot of time for the expierence because it can last for over 12 hours.
