Well, I woke up, and SURPRISE! I was totally high off my ass! It was like 6:30am. I had taken a little nutmeg at appx. 6:00pm the night before, and didn't think that anything was happening (about an inch in the bottom of a plastic cup, washed down with water). I must have been asleep whenever the stuff took effect. I was on my way to the shower when I realized that reality was a bit different than normal. I think that I woke up at the peak. I went to work (serving tables at a resort). By lunch (noon) things were still pretty weird, by dinner (6:00pm) I had a very mild headache that dissapeared every now and then with the effects coming back occasionally. I was still messed up when I went to sleep for the night, woke up fine the next day.



The effect was somewhat like being high on pot, especially when trying to drive. I just kept driving over and over the same spot on the road, in my mind. Time was way slowed down. I didn't want to talk to anybody. I didn't want to work fast. I just wanted to sit down, and maybe take a nap. While working it was like I was actually in a dream, only what was in front of me directly was normal, everything peripheral and behind me was distorted in my mind, similar but not the same as reality, like in a dream. I would think things like `it is really sunny,' but it wouldn't be, or that `the porch is 20 feet of off the ground with the forest below,' but actually the porch was only 4 feet off of the ground and the forest was across the parking lot.



Overall, a good experience. I wouldn't suggest trying if you have to work the next day. Pick a day that you can sit around and drink lemonade or something.
