Rather than go into detail about my drug history, I would like to start the report by noting that prior to using Tramadol I was using several narcotics, including oxycodone, hydrocodone, and propoxyphene.



I liked the effects of these drugs but some of the side effects were too much for me. I wasn't the once in a while user of them either. I would use opiates for as low as few days and up to a few weeks. Every time I suffered a very unpleasant withdrawal with symptoms such as nausea, depression, and tremor.



One day I got a hold of four Tramadol pills. I allergy tested myself (waited two hours) with one and then took the other 3. The result was a non-sedated Euphoria with a stronger pain-killing property than any narcotics I've ingested to date. I was so happy. I met this girl (she ended up being a total hippie.) who kept hugging me and quite literally wouldn't let go. I felt awesome. Not sure if it was the Tramadol or my new hippie friend but I'd like to say it was a good combination. 



Besides the social setting, I think Tramadol is still the drug of choice over narcotics. Not only is it less sedating (to me), but I experienced no unpleasant withdrawal.
