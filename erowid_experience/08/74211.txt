Wasn't sure what the dose would be classed as, as the africans we get our khat from call it kilos though it is far off being a kilo. One bunch wrapped in a banana leaf would be mild effects for two people. 



The first time I experienced khat I tried one bunch chewed between 2pm and 8pm. It seemed to creep up as time went on and not knowing what to expect decided to stop chewing as I didn't want to be up all night. Was similiar to amphetamine but not as intense was very talkative similiar and had some mild rushes and managed to get a sleep, so for a first experience very positive results.



The next few times we realised if you get some gum in your mouth the plant material will join to the gum making it a lot easier on the gums. Is great for a pick me up and goes great with alcohol and cannabis for an enjoyable evening. Makes you very chatty like amphetamine and gives you stamina but without the nasty side effects of amphetamine. Only down side is the sore jaw after chewing all day. Cannabis and alcohol seem to work great with it. Think alcohol could potentiate it and cannabis makes it quite psychedelic.



We've worked out for best effects and to make it easier on the jaws try and chew as much as possible in 20-40 minutes then replace with more plant material. If we want nice effects well chew a few leaves then have some alcohol and continue chewing through the night when required. One night I combined it with alcohol cannabis and a few lines of cocaine and went to a drum and bass night. I had chewed all in maybe three bundles and was pretty wired with it, though in a good way not like amphetamines and the 3 lines of cocaine and a good few drinks added to a good experience. Went to the club and felt like I was on ecstasy after dancing for a few hours, much better than the crappy ecstasy tablets that are going around here, plus its natural unlike ecstasy. You don't get any comedown and you usually manage to get a sleep so a great alternative to amphetamine and mdma, well I can't get mdma just pills that claim to be that, so much better than them.



So all in a great plant that I can take in many different situations and have good experiences, highly enjoyable!! Though a lot of the somalians here are addicted to it so it could become habit forming but my jaws just can't take all that chewing a few days in a row, need a few days to get my jaw to get back to normal.
