I am writing to help those who have had heavy psychedelic experiences!! I got very sick one time from drinking Ayahuasca. I though I would be sick for life. Once I got sick I didnt waste any time trying to heal the hell I was going through. I went to healers and did 3 to 4 day juice fasts but it helped very little. So I spoke to a Shaman I knew and he told me that the best thing for me was to drink more ayahusaca. He said that it was possible that something I had done at the time had reacted badly with the ayahuasca. So I think it was having sex!!! No one told me before the ayahuasca ceremony that I was not to have sex 3 days before and 3 days after the ceremony. So I remember possible having sex with my girlfriend on the very morning of the night of the ceremony. Also things like St Johns wort or any mind medication like sleeping tablets or depression pills will cause a very bad reaction with the Ayahuasca.

So I took his advice yet I was so terrified of getting even worse. 



The first ceremony I drank just a little and I felt better the next day but still a long way from being healed. So the Shaman told me I had to go deep and drink a lot the next time so I did and I had the biggest healing I ever had and felt 100\% again.
