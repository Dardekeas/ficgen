I had heard much about using and abusing Adderall to get a high which was exactly like speed. This intrigued me, at the time I was an avid user of drugs, and speed just felt like another notch in my belt. Many of my friends had prescriptions, so the stuff was very easy to obtain. A co-worker had 15mg pills prescribed to her, I asked her for 5 thinking they would last me. I did more reading after getting the Adderall and realized I would require a dose of 20-30mg to really feel the effects. I decided since if it was a speedy focused high, the best time to take it would be right before school.



I woke up 6:30 am, strangely not feeling tired at all. I had time before I had to catch the bus to school. I sat and thought about my dose for a while. I decided the effects would be more prominent and noticeable at a higher dose. I quickly crushed up 2 and a half pills adding up to about 37mg. It was allot of orange powder to snort, but I did it. At first everything tasted like adderall (usual with snorting stuff) the stuff burned pretty bad, worse then cocaine. The burn lasted for a few minutes then dulled away. I pocketed the other 2 an a half pills and headed out. About a second later I started coming up.



I was on the bus listening to melodic rocky music (afi - sing the sorrow) and I began feeling mild mood lift. The feeling slowly grew into a general Euphoria; I felt a body high with intense relaxation. Yet even with my body so relaxed and high my mind was very active and awake. Instead of being my usual anti-social self I removed my headphones and began engaging in conversations with kids on the bus. Keep in mind it's about 7AM, and I am jumping all over the place talking to everybody. Needless to say, it was a little more than a wake up. 



I was constantly feeling good about myself. It's as if I knew all the right things to say, and everybody enjoyed talking to me. Instead of being unsure or shy like my usual self, I was outgoing, witty, confident, cocky, happy, and most of all focused! Normally I never ever do work in class and have no desire to work or pay attention. With adderall, I couldn't not pay attention in class; everything I was doing seemed interesting. I had a math test second period and I flew through it. Doing each problem like it actually mattered and trying my very best to solve each one. I walked away with my first A in years and a new found confidence in my academic abilities.



The only negative effect I felt while actually high was that I couldn't stop pissing. I think this has to do with the amount of water I drank to eliminate the dry mouth. The Euphoria and Confidence were going on and on until about 8th period when I started coming down. It wasn't intense, but I had read about intense comedowns, and began to get worried. Most sites said the high lasts about 6 hours which was pretty accurate, at least at my dose. I decided to take the other 37mg for fear of losing the euphoria, also I was supposed to meet a girl I liked after school and I feared being my shy and anti-social self around her. I ran to the bathroom before ninth period and insufflated the last 2\&1/2 pills.



The first thing I noticed was that the burn hurt much less, barely noticeable. There was a 5 minute wait of jittering and such before it kicked in again. I felt the warmth of the amphetamine high go through my whole body. It was less intense this time but still quite present. Instead of enjoying the Euphoria it seemed to dissipate fast. I was still high, I know because I was still witty and confident when I met the girl I liked after school. I was able to talk allot and keep a captivating conversation like before, only the good feeling was gone, I felt less high and more focused.



Another 6 hours of this passed and I had no real comedown. I sat on my computer for most of the night, still focused. I slept that night, but it took me about an hour to fall asleep. My body was as relaxed as possible but my mind is still racing.



All in all I had a good experience on Amphetamines. I compare the high to cocaine high, but expanded for 6 hours. I don't think the human mind or body can handle being as active as I was for the whole day, so taking more didn't really help. I have read much about negative side effects such as dependency tolerance, but I think I would defiantly do the drug again in a heartbeat.
