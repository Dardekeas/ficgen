 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



Bought 10g of MDAI from a supplier in the UK. Was a bit worried when it took a few days extra to make it down here to Australia.



The package was a bit questionable. Weight (g) and `MDAI' and that's it. No info on purity or even the full drug name (not that that's a guarantee of good product). Ordered it from the very first supplier that popped up on Google when I typed it in. The website looked legit. Heaps of payment options and a refund/returns policy. Was quite cheap though (14 pounds/gram).



It is a very fine white powder with little smell, maybe a little bit sour. The taste isn't too strong either but there is a bitter after taste similar to a pill or speed, but still different.



Just trying it at home with a mate. We're both about 70kg and have been taking pills/speed on average once a month for about 5 years. We both take on average 3 pills/session but can still feel the effects of one pill. Take coke a few times a year and have tried acid, mushies and had a fair bit of mephedrone last years when we ordered 10g. I miss those days. =(



T=0hr. Dropped 300mg each in a cap



T=10min. My mate reckons he can start to feel something mild, but may just be excited. Nothing for me yet.



T=45min. Still nothing. Bought some wine. Snorted 100mg each. Didn't burn at all. Not sure if its even MDAI.



T=1:30hr. Had one glass of wine. Swallowed another 300mg each. Feeling a mild fuzziness.



T=2:00hr. Feeling nice. Relaxing on couch watching the MJ DVD. Stretching feels nice and very mild jaw clenching.



T=2:30hr. Feeling pretty spaced out - just staring at shit. Feels good but still pretty mild. Pretty horny. Probs gonna go to bed soon.



Will keep you posted if anything changes. Hope this report helps. Defs need more info on taste and smell of MDAI to make sure its actually what the package says.



Going to a festival this weekend so will try it with speed and report back. Effects should be a lot more apparent when you've got both serotonin and dopamine getting released (hopefully).
