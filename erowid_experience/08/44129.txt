 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



At the time of the experiance I was 16 years old, a senior in high school. I was at my cousin's house, where she, her brother, a couple of her friends, and myself would gather on weekends to play poker, drink, smoke, and just hang out. That particular evening was a Sunday evening, and being that I had school the next day, I wasn't drinking (nor smoking). I was discussing drugs with my cousin, and we came to inhalants. She told me that when she was younger, she and a couple of her friends inhaled 4 cans of glade and got messed up. She then offered me to try it. I accepted the offer, thinking it couldn't be so bad if she's done that much and she's fine. I was wrong.



She brought me into her bedroom, gave me the can and a towel, and told me to fold the towel a couple of times, put it over the top of the can, spray and inhale the gas. And so I did. About 5 seconds after the first hit, I could feel a bit dizzy, my vision had a slight delay in catching up when I would turn my head, and I got a feeling of heat in my palms, feet, and crotch. A few hits later the effects became rather intense. My ears started ringing, everything seemed more colorful, my vision was delayed to such an extent that I would see what I was looking at only a second or two after I turned my head towards it. When moving I felt as if operating a machine rather than moving my own body. Much like the vision delay, I would only feel oriented with my body's new position a few seconds after I would move.



The effects dissapated over time, and in about an hour I was normal again. The next day, in school, I was sitting at my desk in first period, and suddenly felt the effects of the glade returning. They were not as strong as the night before. I put my head down, hoping it would go away, and after about 2 or 3 minutes, it did. 20 minutes later, the period was over, I got up and walked out the door, and surely enough, no more than a few steps from the door, the effects returned. This time, they were much stronger. At that point I didn't know what to do, so I went to the nurse, and said I was not feeling well, and would like to rest a bit. She agreed, and I layed down to rest for the period. After 40 minutes, I felt as good as new, and went to my 3rd period class, during which I felt ok. When the period was over, I got up from my desk, and instantly felt the glade high again. It went on and off for the rest of the day. By the time I got home, I was pretty much panicked. The next days proceeded much like the first, except every day the effects would be weaker, and less frequent, and in 4 days they were completely gone.



In conclusion, this is one experience that I will never forget, and never repeat.
