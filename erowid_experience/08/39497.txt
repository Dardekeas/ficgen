I became hooked on DXM because I dislike alcohol.  I liked that I wanted to do physical activity for long hours and that I did not have to eat very much when doing the drug. I was so hooked that I found a pill called DexAlone.  Obviously, it was highly attainable and not against the law.  I had always been hooked on trying to loose weight which the drug allowed.  



I yearned to see other dimensions.  I had soul searching to do some may call it self- medicating. The fact that I woke up happy and exhilarated with no hangover made me think I was not ruining myself.  



One night very far into my addiction, I took one bottle of cough syrup and downed it.  Because I had not ordered any pills. Not realizing I took another bottle and downed it because I was too wasted in Wonderland to realize it. Then I got severe facial paralysis.  This scared me because I realized the drug was starting to effect my ability to talk when I was sober.  Then I knew my heart was not acting right and I felt a gagging feeling in my throat like a knot.



I could not go to the emergency ward because there was no one that could drive me.  I called a good friend that lived several hours away that I could confide in and explained how foolish I had been.  My friend told me to see the whole thing through awake.  Falling asleep at such a time could be a fatal mistake. I spent 8-10 hours or more lying trying to control my heart beat.



My arms and legs fell asleep as I walked for months after the incident.  My bones became weak. Then I detected a large lump in my throat.  The weight I had lost rushed back on because I could not digest properly.  In short, 2 years later I am starting to return to normal although I have a goiter in my neck.  It the result of hypothyroidism.  And I suffer from lung repression as well. I see black spots out of my right eye because I blew a blood vessal behind it during my nearly fatal overdose.



This abuse all happened within a 6month period but it effects appear to be permenant.
