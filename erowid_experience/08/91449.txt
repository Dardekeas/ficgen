This will be a description of my first time with 5-MeO-MIPT. I have previously had experience with LSD, MDMA, 2C-I, Mushroom, and Ketamine. I tend to have a higher threshold for drugs than most, so that's something to keep in mind. Finally, I was not currently on any other drugs during my trip.



It was later in the night when I dosed myself, around 11pm. Dosing was 10mg previously weighed out on a scale and put into a single gel cap. I had just eaten dinner so I was on a full stomach and had decided to just stay in my apartment for the duration since this was my first time on the drug. I was really looking forward to what was to come after reading about various experiences and hearing from some friends that had taken in previously.



At T-0:45 I began to feel a slight body buzz. It was nothing uncomfortable and felt like the beginnings of a come up on MDMA or acid for me. It was slight but noticeable. Just five minutes later the feeling was much increased. I began feeling very warm and was having a rush of energy. There was also a very strong feeling of muscle tension throughout my body, particularly my arms. It was far more powerful on 5-MeO-MIPT than I have felt on any drug. It was just shy of uncomfortable for me and would persist more or less for the rest of the trip. Fortunately, I did not experience any nausea from this drug as some people do.



At T-1:10 I began to see some slight visualizations. The popcorn ceiling of my apartment was having some waviness to it but never approached the visuals of an LSD or a 2C-I trip. While the visuals were a bit less than I was wanting the increased tactile sensations were great. I was barefoot and walking on my carpet and it felt very `squishy.' Textures also felt very good, akin to MDMA.



Overall, my trip felt something more in line with a MDMA trip than a normal psychedelic. I had the increased energy and tactile sensations I have had from MDMA, but with far less of the feeling of openness and the wanting to be social. I also felt the `sexually interesting' effect of this drug. Sex is nothing short of amazing on this drug. My girlfriend had also dosed at the same time as me and we decided to take advantage. Orgasms are intensified and it seemed there was less of a refractory period for me while on this drug. One downside was that at times things felt too intense for my girlfriend. 5-MeO-MIPT also increased my appreciation for music. I played some psytrance and dubstep during my trip and both clicked well with this drug.



Around somewhere around T-4:30 I began to notice the start of a gradual comedown. My muscles began to relax and unwind while the rush of energy I had declined. There wasn't a real crash but rather a gentle, constant comedown. I noticed the return of the wavy visuals this time which I found unusual. There was also some patterning when I looked at the wood grain floor of my bathroom. I had some slight trouble getting to sleep though I think some of the reason for this was the excitement for having such a positive trip on a new drug. It's now the morning and I was able to get a few hours of sleep and feel fine, with no hangover. 



A few closing thoughts: I absolutely had a great experience with this drug. I was hoping for some more visuals but I'm guessing I would require a higher dose. The other effects were great and I can't wait to experiment more with this substance.
