[Erowid Note: This report is marked as a JWH-018 report, but readers should be aware that no JWH series designation was presented by the author, and the actual substance mentioned could have been one of others in the JWH series.]  



A few times, I had taken 2ce, this is definatly one of the wildest trips that I have ever had, once I remember I was watching ICarly, (dunno why, it just had a excellent vibe), but anyways, I was playing with this slap hand, that constantly keep melting into goo all over my hands, I couldnt beleive how real it felt when this thing was melting in my hand. Then I glance up at the tv and icarly is a mirrage of rainbow colors that start dripping off of the tv screen, I was so confused and still stonished at what I was seeing, I never had visuals on acid or shrooms or anything like this. 



I remember after the colors drained off the tv I looked and there was a black guy on tv, his skin turned straight up blue. And his head turned into a dragon / lizard head. He got yellow cat eyes, and smiled really huge like a the shark on finding nemo namned bruce.  I was like OMGGGG!  Then it went away after I got distracted. 



Smoking jdubb(JWH) on this was insane, it made the body buzz super intence kinda similar to an opium body buzz but I was just trippin balls!, every hit made the walls drip down to the carpet, we then needed some weed and went to the river front to get it, I saw this bag of mids that my friends have just bought and it was bleeding red liquid that was coming from all the red hairs, and it was bleeding all over the concrete everywhere,  after I about fell down looking at the magnificanse, I looked at the sky and it was a huge checkerboard.  I have all kinds of crazy trips on this shit, sky changing vivid colors very quickly like the rainbow mode thing on the old n64 turok game. 



Good times good times indeed.
