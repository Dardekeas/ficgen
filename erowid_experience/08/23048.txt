Two of my good friends and I were sitting around one night, trying to think of things to do, and since we aren't very imaginative, we immediatly thought, `What kind of drugs can we do?' So, Steve told us he had AMT, but not a lot of it, only 15 mg for each of us. I enjoy trying different drugs so I said, `Yes!' Steve and Rob emptied the capsules into small glasses of water and drank it quickly, complaining of a very bitter `chemical' flavor. After watching them, I decided to empty the pill directly down my throat and chase it with water. I did not taste anything.



We sat around, smoked some pot and waited for it to take effect. I had not eaten anything that day and I can remember being scared that the AMT would make me sick, but it was such a small dose that I think it may have just absorbed into my system faster. It crept up on me within a period of about two hours although I didn't feel the full effects until about an hour after that. 



My friends and I decided to get some green tea from a local Chinese restaurant. Walking there was a very pleasant experience, but when we got the tea, I found I didn't really want to put anything else in my stomach because I had no appetite at all. So we just walked back to the house. 

The rest of the night was really nice, I had a mellow trip with pleasant `feathery' hallucinations. All very natural feeling. I didn't get sick, but I did clench my jaw, and it was sore for the next few days. It lasted a bit long for my taste because I couldn't get to sleep all that night and had a lot of trouble relaxing due to the constant tensing and releasing of my muscles. It was still nice though to have the small waves of hallucinations as I was coming down and the sun was coming up. I remember looking out the window and seeing a bare tree against a rich blue sky. It's leafless branches unfurled and rewound as if there were a fisheye lense moving slowly back and forth among them. 



The only thing I didn't really like about AMT was the tiredness. I felt really sluggish for the next few days and I wish I had more time to recoup. But all around I think the small dose was pleasant and facinating.
