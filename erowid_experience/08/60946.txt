 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



I was at my friend `Clarks' and we were smoking some bud and he said if you take Zoloft it will enhance the effects of the pot.  Being the dumass I was I took 15 100 mg pills in the space of about 2 hours.  This was around 8 pm.  I didn't feel anything for awhile, just high from taking bong hits.  I stayed the night there and it was the worst night of my life.



I woke up and I saw my friend Clark standing on the steps with a device that I thought he was trying to kill me with.  I looked up at the ceiling and a giant net was coming down over my head, controlled by my friend of course, and I started waving it away.  I looked over and Clark wasn't there anymore.



The next day is still a blur to me.  Apparently I started rambling about how everyone was out to get me and I wasn't safe anymore.  I was smoking lots of pot to try to calm down but it wasn't working well.  Clark called a doctor and he said I was suffering from schitzofrania.  Later that day I calmed down enough to go home.



I have never been the same since that night.  I hear voices in my head and sometimes I'll see someone and then their not there.  I hear people calling my name all the time, but their not.  I have the symptoms of a paranoid schitzofranic and I blame the zoloft.  I wish I could go back and undo that terrible night, but I can't.
