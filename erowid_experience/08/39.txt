 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 

In college my friends Craig, Erik, Todd and myself decided to purchase 4 cans of Freon from the local auto parts store and inhale one can per person.  I won't go into the details of anyone's experience save for Craig.

Immediately after inhaling the Freon he began to salivate and speak like `Lucifer'\ldots no lie!  His voice became very deep and onimous and he began babbling this and that\ldots that is, nothing profound enought to capture my attention as I was under the influence myself.  Then he said something I will never forget, `Look, I'm a plane!'

He extended his arms from his side and began to run around in circles.  The joy on his face was readily obvious, that is until he `crash landed' onto his face with his tongue sticking out.  Needless to say we had him to the hospital to repair his tongue which was severed.

All in all, I would not recommend Freon to the light hearted.  And it may just be moot as you currently need a license to purchase it anyway.  As Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five once said, `\ldots don't do it!'
