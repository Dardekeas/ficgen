Ok this incident was the first and last time I tried Datura:



9:30: I succesfully find the plant and pluck about five mature leaves and two of the spiky fruits. At about 9:45 im brewing some tea with all the leaves and seeds.



10:00: I brewed the tea strong until it was dark black. I drank about half a mug and thats it.



10:30: It hits me. HARD. Everytime i stand up it feels like an intense force of gravity is pulling me down. I am forced to sit back down. After this i only remeber bits and pieces but very specificly. I lost complete track of time and i was tripping and hallucinating intensly.



I found my self falling in and out of reality and dreams\ldots . It feels as though i was living two lives.



One incident happened where i get out of bed in my dream state and open the bathroom door and i see my dad behind the sink adjusting some pipes\ldots  the thing is that my dad had left at 9:00am in the morning for work. Thats all i remember\ldots  then i find myself going to the bathroom again in a semi-dream state and i see the water running and the bathroom flooded. (And i had done this without realizing what happened) VERY strange now that i think about it.



Another incident that i was smoking imaginary cigarettes and when i woke i found myself holding a pack. I still dont see how this happened. 



This is all i remeber\ldots . it was as if i had gone through two days of my life but it had only been about ten hours\ldots .. I was stupid and acting retarded for about two days after my trip. Also note that during my trip i would walk around semi-concious nowing i was awake but still asleep\ldots  i have to admit though i felt very powerful for some reason and i liked it. Also i remember talking to people and hearing myself talking to people who werent there\ldots  for instence a good friend of my `A' was standing by my bathroom and i said `whats up' and waved to her and she waved back\ldots  but shes in Germany\ldots  



This is the strangest incident.. This happened when i was semi-concious\ldots  I get up outta bed and ask my dad if he wants a drink\ldots  i go down to the kitchen bring up two beers and sit down on my chair and repeatedly tell my dad to take his drink i saw him walking around but he wouldnt reply. Again my dad had left at 9:00am in the morning\ldots  This was so strange i actually laugh now when i think about it. There more but im too tired to type.



Though i wont try Datura again I have to say i underestimated its power\ldots  I now respect the drug and i may try it again (maybe) with my friends and a sitter.



A word of advice: If anyone is thinking of trying Datura please go slow, have a little and see how you feel. If you feel you need more gradually increase the dosage. ALWAYS ALWAYS have a sitter. I know if i had i wouldnt have done such stupid shit\ldots  I feel quite embarrest now, when i think of what i did. Anyways go enjoy the 'Datura: The Holy Drug (i consider it this cause it really changed me in a way i cant describe).
