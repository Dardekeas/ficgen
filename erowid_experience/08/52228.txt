When in my freshmen year of college I found a way to obtain many benzodiazepines for .20\$ a mg, I began to obtain very large quantities of rivotril (1000-1500MG) on a weekly basis. After about a year of this, I had become addicted and was taking large quantities, the largest I have ever heard of. By the end of my use I was up to 20MG-30MG a day. When I finally went to a rehabilitation centre, my doctor did not initially believe me.



I initially was taking doses of 1-2MG for desired affects. As this went on for years, my doses increased to 20-30MG. These doses were unheard of by anyone I have ever experienced. With the large doses came extremely harsh side effects. I had a feeling of my extremities `going to sleep' at almost all times, severe problems sleeping, agitation at all times. 



At the first doses I noticed a great loss of inhibition, drowsiness, muscle relaxation, increased aggitation and anger especialy when combined with alcohol, prolonged sleep periods. The effects were almost identical to alprazolam/xanax except the increased anger and agitation. Many of my friends noticed this as one of the more undesireable affects of the drug. I have also experienced and increase in prolonged affects, such as depressed feelings for 24-48 hours.



Detoxing and life after this large abuse are difficult. I have very poor circulation and the same loss of feeling in the extremities when my heart rate is increased. 

I felt it was important to share this experience as I feel it is very unique and a good information source for people who feel benzos are a safer alternative to other drugs, as I thought. I feel long-term negative results of this prolonged and large addiction to a benzodiazepines.
