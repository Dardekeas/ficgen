2 am - swallowed 2.5 mg DOB.  it was a pale yellow liquid.  the taste was sort of alcoholesque.  i have the standard `o my, what have i done to myself' feeling now that i have actually swallowed it.  i also seem to always get a huge body shiver the moment after i dose any psychedelic.



2:30 - perhaps the first alerts?  my balance is a bit off.  i also seem to have a strange energy in my arms and chest.  i also have a familliar cottonmouth feeling that i get from psychs.



2:45 - definite alerts, but i can't really put my finger on what they are.  at this point i would compare it to lsd.  i have an urge to get up and walk around.  i can tell that my note-taking will not last much longer. 



3:00 - starting to buzz rather heavily.  i am getting scatter-brained, it is hard for me to focus on any one task.  getting hints of tracers out of the corner of my eyes.



3:15 definately tripping now.  more notes later?



well, i write the rest of this at about 8 pm.  i have at this point returned to nearly baseline, except for a clear buzz.



at about 4 am i went to +4.  i am left with inadequate words to properly describe the experience.  as my mind left my body i entered a state of euphoria that was like a 2 hour orgasm, except that an orgasm was a mere shell of this total euphoria.  my mind left my body and i became one with the universe.  



the visuals were kaliedescopic in nature, continuously morphing into different forms.  i saw fractal-type patterns everywhere.  the visuals were astoundingly complex and clear, and i could zoom in and out of the visuals with ease.



at 4:10 i made an attempt to write some notes in a notepad i had on hand.  the first note is labelled `4:10 - severe time distortion'.  the next page says `4:10 - time still distorted', so that may tell you just how distorted time actually felt.  the peak experience felt like it took a year, instead of about 2.5 hours.



the only analogy i can think of to characterize it is how hellen keller described her dreams.  she called them `visions of ineffable beauty'.  these progressed until about 6:30, where i began a slow descent back to baseline.



i fell asleep for about 15 minutes at +7, which was disorienting to say the least, as i had absolutely no idea where i was when i woke up.  it was actually more like that 15 minutes was just missing from my life.



i had visuals up until about 3 PM, and a pretty heavy buzz untill i fell asleep around +18 (midnight).  I woke up around 2 AM, but i felt more tired then anything else.



this is definately a substance that i would try again.  i attribute the shorter then normal duration to the fact that i have an extremely fast metabolism.  i feel extremely lucky to have had the chance to try this wonderful substance.



the only side effect that i really suffered from was slight vasoconstriction, which was easily solved by walking around, and some slight muscle spasms, which i tend to get on any psychedelic.
