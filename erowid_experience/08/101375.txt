I have my fair amount of sporadic experience with a considerable number of psychedelic and entactogenic chemicals over the last dozen years, and I usually prefer to keep dosage pretty low. When I acquired this new substance called 5-MAPB, the few available sources on the internet told me that a normal dose would be between 50--150 mg (with Wikipedia stating `100--130 mg'). At least to me, that seems FAR too much.



Being eager to try but also a bit cautious, I first decided to put around 30 mg in a capsule. This was ingested at a large party where I was surrounded by an amazing lot of really wonderful people, as well as great music. Two hours before I had ingested 10 mg of metylphenidate, so there was already a slight stimulation present in by body, and beer was drunk throughout the night. And what a night!



Let me put this short: 30 mg of 5-MAPB was, to me, definitely comparable to a `standard pill' of ecstacy (MDMA). I think that 50 mg would be comparable to a strong pill. I might try that, or actually I'm eager to. But ingesting something like 100 mg or more is not something I would try with a new substance like this.



The effects came on gradually within the first hour after ingestion. I would say that the first part of the experience was really identical to MDMA. To me that means a LOT of talking, a LOT of hugging and an extreme taste for cigarettes (although I'm not a habitual smoker). I could switch between very silly and very serious conversations with different people and actually think that a was a good support for a friend who wanted to talk about the problematic behaviour of her boyfriend.



The verbal and tactile sensations together with other people did not feel forced at all, but it was really, really hard to leave that kind of socialization and get to the dancefloor. Around the same time -- approximately three hours after ingestion -- I would say that the effects of 5-MAPB began to change a little bit away from the entactogenic and towards the stimulant side. (That kind of shift in the effects of the drug reminds me a bit of 4-FA).



The stimulant effects made perfect sense on the dancefloor, where I was still being surrounded by wonderful friends and feeling an overflowing love for them all. But I really had to get home, and left the club at around six hours after ingesting the drug. Sitting in the cab, I realized that the effects of the drug were wearing off and that I felt perfectly fine about that. Getting to sleep was not really a problem and after five hours I woke up and began to cook a dinner for my family, which were coming to visit.



The day after I felt mostly fine, but I still thought that 100 mg of 5-HTP could be a good thing to rebuild serotonin reserves. Anyway, for a couple of hours after ingesting that it was like the effects of the drug were echoing: I felt waves of euphoria as well as pretty strong sweating, which made me a bit anxious, but then faded.



To sum up, I am very positive to the potential for using 5-MAPB as an substitute for MDMA -- but don't believe the dosage recommendations that is now circulating. Be safe, start low!
