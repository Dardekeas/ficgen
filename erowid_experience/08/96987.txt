A binge on TNT, cocaine, ecstasy and speed



My friends and I went out 3 nights in a row, and on the last I took about 3 E's (two `Love hearts' followed by 2 halves of McDonalds) we also had `Vick' (which we normally use) and on this occasion `TNT' (some kind of nitrate that you can buy in sex shops).



As I was `coming up' on the final half I took two huge breaths of the TNT. All I can remember is my mind leaving my body and going to another place, feeling so wonderful, blisfull, no feeling of my body, my  thoughts completely clear and a feeling of `freeness', floating freely around bathed in white (but not bright) and a slit of something different ahead, no sound.



The only description I have for this place is heaven. I imagine that this lasted only seconds but it felt like forever. I remember then feeling myself slipping away, I then realised with such clarity that if I didn't come back now I was never going to come back. Suddenly I felt my heart racing my chest heaving and I was back inside my heavy body.



I managed to stagger to a chair and all I could say to my friends was that I'd just been to heaven. I don't know whether it was just a big trip or perhaps if the 3 days of drug use (cocaine, ecstasy and speed) really just came to a head and perhaps for a moment I did die? But it was the most frightening experience I've had using drugs.
