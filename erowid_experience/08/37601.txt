I have tried 2c-i twice now. My first experience with phens was 2c-d and I loved how sharp I felt. I did not expect to trip as hard as I did off of 2c-i. I took about 10mg the first time before I went to the mall with my daughter and my friends to buy costumes. I felt very much in control and I enjoyed being with my daughter and my friends. 



So the next day I went to a day long concert and took about 20 mgs. Once again I felt incredibly happy to be with people, my friends my family. I felt at ease around police officers, even though we got kicked off of the subway and I was barefoot because of giving my sister my shoes. Everything was wonderfully hilarious and oh so typical of my life. My paranoia wasn't that high considering how hard I was tripping. Morphing, feeling like someone is behind me, trails, these were pretty intense. I never really had these type of effects unless I took at least three hits of acid. Oh and I am a very experienced tripper that's why I am so amazed at these effects. 



But what was weird was that I wanted every guy I saw. Not want to have sex with them, but want them to want me. This pertained to both experiences. It has been said that I am very sexy and attractive so I often get alot of stares. This time I would stare back, and stare guys down and they would have to drop down first. I felt very beautiful, sexy and lustful. I was also surprisingly hungry. Starving in fact I spent about \$80 at Red Lobster. The best part was the lack of hangover or `chemical-ly' after effects. After taking LSD I always feel like I got ran over by a train loaded with chemical supplies.



I like 2c-i, even though I didn't have any huge revelations, I have found that I am more comfortable with myself and I feel more joyful and understanding of others. I noticed myself thinking about how other people acted and kind of became an amatuer sociologist. It gave me new perspective on several people. I benefited from it and I will do it again. I can handle trippier stuff because of my schizophrenia. Contrary to popular belief, I find psychedelics beneficial to my disease, but cannabis makes me absolutely out of control. I hate Pot.



Thank you for your time.

Lissi
