I often have troubles falling asleep. My internal clock usually doesn't allow me to fall asleep till at least after midnight. This has always been a problem for me because I am a student. I have to get up at 7:30 every week day and go to school, and then I have to actually stay awake at school. More often then not, I am tired, grouchy, and just plain not feeling fantastic. Oh the pains of sleep depravation.



My Junior year of high school is when my DXM saga begins. I caught a nasty cold and I had no Actifed. I saw the bottle of Nyquil and decided might as well try it. I am a very paranoid person and have constant concerns of being allergic to drugs I am ingesting. Therefor I took probably half the suggested adult dose. I went up to my room and played on my computer as I always do. I soon felt that wonderful feeling I still love to this day. I became very relaxed. I started smiling. My mind was calm (at this time I suffered from a lot of depression and many nights of restlessness due to a reeling mind). Use of Nyquil was in no way to try and escape depression, although it did help by allowing me to get a good nights rest. I became incredibly drowsy and decided to go to bed. That was one of the best sleeps of my life. 



In about a week I worked my way up to a full 30 mg adult dose (and I have never gone over). It was wonderful. I was getting the sleep I needed! It was pleasant to fall asleep! I used to dread the time I had to lay down but now I looked forward to that feeling of stretching out for I could do it completely relaxed and drift off into sleep. I was taking Nyquil every Sunday through Thursday in order to get a good nights sleep for school. Eventually my life got better, I was less depressed, and able to fall asleep at a better time without the need of drugs. 



About 7 months later I have another nasty cold that has dragged on for a few weeks now. I ask my mom if she'd be so kind enough to pick me up a bottle of Nyquil. I was very happy the night I took it because I knew what I was in for. I took the normal adult dose (same is always). I went to my room and drifted into the happy, calm, sleepy, beautiful state that I love. After about a week of nightly use, I noticed something\ldots  Nights in which I indulged in Nyquil, I was more conscious in my dreams. I was lucid dreaming! Something I rarely ever had but always enjoyed. The most notable experience with DXM induced Lucid dreaming was one where I was standing at the end of my driveway. I became concious of the fact that I was dreaming and I could do whatever I wanted. As I realized that, my vision went from a 2-d movie like state to a full on 3-D real life vision. I began to move my arms in a flapping motion and I took off. I began flying. I flew down the street. I hit power lines every now and then, Btu since I controlled the dream, nothing happened, I just kept going. Besides this I had a few other lucid dreams but I didn't remember them as well\ldots 



Unfortunately, while usually have beautiful nights of wonderful sleep, there were a few times I had some rather unpleasant dreams and odd states of awareness. The first was after a night with my best friend sitting in a restraunt for a few hours waiting for a friend to get off work. I had a cold and when I returned home I took a normal dose and went to bed. I woke up at some point in the night, sat up, with my eyes closed (I am not sure if they were or not) and believing I was still in the restraunt talking but that I had become disconnected with reality and my friend was still there talking. (I've had a few times like this after smoking marijuana. I once thought I was still in the car with a friend and talking to him\ldots )



Another more disturbing night was one where I had accidentally taken a bit more than the normal dose. I doubt this caused the problem, it was more likely just my paranoia or whatever. But during the night I awoke in a half awake state to find the room spinning. I was trying to look at the clock but it was blurry. I couldn't focus and the only thought I could make up was that I was drunk off Nyquil for some reason. It seemed perfectly logical at the time and I couldn't wait to tell my friends the next day. When I awoke the next morning, I realized how absurd that was. It wasn't a very unpleasant experience, but odd nonetheless.



Another odd thing I've noticed about Nyquil is that when I stay up longer after the drowsiness has set in, I get the munchies! Just like if I had poked a few onies\ldots  I found that very odd. I have also noticed a few changes in listening. I was able to concentrate on noises I don't usually here. High pitched rings mostly (kinda like if I were stoned). Another unusual thing I've noticed is the odd smell I often get in my nose. Its like a metalic/blood smell. I get this when I take Excedrin and any other pain killers with acetaminophen. A friend of mine has told me he gets the same.



In conclusion, the DXM in Nyquil can be a very pleasant drug. Much nicer than Marijuana because I don't feel stupid just relaxed and happy. One thing one must remember is that one must not take large doses of Nyquil for it contains acetaminophen (the same stuff that's in Excedrin and many other pain killers) this at high doses damages the liver.
