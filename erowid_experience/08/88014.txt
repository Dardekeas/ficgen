Rapid onset with first alert felt at around T+4 or 5 minutes, rapidly elevating in intensity--an overwhelming psychedelic body rush. It is too much for me, I vomit from the intensity, then go lie down. 



I am enveloped by geometric shapes. I am enveloped--but still it is all very subdued in a way, the visuals are not intricate, there are no fractals or complex, impossible structures like with DMT or LSD, although the sheer amount of disturbance to my visual field rivals either; the colors are primary and low in intensity, but everything is increasingly shattered into this fundamental geometry. However, I feel remarkably clear-headed; lucid, even. Mood is neutral. The ego is entirely intact. Fundamentally I feel sober, at least in comparison to the salience of the visuals, the most that I experience is a general drugedness, a stoning sensation, a flitting of the mind between different disconnected trains of thought, but nothing quite out of the ordinary. 



The visual aspect is truly remarkable, however, the colors become more brilliant and start to strobe towards the peak; there are also, unusually for me on a classical psychedelic, notable auditory effects, primarily strobing and rhythmic distortions of sounds present in the ordinary `white noise' of city life going on beyond my walls. Also oddly, I find no enjoyment in music, on the contrary, I find it agitating. I vomit again. 



After the rapid come up, things plateau a bit and I feel more positive. Stoned sensorium recedes, and I start to think more clearly in an operative sense. There is still a good deal of residual tension; body load in the form of clenched jaw and a slight tremulousness, peripheral vasoconstriction. There is a diminished sensitivity to pain. At about an hour after the injection, the visuals die down. Light psychedelia to T+2 hours, and shortly thereafter I return to baseline with the exception of a lingering sensation not unlike haven drunken too much coffee. This persists a few hours. In retrospect, dose could be considered excessive, but experience remembered as rewarding.
