0:00h -- I ingested 90mL of 40\% alcohol for the first time on an empty stomach with some friends.



$\sim$0:05h -- There is a warm feeling in my throat, face, and stomach due to the dilation of capillaries and the irritating effects of the alcohol. There is also a mild sense of well being, nothing major at this point.



$\sim$0:10h -- The effects are apparent now, I am dizzy, red in the face, euphoric, and am noticing a loss of inhibition.



$\sim$0:30h -- We decide to go for a walk, walking is not difficult but my balance is off, my vision has become blurry and it is hard to focus. I notice I am a lot more social than I would be otherwise I am also in a lot less control of my person, I like my inhibitions.



$\sim$1:00h -- The effects are mostly the same at this point, it is pleasurable, there is a pleasant feeling throughout my body but I am not able to let go of the feeling that I am not in control, I suppose if you where to drink enough this feeling would go away and you wouldn't care, but I don't find that to be a desirable effect.



$\sim$2:00h -- I am slowly regaining control, the experience has not been overly intense, but I was able to get a feel for the drug, and can extrapolate what a higher dosage would be like, I don't think I will be trying more anytime soon.



$\sim$4:00h -- Baseline.



Aftereffects -- I feel fine today, there was no hangover but I didn't expect one from the amount I ingested. Alcohol is a very interesting substance, it is a depressant and yet most people don't even consider it to be a drug. Although I found my experience enjoyable I did not like the loss of inhibitions associated with it, anything that can make you lose control like that scares me.
