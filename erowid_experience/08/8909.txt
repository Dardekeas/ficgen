I tripped for 2 days on flowing chi and I can't get enough!!



One year ago, I would not have believed a word of what I am about to say.



One year ago I started doing Yoga because I realized that it could potentiate my trips. 8 months ago, I was very impressed by the how well it did potentiate my trips and with how good it made me feel in general and I decided to try my best to become a master yogi. 2 months ago, I started doing martial arts, Hap Ki Do specifically, because I now believe that Martial Arts should be a part of every Yogi's practice. The two perfectly together each supporting the practice of the other. I chose Hap Ki Do specifically because it was said to be particularly good at activating the Chi.



This last weekend, I first experienced what it means to have your Chi activated and flowing. I am absolutely blown away. It's my new favorite drug. For those of you who don't know what I mean by Chi, Chi or Prana is the vital life force energy as described in various eastern traditions. What does it mean for the Chi to be flowing? Well, that is something that western science has not yet entirely figured out but it something to do with endorphins and other neurotransmitters traveling up the spinal column. Let me explain how I expereinced it.



Friday 3:00 pm - I leave work early. It has been a very long week and it is too nice of a day outside to be stuck inside. I don't have anything to do for the next 2 hours so I spend it wandering in the sun and trying out this new form of walking yoga that I have been trying to figure out. 



Friday 4:00 pm - I am on cloud nine. I am in an absolutely fabulous mood. This is the endophins that the stretching releases. I have gotten this to happen a few times before and I call it the Chi flowing. I am happy to have it back. Everything feels great!



Friday 5:00 pm - Holy Cow! This is definitely the highest it has ever gone. Every part of me feels wonderful and I am totally excited about this walking yoga stuff. This feeling is great! I am really starting to get results with this stuff. At this point I am hungry and I have to meet my wife for dinner.



Friday 10:00 pm - The feeling has died down quite a bit. It went away completely while I was really hungry but came back after I digested some food. I do some of the stretches again while walking around my apartment and the feeling gets stronger very rapidly. I want to see what I can do with it but I am just too tired and I go to sleep.



Saturday 11:00 am - Hap Ki Do class. I'm tired but I make it. Class ends up going over its time till 12:20 instead of 12:00 and I feel utterly exhausted from it. Still, That feeling from last night stays with me and I am able to stay clear through it.



Saturday 1:00 pm - I am home from class, I have showered and I am walking around my apartment doing the walking yoga to keep my muscles loose after all that exertion. I realize that I feel as though I am tripping. That feeling gets stronger as I continue the stretching. 



Saturday 1:30 pm - my wife has a modeling shoot today and we leave for it.



Saturday 2:30 pm - I am wandering through a field following my wife and the photographer and helping by carrying stuff. I am tripping really hard. It feels kind of like acid but not quite and kind of like mdma but not quite and kind of like 2-ct-7 but not quite and kind of like\ldots  well, you get the point. It was amazing. There were visual hallucinations but they felt more like enhancements than distortions. I felt like I could see the wind. My attention would swirl around the fields with it. I was aware of every little click and pop of the insects in the grass and I keep wondering if I am having a lucid dream because real life doesn't feel like this. 



Saturday 6:00 pm - We finally get home. My wife takes a nap. I am still tripping. I feel stiff again. I am worried that I am REALLY going to hurt soon, after a super long class and then tromping around fields for hours. I do the walking yoga again to loosen myself up and I practice some of my kicks and hand techniques. 



Saturday 6:20 pm - I am through the roof! It feels like I just snorted 120 mg of mdma on top of what I was already feeling! I am tripping/rolling really hard now. Every bit of my body feels electrically and powerfully alive. Intense pleasure rush courses through my body. The head trip is like a candyflip. I am too hyper to sit still! I begin to do some sort of weird dance that involves lots of karate chop motions in the air. It feels like the air is a living organism and it is catching my hands and pushing them back at me. I feel that something has manifest in the room and that I am giving it a massage while it wrestles with me. After a while it feels like the air around me is returning the favor and massaging me while I dance! 



Saturday 7:30 pm - my wife wakes up. I start making dinner. Still tripping quite hard.



Saturday 8:30 pm - I'm done with dinner. 



Saturday 9:30 pm - the trip has subsided a good bit. I try doing the walking yoga and some Hap Ki Do kicks as well as a few more traditional yoga stretches. It works. in 10 minutes, I am back to tripping balls. 



Saturday 11:30 pm - I do the walking yoga again for 10 minutes to `bump' again and it works even better than last time. I have spent the last 2 hours being a complete giggling mess with my wife. I can't remember ever having been happier. My wife wants to get drunk so I make us both screwdrivers. The alcohol brings my trip to new heights and doesn't feel at all like being drunk normally does.



Sunday 3:00 am - finally go to sleep. Still feel like I am tripping but am tired. I am asleep in seconds.



Sunday 9:00 am - I am wide awake! I have had totally clear, wildly cool shamanic dreams all night. I still feel like I am tripping but not as hard as last night. I `bump' with some more walking yoga and it works but still doesn't get me as high as yesterday. All the same, I am able to sustain the trip all day, by `bumping' every some often, until I go to bed at midnight. I have a serious case of the giggles all day and keep dancing or sunning because I am too hyper to sit still. Aside from that, the trip doesn't seem to impair me at all. If anything, I feel more focused on whatever it is that I am doing.



Today is Monday and I feel normal again, except that my mood is significantly elevated. I feel like the weekend was more like a week long vacation and I feel totally relaxed by it. This flowing Chi thing has totally blown me away and I just can't stop thinking about it. I have Hap Ki Do class again tonight and I am going to see if I can't get it to flow again. 



So, what happened? Why did Yoga and Hap Ki Do make me trip? The answer to that is very complex and I don't know it. I don't know that anybody does. Did I experience a runners high? Kind of. What I experienced was the next level of it. Cool stuff. I am a fanatic!
