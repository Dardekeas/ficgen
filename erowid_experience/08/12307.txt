I was doing glass about every other weekend and depriving my body of food and rest for that intense high I got on glass, and I'd noticed spacing out the time between `tweaks' made the `trips' better and helped to resist a tolerance to the drug. That night I got a half gram from my hookup to share between two friends, a dude (E) and a chick, his roomie (D). I got to their place with the goods around 10 pm and interrupted them smoking a fat bowl of weed. I, of course, partook in the festivities. Then out came the glass, and we got to snorting. After doing 3 lines each and having a couple beers, we ventured out to a nearby club. We were talking nonstop as usual and having a great time! My heart was pounding out of my chest, and my palms were sweating like mad. It was wonderful. 



E and D had decided to leave their glass at home; I, of course, brought my half of the shit with me to the club so I could do keybumps in the bathroom if I chose to. Well, of course, I chose to. By 2 I'd done all but 2 or 3 lines worth of my share. We'd been drinking beers from the time we'd got there, so I had a pretty good beer buzz. I could somewhat feel the pot, too. I was intoxicated enough at this point to buy two tabs of Ecstacy from a girl I knew in the club. At the moment I was slipping the pills in my pocket, my best friend called my cell phone fucked up like a chicken. He'd went to a local bar and made a bunch of new friends, got totally drunk, and were headed back to his apartment to have a coke party. ALL THE FREE SHIT YOU WANT!!! There were also about 5 strippers (it wasn't a strip club, though) that were coming back from the bar to party. I took one of my tabs and caught a ride to his place.



By the time I arrived, my ecstacy was beginning to kick in and I felt like I was floating. I was starting to sweat profusely as well, and my eyes felt as if they'd pop out of their sockets if someone hit my on the back of the head hard enough! My friend asked if I wanted some coke, and of course, I did! I traded 2 small lines of my stash of glass for a big rock of pure cocaine, which broke up to be over a gram. I put this gram into one fat line across the coffee table and proceeded to try and snort it all. I got about halfway done before I quit. I was speeding so hard at this point that I don't remember much of the next few hours. One of the party attendants told me that I finished the rest of this line about 30 minutes later by sliding off of the couch and crawling to the table. WOW. I took the other tab a little later on, which was stupid.



I was feeling so great from this combination. I remember seeing lots of hallucinations in the ceiling and staring at a TV full of static for about 20 minutes. I was also told that I kept on telling others how fucked up they were, and they'd just laugh, knowing I'd injested enough drugs over the course of the night to kill a small elephant. I remember making trips to the bathroom to do more of the dealer's cocaine. I did about 2 grams over the course of the evening, and still can't believe that they kept on giving me more, seeing that I was sweating sooo bad and it appeared that I was trying to EAT the sides of my mouth I was grinding my jaw so bad! 



The dealer saw around 7 am how bad off I was, so to `help me out', he guided me in the bathroom once again. I thought he was going to give me another line; instead, he instructed me to open wide and dropped some concentrated GHB in my mouth, telling me I needed to `chill'. We then went back into the main room, where we smoked 2 joints, one of which was laced with even more GHB. I hate GHB with a passion, but in this state of mind, had no qualms with it. By the time we'd finished the joints, I wasn't speeding as hard, and was upset about this. This resulted in another trip to my glass hookup, where I bought a quarter more, and smoked it all up with another guy at the party. By this time it was 1 pm Saturday, and I was so spun that I could barely talk. I was coming down off of some drugs, still fucked up on others, talk about confusion!



It took me about 3 days to come off of all of that shit, and it was NOT fun. I was shaking and sweating, and my eyes were like saucers forever. My parents didn't say a word, but I know they could tell I was on something. The night after all of this I went home, smoked a bowl of weed, and took 2 darvocets and 2 valium (Tylenol PMs seem to make my hallucinate even more when I'm throwed on glass, and don't make me sleep!), and drank 2 24 oz. beers. I felt a bit better, but still felt like ass. My advice is NOT to mix so many drugs and NOT to do so much, especially if you have a steady job, go to school, or have someone to hide your drug use from! I felt like the walking dead for a week and looked like it too!
