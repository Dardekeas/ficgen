Male: 25  Weight: $\sim$190 Height: 6'2'' Experienced Cannabis Smoker

Substance: Spice Products, Specifically ``Drill''

Dose: 2 hits (lungs @ ¾ capacity) 5-10 minutes apart every 12 hours



I have a misplaced nerve cluster in my lower back, when it gets aggravated; things like walking become very difficult.  OTC painkillers don't cut into the pain; Codeine handles it but leaves me unable to perform my work or hobbies to my satisfaction.  Cannabis has been a preferred alternative, but the aspect of breaking the law always leaves a somewhat bittersweet taste in my mouth.  I heard of an as of now legal alternative referred to as ``K2,'' ``Spice,'' or ``Herbal Mixes.''  The specific blend I got was called ``Drill,'' I choose it as it was referred to me as a sativa like blend.



Smoking it initially was like a dream come true, I wasn't breaking the law, my back pain was in check, and unlike with cannabis I was completely clear headed although very stoned.  I waited 5-10 minutes between each hit, and held each for only 10 seconds.  Each hit filled my lungs to ¾ capacity; while the taste wasn't pleasurable it wasn't bad.  I would relate the experience to stems.  The high would last 3-4 hours, but my pain would be almost gone for 8 and manageable for 12 hours.



I had no problems with anxiety, as I did not overdo it, but hydrating seemed to be very important to a positive experience.  I had great experiences the first two days with the product, having more energy and being less faded in my day-to-day duties.  My 5th time smoking the herbal blend though things were different.



I used the same dosage as before, I reached similar results although feeling less stoned, my pain was still relieved, so a tolerance was building but I still reached my desired effect.  Then 1½ hours into the experience my stomach felt more upset than just the feeling of something new.  10 minutes later I experienced thick vomit darker in color than it should have been based on my diet it had a strange low carpet texture (the cheap kind that comes in cheap apartments).  This was made worse by the high, as it felt like I vomited this in slow motion; it came out slower than watery vomit, but the process felt like a ten-minute ordeal (in reality under a minute).  Knowing my body and my reactions to things quite well, I can say with confidence that this was a toxic reaction to something in the blend, most likely to do with a build up of JWH-018 and other chemicals in my system.  While I experienced no other adverse reactions that I wasn't expecting from my experience with cannabis, this reaction leads me to believe that ``spice'' may be very harmful to our bodies.  (As a note, my diet has remained the same for quite some time, and no other drugs legal or otherwise were in my system -- this was planned to see the effects of spice on me personally)



This brings me great dismay to say that I will not use this ever again, and I do not recommend its use recreationally.  It is clearly a very potent chemical that has some benefit, but I would place it in the same category as methadone, a substance that's risks outweigh its benefits for most people.  That being said if you do use this product please do not drive as it had a greater affect on my depth perception than I would admit while stoned on it.  Legalizing or making cannabis medically available would cut down on experiences like this and abuse of narcotic drugs (prescribed or not).  I feel cannabis is considered a gateway drug because of its illegality, after breaking the law for long enough with cannabis, one may grow to feel comfortable breaking the law in other ways, if the `I'm doing something bad' thrill was gone, I feel that it's use would drop in people who don't need it.
