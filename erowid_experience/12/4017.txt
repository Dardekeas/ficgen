     It was a Wednesday night in my dorm room at about 7.  I was drinking straight vodka from a bottle that was actually a used water bottle so that it could be snuck into my dorm room without notice.  We finished the bottle in about a half an hour. 



     I didn't even want to drink that night, because I had a test in my 8AM class the next morning.  But I was upset over the troubled relationship that I have with my boyfriend, so I drank more than I should have in a very short period of time.



     I passed out at about 7:30 and didn't wake up until 9:30.  I had an overwholelming urge to throw up.  My boyfriend grabbed the garbage can and so I didn't get the puke all over.  I called one of my friends, but I don't remember what was said.  I had to walk my boyfriend out at 10:30 and I barely made it up to my room.  I stipped off my jeans and passed out in my bed.



     My head felt like an overfilled balloon.  Everything was spinning too quickly for me to keep up and I kept thinking how much I didn't want to get up the next morning.  My arms and legs felt like lead and I kept leaning off of my bed to throw up into my garbage can.  I slept soundly between throwing up though.  I realized this morning that I was throwing up blood.  That must have been alcohol poisoning.



At 12:30, my boyfriend called because he was worried about me.  About the same time, the resident director of our building came to check on me and asked `Do you have alcohol poisoning?'  When I said no, she walked away and that was it.  I laid back down in my bed and passed out till 7AM.



I went to take a shower and I fell down 3 times in the stall because everything was spinning so badly.  I threw up three times after my shower, but I hadn't eaten since lunch (about 11:30) the day before, so I threw up some of the water that I had had to drink that morning.  I made it to my class and looked at the test and noticed that it was spinning really quickly.  I wanted to throw up, but I didn't.  I came home at about 8:30 AM and slept until 12:30.  



Drinking isn't bad, but I really should have paced myself.  I had too much in too short of a time period.  And I hate being sick and throwing up!!
