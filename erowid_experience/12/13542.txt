I had it in the back of my mind to do G with a view to entering a deep salvia state, all the while suspecting it might be a barely worthwhile combo. Perhaps this was a waste of salvia 10x. Or maybe\ldots 



20:20 2.5 grams GHB. Mixed with orange juice in a sealed drinking glass (shaken, not stirred). Down the hatch. It's a piece of piss compared with a blended pedro.



20:25 Very quick come-on. The warmth is starting up. GHB is very cozy, it makes me feel all warm and tingly.



20:30 The GHB is now gently massaging my muscles, particularly my hamstrings. Very nice. Mentally, I'm very happy and unwound.



I was lying on a couch in the living room. This is a fairly large room with two main lights. It is very quiet. No music, no TV, refrigerator is behaving itself (I mean soundwise, not in terms of Requium for a Dream). There is someone else in the apartment but he is fast asleep. He can be my trip sitter (normally a very irresponsible choice, okay ?). 



Fuck it. Let's go.



I'm quite warm and sweaty. Okay, I turned the heat down a little. G is peaking. G has never lost its touch because I take month-long breaks with no hassle. The last G intake before this was 11 days or so. Moderation rocks! I mean this because I have never been able to overdo it with G. To me, binging takes the magic away - like constantly eating pizza until it ceases to be enjoyable. What's the motivation ?



20:40-ish Cool. No fuss. G is at the peak (I think).



100mg of salvia 10x. I actually put a bit more in I think (10mg ?!!). Into a pipe. This is my first salvia pipe intake for quite some time. Two lungfuls. Hot smoke - I'm used to cooling it in a bong. It's not easy but I managed not to waste much smoke. The heat masks that salvia metallic minty taste somewhat. About 15 seconds into the 2nd lungful I feel the salvia coming on. I put down the pipe and lay on the couch - all on autopilot (good lad).



Head gets heavy, the horizontal becomes the vertical, twigs, sticks, braids, leaves, washing waterfalls are vague, physically I feel indifferent which is new (normally the physical fall into the visions is strong and integral). Instead of the last lingering me-thoughts being squashed they evaporate. No onslaught of malapropisms or nonsensical words before the big jump. No green and yellow fields of frogs heads rushing around. No magnificant cylinder of riverlike water rushing around me. No giant unzipping or scissors-like (or fractal-like for that matter) dissection of my perceived body. Simple gravitational effects located in my head. Utterly relaxed - emotionless possibly bemused viewpoint. This is so different. Aurally, there is a soft thick flanged gush like watery background (not quite as prominent as listening into a sea-shell).



I could feel the two drugs working both against and with each other (like some combo intuition - I have had this before with other combos) just before the leap. Both were working some constructive and destructive interference on my whereabouts and I'm now between two horizontal hyperfields with no body and I don't care. I can't really remember what I've done and I feel something new happening. I don't know where I am but I don't think normal `when-where' rules apply or matter.



The fields are complex and rich like clouds but with colour - purples (again, utterly different) and dark reds - and blues. They are interacting with each-other above and below me and I am in the middle. Actually I feel a little to the left of some perceived centre of this universe. To the top right, a feeling of a crowd of entities beckoning me briefly but that goes.



I'm aware of the couch and the room again, but I can induce this new place again by closing my eyes. I have fully recalled what I've done (as expected). It's mostly visual now with eyes closed and I feel a little sweaty and hot. With eyes open there is the usual vague misty noise that salvia brings. In the meditative phase now.



21:00 approx. - I'm lying down in deep relaxation. Another 5 minutes before I get up.



I fell asleep for an hour or so - no feeling of time passing - just sound sleep. When I woke, the G peak was gone. This combo reminded me of taking a hit of salvia on a 5MEO-DIPT or 2c-t-7 peak. There was this amusing blow-up of reality somehow but I was thrown elsewhere for a short time. Very weird. This is not a true salvia trip by any means but it is certainly interesting. Salvia didn't blow the G totally out of the picture - there was a synergy. No after-effects. I haven't tried salvia since - I'm done with it for now. Ditto G.
