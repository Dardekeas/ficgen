I'm a daily coffee user, and have been for years. I roll out of bed, barely conscious, stumble downstairs, and guzzle a cup. Within an instant I turn from night-of-the-living-dead-extra to nine-year-old-on-120mg-of-Adderall. WITHOUT FAIL. I only need a cup or two (small dose considering my size) and it keeps me wide awake all day long. WITHOUT FAIL.



Like a normal human being, I assumed that it was the caffeine in the coffee which kicked my mind into overdrive and kept me so chipper for a day's work. How very wrong I was.



Last weekend, I went to a family reunion, where we woke up markedly earlier than I normally do on both mornings. As usual, I was barely able to open my eyes or walk before I had a cup of coffee. After that, I was wide awake and ready to go waterskiing in a frigid lake at 8:30 (when I usually wake up). Great coffee, huh? Well, I found out when we were leaving that that wasn't no coffee. It was straight up decaf. Decaf. As in de-caffeinated. No caffeine. None. WHAT THE HELL?! Before now I was only a mild believer in the placebo effect or psychological highs, but after an experience like that, I've had an about-face.



If only eating 1cm x 1cm squares of manila paper under the right circumstances could get me high on acid\ldots
