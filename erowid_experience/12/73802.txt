2C-E is known for its intensity, especially when insufflated. One tends to wonder what to do with all of the ENERGY; there have been reports of bodily malaise mainly due to the fact that no position one tends to put oneself in feels at all *comfortable*. 



One night, I insufflated somewhere around 5 milligrams of my current favorite white hallucinogenic powder. I know the warnings against eyeballing the stuff. Number one, I've weighed out this substance more times than I can count, and number two, I'm always extremely cautious with such things. 



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# 



The effects began as they always did, some 30 minutes later, after the `punched in the nose by millions of tiny knives' sensations had left. The point of this report is not to communicate the values of 2C-E, which has been done by much more skilled writers than I, but rather to investigate the synergy between the two substances listed in the title, thus I will refrain from describing any insights or personal revelations experienced.



What I was was typically uncomfortable. I was pacing around, trying to get rid of some of the excess stimulation. Lacking my usual green ally in such situations, I remembered I had a small bag of 20x wild dagga (Leonotis leonuris) extract. I had previously chalked the stuff up to be just another expensive, sub-par legal `high', but thought I would give it a shot.



I smoked a bowl packed with the extract, remembering and not particularly caring for the barbecued-chlorine taste of it (at least that's how I perceived it :D), but was soon rewarded. The excess stimulation of the 2C-E had abated somewhat! In fact, I had to look around me a few times to ensure the dagga extract had not somehow nullified the trip. No problems there, I soon realized. 



I was amazed, however, at how profoundly the dagga extract altered the dimensions of the experience. The usual jangled edge of 2C-E had been replaced by a dreamier quality not unlike a small hit of our green friend, but without the excess mental `oomph' said friend tends to impart.



If you like 2C-E, but find it a little hard to deal with thanks to the feelings of never being able to get comfortable, try some dagga extract along with it.
