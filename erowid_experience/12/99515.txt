In regards to background I've been an IV heroin user of some four years and a methadone user for around two years. I'm familiar with many psychoactives from across most chemical groups.



Having seen how few reports there were regarding ethcathinone, I went ahead and ordered some from a reliable vendor.



The first thing to mention is that people with a greater knowledge of biochemistry than I expected ethcathinone to be more of an agonist at norepinephrine than at dopamine receptor sites, which I feel I can confirm. For me this chemical caused tachycardia, hypertension and peripheral nervous system stimulation long before a `satisfying' dose was reached. Potential users should be aware of this. 



I started by insufflating some 10mg, then proceeded to titrate an IV dose up to around a total of 300mg. This chemical is comparable to amphetamine, with less euphoria and an uncomfortable, ephedrine-like spikiness. While an increase in motivation was noticed, it was somewhat difficult to concentrate on a single task due to remarked akathisia.



In a separate experiment I injected a dose of $>$300mg, during which a resting heart rate of $\sim$120 and hypertension was noted, with an uncomfortable level of stimulation accompanied by diaphoresis and bruxism. Oops.



I imagine any compulsion to redose with this chemical would be moderated by the uncomfortable side effects, but fiends will fiend. I just hope they've got strong hearts.



Expect little sleep, even for a stimulant.



Regards, 



J
