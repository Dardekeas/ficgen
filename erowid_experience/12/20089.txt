I was about 45 days into my cycle and the imitrex and prednisone were not working anymore. The headaches were just too strong.  I had read about this on the net about a week prior and did plenty of research.  My wife had experienced psilocybin in college but I have generally been pretty straight laced.  I had an old roommate that I knew I could ask for some `medication'  and he stated that it was pretty rare for this stuff to come through town, but he had some that he ran through a food processer and put into a large chocolate.



He stated that one whole dose for an experienced user was the whole chocolate, therefore I ate half. My wife had the other half, what the hell it was new year's eve.  I then drank a few beers and to my surprise, no headache!  I experienced a little strangeness and a few laughs and had the best New Year ever, it was also my birthday. I went to sleep expecting to wake in pain having drank the alcohol but I slept like a baby.  It has been almost 48 hours and no sign of headache. I hope this worked.  I'm episodic (about every 12 months).  I think I am really going to research how to get the liberty cap that everyone speaks of because I really don't know the details of what my friend gave me.
