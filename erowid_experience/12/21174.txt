It all started yesterday at noon, my friend D came over with a 4 grams of weed and 8 50mg Ultram pills.D told me that Ultrams were cool while smoking weed. I could have never dreamed of the effects of the two combined.



(times are approx. and were written while on the drugs)



So D and I sat down at about 12:15 and took 2 50mg Ultram pills each with a glass of water.



T+0:05-We sat down and smoked 2 grams of weed.



T+0:15-We're really high right now and decide to take 2 more Ultram pills each.



T+0:20-D and I smoked the rest of the cannabis.



T+0:45-I start to feel a sense of wellbeing, start feeling extremely relaxed and higher than usual.



T+0:55-Start to itch all over my body and I notice my senses are heightened(everything is vivid and food has a weird texture to it).



T+1:20-Still high, itching, feeling good but starting to get tired.



T+1:40-I finally get up to go to the bathroom, balance is weird, it's hard to stand or move.



T+1:45-Back from the bathroom, time is slower or so it seems.



T+2:10-Talking seems to be distorted somehow.



T+2:35-My friend D has to leaves and I begin to feel slightly paranoid.



T+2:55-All paranoia is subsiding and I start to feel really really good, a feeling closer to ecstasy but a weaker effect and without the hallucinations.



T+3:20-My friend D comes back and with 2 more Ultram so I take 1 with a glass of water.



T+3:50-Me and D are still high of the Ultrams and the cannabis.



T+4:35-Im starting to feel confused and nervous.



T+5:00-Still high and becoming worried.



T+5:15-Im just laying here wondering when I'm going to come down.



T+5:45-D left and had to go home for the night.



T+5:55-My skin feels smooth and slick.



T+6:05-I'm sweating puddles.



T+7:30-Im still higher than my life and I decide to lay down and go to sleep.



T+7:40-About to fall asleep.



I woke up today around 10:30 and I feel great and refreshed. It was a good experience overall. I don't know how or why it gave me those feeling but I hope I get the same exact effects from them again.
