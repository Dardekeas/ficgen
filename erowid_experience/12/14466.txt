Hello my name is John but for certain reasons I would like to be called `Kinderfeld'. This experience hopefully will be one of many `Trip Reports' of mine published on this site. About ten minutes ago I downed 4x5mg Percocets on an empty stomach with a small chocolate milk shake. 



Before I get into the effects of this wonderful painkiller I would like to tell you a little about myself. I am a nineteen year old guy from Seattle, Washington. There is not alot of stuff to do in Seattle mostly because it rains 24-7. So in my free time I have decided to experiment with every type of drug I could get my hands on and submit my experiences to this awesome site, so hopefully this won't be the only trip report you read of mine. The drugs I have experimented with so far have been the following: Alcohol, Marijuana, Mushrooms (P. Cubensis), MDMA (ecstasy), MDA, Amphetamines (Ritalin and Adderall), LSD, Morphine, Opium, Cocaine, Nitrous Oxide, Hydrocodone (Vicodin), Codeine, Hydromorphone, Poppy Tea, Nutmeg, Diazepam (Valium), DXM, Ketamine, Peyote, methadone, mescaline and now oxycodone. Out of all the drugs I have taken I would have to say that Cocaine was my favorite as well as the most addictive, I am strong enough to have only done it twice.



ON TO THE EXPERIENCE:

While I was typing the intro to my little `Percocet Pleasure' essay here I started to feel the effects of the 20mg of oxycodone that I had taken just ten minutes before. Friday I had gotten my wisdom teeth surgically removed so my mindset for the day is rather rough with my mouth being sore and all. I have taken alot of narcotic analgesics but never oxy untill now.

Right now about 30 minutes after I have taken the oxy I feel content and relaxed. More detached from my surroundings. I am still swimming in a warm fuzzy euphoria, since a mild euphoric rush like taking a small amount of a 10mg tablet of morphine on an empty stomach. To me nothing can beat the old familiar opiate buzz. Not even sex although I do think sex is over rated by far, yeah sure it's fun and feels awesome but it is nothing like what certain drugs can offer you. So far Oxy is great and as long as you don't go overboard on the dosage you are still able to carry out every day activites.

It is now about an hour after I have taken the oxy, and I am still higher than a kite. I'm probably about to start coming down but I don't know yet. I got off the computer for 30 minutes to enjoy this wonderful `Government-Special'. It seems like gov. only lets you enjoy yourself if you are in pain. Anyways it is now an hour and 30 minutes after the initial dose and I am starting to gradually come down. I am beginning to think about how nice it would be to take some more oxy but I going to hold off on that. I am again reminded of how easily one can get addicted to such a substance, which is why I am not so much in a hurry to experiment with Heroin.



It's now 2 hours and 15 minutes since I have taken the 20mg of oxycodone and almost all of the effects have worn off leaving with me with a pleasant relaxing feeling. At no time during this experience have I felt sick to my stomach, mostly because I have plenty of experience with opiates so don't be fooled by this trip report, there are bad sides to this drug. The first opiate I had tried was 3 Vicodin 5mg tabs and I puked my guts out for 6 straight hours. So if you are going to try oxycodone approach it with caution. I would recommend starting off with small doses to make sure that you are not allergic to it and to see how you and your stomach reacts and what not.



In conclusion, Oxycodone has been good to me, and I still have 11 more little white percs to look forward to as well. If you like opiates I would suggest you try this if you can get your hands on it, it's no different than hydrocodone and codeine it's a little stronger buts thats all. There is a difference between drug users and abusers. Don't let yourself fall and become another statistic. Be strong and treat every drug with respect.



 -Kinderfeld
