I have a rare case of panic disorder in which my panic attacks segue into convulsions. I have previously been medicated with Ativan, but my physician and I decided to try something different and we both agreed on Klonopin. I have extensive experience with several different benzodiazepines but this is my first with Klonopin.



Klonopin is as described a potent benzodiazepine. I took my first 0.5mg tab about 3 hours ago and within 20 minutes began to feel the effects. The effects are comparable to Valium. There is a bit of slowed coordination and slowing of though processes. However, for what I am taking it for, it is a miracle drug. I have feel no anxiety whatsoever right now, and am carefree about everything. 



I just spend an hour with a friend and had a very mellow experience conversing with her. She knew I was taking a new medication so she wasn't weirded out any by my delayed reactions, etc. due to Klonopin's neurodepressant activity. During the first hour of onset, I felt extremely chilled out and just wanted to sit around and listen to music. The sedated feeling has lessened a bit since, but the relaxed mellow aura is as persistent as ever. I'm still sitting here listening to John Frusciante, who by the way if you don't know who he is, he is the guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and he does a lot of his own solo work. He's amazing, and writes some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Definitely music to enhance my mood and enjoy this experience.



Unfortunately, I will be taking Klonopin regularly (daily) for my panic symptoms and convulsions so it's noticeable effects will begin to deteriorate with long-term use. But for now, I'll enjoy it for what it is. :)
