My new drug is a relatively unheard of nutritional supplement called phenibut. I wouldn't necessarily call it a drug but more of a neurotransmitter with similar effects to GABA. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Inhibitory doesn't mean ineffective, far from it, phenibut is a VERY powerful substance. I first read about phenibut online when I was researching nutritional supplements to help ease my mental anguish. You see I was once addicted to various drugs including Oxycontin and the demon crack cocaine. I was able to quit Oxycontin, albeit suffering severe withdrawal symptoms several times, but crack was another story. As many people know cocaine becomes a mental addiction that is much harder to quit than opiates, in my opinion. The ritual of cooking up my own crack was almost as fun as smoking that first rock. I was only able to stop using when got a DUI, lost my job, spent all my money, pawned my stuff and even stole from my family. I used to have bad paranoia, lock myself in my room after smoking and this didn't go away after I stopped. I had nightmares about people crawling through my window, completely irrational, and dreams about smoking crack and waking to find I was covered in sweat on the floor of my room. Needless to say I was a mess. 

	

After trying various herbal supplements including, Rhodeola roesea, St. John's Wort and other mildly effective and overpriced vitamins and herbs I found phenibut. Labeled as a nootropic and anxiolytic, this sounded like good stuff. I found a vendor online who sold phenibut in bulk as a powder. I ordered 30g and waited impatiently for UPS to deliver my product. When it finally arrived I was so overcome with anticipation and longing I immediately mixed up a heaping spoonful in some Gatorade and chugged it down. YUCK! This stuff is gross, it tasted sweet yet bitter and slightly salty.  I waited for the effect to take hold, it took about 1 1/2 hours for the first sensation. I would describe it as similar to Valium or alcohol. Being an addict by nature I always want more so I drank another bitter orange flavored phenibut concoction. Another half hour passed and UGGGHHH I felt dizzy and nauseous, my head was in a cloud my body tingling with waves of energy. I got sleepy and went to bed hoping to wake refreshed. No such luck, I woke up and was even more fucked up than when I went to sleep. Plus my throat was so dry that my uvula had swollen up and was like a big balloon in the back of my throat.  I drank copious amounts of water and the effects waned throughout the day. As the severe feeling diminished I discovered that I enjoyed the milder effects much more than the severe. This was good, I had found a pleasurable substance that was by its very nature self limiting.

	

While experimenting with various dosages over the span of a week I read as much as I could about phenibut and analogous substances. To my surprise I read that baclofen, a very similar substance, was being tested on cocaine addicts and helped them with their cravings. I thought about this and I realized that I had not thought about cocaine even once the entire week, and even after I ran out of my supply of phenibut the fortuitous benefit stayed with me. I don't know why this worked but I believe phenibut somehow down regulated the overactive region of my brain that craved cocaine.

	

Phenibut has benefits and drawbacks. It can make me a blathering fool by lowering inhibition. This can be a good thing if you are shy, but could also make an outgoing person wildly over exuberant. If I combine phenibut with alcohol the effects are additive as alcohol works on similar neurotransmitters namely GABA. I once took methadone and drank at the same time with phenibut and was totally gone. Now I take phenibut only when I go out with friends and want to be more social. I have also given it to some friends who complained of the overwhelming initial effects. Some came back for more and others stayed away, it just depends on personal preference. 



All in all phenibut is a different drug with unusual effects and possible addiction cessation properties. Use with caution and awareness of the benefits and side effects.
