My name is mike, I've had allot of expiriences with mind altering substances thus including, cannabis,ecstacy,heroin,various pharmaceutical's (xanex,adderal, oxys\ldots etc), lsd, coke, and the list goes on but my memory is shot.



I get a text from my dealer telling me he's got some kitty (ketamine) for 40\$ a half gram. So being as adventures as I am and with just one day before the new years I decided to buy it, along with 3 hits of really good LSD. I've done K before this time but it was in a extreamly small dose and I felt the minor effects of it and I liked it.



So I called up my friend  T and told him I had all this shit and he was down to get fucked up with me that night. So we get to T's dads house at first I honestly was not sure on how much to pour out so I poured out a little, let T snort his then I did mine, but then for some reason I just dumped the whole bag out and just said fuck it. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. after me and T snorted the entire bag of K we both dropped one hit of LSD. A this point all I remember was me sitting on the couch next to T mumbling words and yelling WHERE THE FUCK AM I!!



Now from what I remember I had the most tunnel vision I ever expirenced in my life I can relate it to moxy if u guys know what that is..( foxy moxy anyone??..heh) but anyways time felt like it last for hours and hours on end I was laying on the couch yelling random incoherent things at some of my friends, one of my best buddy's girlfriends was there baby sitting us and I was asking her to fuck like a million times, at this point my friend big T came down  to see what the fuck was going on. I was surrounded by faces, they looked stretched out out, and extreamly bubbly, everything in my world was bubbly, I had absolutely no control of my body and apparently T's father came down and I started swinging my fists at him and I was calling one of my best friends rude names, like fuck you your a dick go die in hell\ldots shit like that. I was such a fucking wreck I had to have my friends pull my pants up because they came down some how\ldots it was the most embarrassing thing I ever experienced 



I was fucked up to the maximum, my original plan was to do all of this K on new years but that would've been bad..so good thing I got it over with\ldots how did I get home??



T, the one I did this K with was driving my car while M, my friends girl was driving behind us to make sure were safe\ldots when sitting in the car.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  I felt like I was in a fucking space ship..EVERYTHING was strecthed out swirling in circles.. I could see every fucking detail of the entire world  my hands looked like mickey mouse and I thought I was going to die by the end of this night because it would never end.



We got to my apartment complex, my friend M helped me walk up to my door and opened it for me and I got to my house..no one was home so I went straight to bed.. I was so fucked up I just could not believe it.



This was the most intense ketamine trip I've ever expirenced\ldots I almost lost all of my friends, punched my friends dad in the face while his 8 year old brother was there and all in all I just lost sense of everything I ever knew\ldots 



I dont think I'm going to do Ketamine for a very long time after that day\ldots .today is new years eve. 2012 is coming very shortly and I'm gonna go get drunk.. HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE\ldots just be safe and know your dose\ldotsbecause I was fucking stupid.
