This was several years ago, but I thought I'd post my experiences up as a warning to others.



I got some Halcyon in Mexico, as the pharmacist told me it was just like Valium, only better.  Being young and dumb, I took him at his word and did not do any research on them before ingesting.  When I got home, I took a few (I can't recall the exact dosage), along with some methamphetamines (another consequence of being young and dumb).  It seemed to be just like another benzo, and I went to bed as usual.  



The next morning, however, my girlfriend informed me that I'd attacked her and tried to strangle her, while speaking in tounges.  Even years later, I do not have even fragmentary images of the incident, but judging by her bruises her account of what happened was correct.



All in all, I'd never go anywhere near this stuff again, and it's not worth the risk.  Stay away!
