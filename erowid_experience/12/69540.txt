This experience lasted about a month long. I acquired the pills (a lot of them) from a friend who had found them. I wasn't sure what they were so I looked them up and it didn't sound too bad so I figured what the hell? I took two. Felt great! Took some more. Felt better! Woke up the next morning and didn't remember a thing. I did the same thing for about a month every night. Then I started to mix alcohol with them. By the time I was doing that I'm pretty sure I was addicted.



One night I took about six. I'm not all that sure what the dosage of them was. They looked exactly like the ones in the pictures in this vault. Anyway I took about six and polished off about half a bottle of tequila. I played guitar for a while then BAM! That's all I remember. I woke up the next morning and there was a knife next to my bed and my arms and body were bloody as hell and cut to shit. I apparently tried to kill my self that night. I swear I can't remember a thing.



Apparently I called my ex-girl friend to tell her I loved her and the next day when I told her about the experience she said I called her at three in the morning crying and carrying on about this and that and I freaked the shit out of her. I don't remember doing that. I flushed the remainder of the pills down the toilet that day and went though what I considered mild withdrawals that night at work. I was sweaty, irritable, nauseous, and such. Kind of like if I am just about to get the flu or something.
