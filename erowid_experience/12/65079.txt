I'm not a serious recreational user, but having some chronic pain issues, I tend to experiment a little to find ways to alleviate the pain (aside from standard RX's from doctors).



Anyway, the other day, I decided to give DXM a shot, due mainly to some interesting comments/articles I've read in regards to it's abilities as an analgesic.



I ended up taking 220 mg (small dose - no other active ingredients) for my 96kg weight, which lasted about 8 hours (tapered off greatly after 5). I was pleasantly surprised as to what I felt throughout the entire time - that is, I felt pretty euphoric, had dancing feet, and the pain I usually feel abated greatly. Also, I decided to skip-out on a couple of doses of my usual oxycontin during this test. I had no withdrawal symptoms at all, and generally felt confident, and energetic during those particular hours. Afterwards, there was no serious crash, and I just simply slipped back into normal life.



I'm not planning on jumping much past that dosage. I've had fun/bad trips a long time ago, and am in no hurry to go traveling in any serious manner right now, but I can see myself taking these `therapeutic' doses occasionally to see if it'll assist with the pain.
