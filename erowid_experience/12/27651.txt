Mindset: Everything generally ok in my life. Not under any stress or anything.



Setting: My basement in front of my computer is where I started the experience.



3:40 pm: Took 4 tablets of 50mg Gravol, total of 200mg. Ate them with water.



3:55 pm: Sitting here on computer, feeling a little different already, but not buzzed. Just like something is changing inside me. Gonna go walk upstairs.



3:59 pm: While upstairs, I thought fuck it and took 2 more tablets. Now there are no more gravols in my house. Hopefully I experience something at least minimal and hopefully positive.



4:10 pm: Getting hungry, so going upstairs to find some grub.



4:25 pm: Just finished eating ice cream, turned on my cd player, listening to hip hop. At this point, no effects are felt. Starting to lose faith in this ``drug''. 



4:55 pm: Started to feel `different' about 5-10 mins ago while making myself some grilled-cheese sandwiches. 



4:58 pm: Having trouble focusing eyes on some things, including my computer monitor.



5:00 pm: Getting up from my computer chair to turn the music down a bit, I felt very heavy and weird.



5:30 pm: My friend came over. At this point I was feeling very strange. Very light and weightless. I noticed my volume of my voice was a bit lower than usual, but nobody noticed. Was still able to talk to family and my friend without them wondering what was wrong. One of the stranger sensations I have is that my eyes feel sleepy and that I just wanted to sit down or lay down, but I wasn't tired, just my eyes wanted to close all the time.



5:45 pm: My friend and I left my house to go for a ride in his car. As we were driving it was snowing harder and harder (I live in the north, today was the first snowstorm and it's only mid-October), but with no wind. The snowflakes falling felt like we were traveling through hyperspace, especially when my friend was going over 100 km/h. Very trippy ride, very fun. 



Later on that night we smoked some cannabis, but it wasn't until I started noticing the effects were going away(around 7:00 pm). But as soon as I smoked a few hits of the weed pipe, I was getting some of the effects of the gravol coming back. The rest of the night I was mostly just high on the cannabis, but after smoking lots of it, my eyes felt tired, and sometimes they would close shut without me noticing, but I wasn't asleep, I was still aware of my friend talking to me, and I was `dreaming' being in his car like as if I had never closed my eyes. Everything was so real and I was able to reply to him. I was still aware of everything around me, but sometimes I would have weird random thoughts while he was talking and it would confuse me and I would reply to him, but it wouldn't make sense to him. I then realized that I was having closed-eye `dream' or visuals that was making me think that we were talking about something else, that doesn't make sense. Its hard to explain really, but I smoke cannabis at least once a day, and it's the first time this happened to me, so I know it was just the gravol making me imagine those thoughts (even though it started to wear off), but smoking cannabis just makes the gravol `buzz' come back in a different strange way.



In conclusion, this whole gravol experience wasn't a bad one, nor a good one. I kinda enjoyed the weightless buzz it gave me, but didn't really experience any hallucinations (that I remember). I would try this again but next time on a higher dose (maybe 8 -- 10 50mg tablets instead of just 6 tablets).
