Bought dried kratom Premium cut dried leaf from a well-reputed internet supplier.



I brewed the tea late in the evening, last eaten some 2 or 3 hours earlier. I took 3 teaspoonfuls of the herb, poured 2,5 dcl of cold water over it, brought the tea to boil and then brewed on moderate temperature, in a closed kettle, for 15 mins. Strained the (very dark) liquid through a metal (was that the problem?) strainer, then poured another dcl of water over the leaves and left this second batch to simmer for 15 mins more. Then I strained it, mixed the two batches and reduced the tea in the kettle to some 2 dcl or less of dark infusion. I added Earl Grey black tea and a tablespoonful of white sugar. The resulting mixture tasted just fine, quite heavy, but spicy and seemed a bit sirupy. 



I drank it slowly in a darkened room and waited, sitting and lying. Good music was on. No effects came, not even after 2 hours. Then I decided to go to sleep - I had some difficulty falling asleep, in fact. I had perhaps a slight feeling of time warp, as though much more time had passed than the clock showed, but this could be easily attributed to the ungodly hour (4:30 in the morning, dawn approaching). Having fallen asleep, I slept ok, dreamt nothing of importance and woke up to feel as normal as one can after going to bed at the hour.



Conclusion: I'll increase the dose by at least 100\% and see what happens. Either it will work, or another expensive herb (after kanna last week) has failed me. I might have underestimated the neutralising potential of my endocrine or nervous systems\ldots  Or I might well be forced to conclude that legal `drugs' are legal for a reason.
