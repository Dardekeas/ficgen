My experience with psychoactives is a pretty mild one.  Three or four shroom trips, lots, and i mean lots, of `dank,' a lil X,  blow, and K (small amount).  But i never got mysef to use `cid.' Anyways, being in public safety, i can no longer afford to use illegal substances due to drug testing and that i am gettin older.  The only drug i really miss is MJ.  She was always good to me. 



I came across two plants that really grabbed my attention one being Salvia D. and the other Wild Dagga.  After researching them on the net, i ordered about 5 grams of Wild Dagga flowers, for they are to be a lot more potent and better tasting than the plant matter.  



My package arrived today in the mail and i met the postman at the mailboxes.  I was kinda like a kid on christmas in the way that i was excited to see if the reports were true.  I went back into my apartment and decided that i would wait until tonight, b/c i like being high at night, it is much more fun to me. I went to see my girlfriend before she went to work and on  the way back to my place i decided to pack a little bowl, just to see if there were any effects.  I lit it up and the stuff burnt up really fast, only got like two good hits.  After a minute or so i got a little lightheaded, like MJ, and turned on some Zepplin.  ONLY two hits and i have a small buzz.  I rode on back to my place and watched some tv.
