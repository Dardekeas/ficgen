I was disturbed to see poor reports on this drug.  If you haven't had a good time with kava, chances are, you are either buying local herb shop root (which is not at all potent) or some other commercially grown crap.



The method you prepare it is 2nd most important.  Contrary to popular belief, kavalactones are not damaged unless the temp reaches 140 F. The far best method is to boil about 5-6 TBS of powdered root into two cups of water and bring it to a boil.  Remove from heat and add 1-2 cups of ice to cool it down.  Strain with panty hose leg.  I know this method works best because if you try to take the strained solids from here on, it wont even make a decent drink (the color is almost clear).  Drink as much as it takes to feel a good effect.



I personally purchased what is considered the strongest variety of Kava - `Mahakea'.  `Moi' is also considered strong.  I ordered mine from Hawaii directly from a grower for \$40 per pound.  That seems expensive, but it is so strong.  It is strong enough that when the boiling mixture is cooling down, I dipped my finger, touched it to my toungue, and within 5 seconds, that portion of my toungue was really numb (like with coke).  After the mixture is strained, refridgerate it!



Remember that if you are ordering kava, it is best to get Hawaiian kava and not Fijin, Poynesian, Micronesian\ldots .   Hawaiian is considered by many to be the best, as kavalactone tests reveal.



I drink about 50ml of this mixture and feel it instantly.  I have now broken an addiction to xanax and ambien, as the calming effects are quite strong with kava, and after about four hours, I feel tired enough to get to sleep (more so than the `forcing effect' with ambien).  I swear by this stuff.
