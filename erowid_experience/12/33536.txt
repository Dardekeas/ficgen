After taking a few milligrams of 2ce mixed with water, I was pretty disappointed with the results - only mild visual distortions on the carpet. I then snorted some which was a bad idea as it stung badly. The effect this had was euphoria and a few more visual distortions of my surroundings. I felt like an interesting chemical was knocking on the door and not been allowed in, so I experimented further. I scooped out what must have been at least 30mg of 2ce powder, put it in water, and drank the lot.



After 20 minutes, I noticed a rainbow/neon like effect appearing in some areas of my vision - I was struck by how similar this seemed to acid. The visual distortions on the carpet (always the first and last thing I see when I'm tripping) grew stronger, with amazingly intricate patterns. The walls and bed seem to breath. Lines on my bed sheet flow in waves. Orbital sounds amazing. Despite all these effects I still feel like I'm missing something. I feel euphoric, but isolated maybe. I might of liked someone to share the experience with, but everyone is asleep.



2ce is a very powerful chemical, at least as powerful as LSD, mescaline or psilocybin. It has a slightly bitter/synthetic taste. There was no hangover, just a buzz that lasted into the next day. It was very hard to get to sleep when tripping on this, and I had a constant feeling like I needed a piss, even though my bladder was pretty much empty. There was no nausea at all. It would be a good idea to have someone there to speak to for some of the trip, and maybe someone tripping with you. I think I would enjoy this drug to go clubbing on.
