I've been interested, as of late, in this `legal high' thing, as in, getting high off of different herbs in a legal and safe manner. So, I read online and found an article about how a man made a tea from catnip. I decided that, after ordering a two dollar bag (one ounce) from an online herbal store, I would put it to good use. Smoking a joint from it didn't do all that much, even when I mixed tobacco with it.



I boiled a pot of water, put catnip in a coffee filter, tied the bag with a thin rubber band so that none of the catnip herb would fall out, and I gently slid the bag into the boiling water to let it `cook'.



Time: 06:26 - I just started boiling the water and making the catnip tea. I'm sure my father will be interested in what I'm doing. Telling him that it is simply `herbal tea made from catnip' (which is the truth, actually) would suffice. He might even try some, who knows? I also got some sugar ready, because I'm guessing this stuff doesn't already come sweetened. :)



Time: 06:29 - I took the water off to stop boiling and put the bag in. The water is quickly turning a distinct brownish red color, something common in tea. I'm surprised, really, to see such a thing. I didn't know catnip would make hot water turn brownish red. I guess I was wrong. I smushed the bag with a spoon against the side of the pot every once and a while to `squish' out some of the soaked up juices, which quickly made the water turn an even darker shade. I'm going to leave the bag in there for a few minutes to make sure that plenty of the filtered herb liquid comes out into the water.



Time: 06:36 - I took the bag out and put it in the refridgerator, in case perchance I might want to reuse the bag in a new pot of tea. I poured about half of the small pot into a coffee mug, and here it sits with a small amount of sugar added next to my mouse pad. I'm letting it cool off a bit before I attempt to digest it. The fluid, upon further inspection, seems to be a light brown color, or a caramel color. It looks a bit like apple cider, and smells like normal tea.



Time: 06:42 - I'm slowly drinking the catnip, where it is still extremely hot. The taste isn't amazing, probably because I only put about two and a half teaspoons of sugar in the pot. But, it's pretty easy to get down. I reccomend trying to down a whole cup, once it gets cooled off where you can do that without scorching yourself. When the rest of the pot cools off and I finish this cup, I'm going to try that.



Time: 06:54 - I got tired of getting my tongue burned, so I put it in the freezer for a few minutes while I played Xbox. I came back, and the tea was nice and warm. I downed the whole cup in a little under five seconds. I immediately noticed a relaxation of my muscles and a warmth in my body as it went down. Even now as I type this, my fingers don't really feel like typing, more like just laying down on the keys lazily. I went to go play some more San Andreas and test out what the effects are like.



Time: 07:14 - Nothing major happened with the cup of catnip tea. I did notice my vision, for some reason or the other, becoming sharper. When I was playing the game, it was like my eye-to-screen accuracy suddenly boosted up. The effects didn't last that long, though.



Conclusion: Catnip didn't get me high, but it's definitely a nice drink to relax to. I suggest after a hard days work, you come home, pop in your Office Space DVD, get out some of that catnip tea, and have a cup or two. I propose that catip tea is an interesting alternative to normal tea, and it tends to be cheaper, as you can reuse the backs about three times over.
