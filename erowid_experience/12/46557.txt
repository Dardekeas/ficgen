It's supposed to mix well with alcohol so I soaked about 30 grams [a little more than an ounce] in a bottle of wine [white\ldots next time maybe red] for about a week. Based on the research that I had done I thought this would be about 1.5 `servings' so I expected very noticable effects. the wine was now quite bitter and I decided to get something to eat to mask the taste. After double-checking to make sure it wasn't a MAO inhibitor or something like that I picked cheese. The cheese was a great idea and with its help I drank about half of the bottle of wine while I watched the Tarantino episode of CSI. there was a mild `good' sensation that seemed to come and go, but nothing too noteworthy. 



I didn't feel anything from the alcohol at this point so I decided to keep drinking. I strained out the flower bits and I don't know if that lessened the experience, but there's no way I could have eaten them\ldots the wine was difficult enough to drink. by the end of 2 hours I had finished the entire bottle of wine and that was it. I felt slightly `different' and not one tiny bit drunk\ldots not even tipsy. I even interacted with others once I had completely finished the wine and nobody questioned my sobriety. the `different' was more pleasant than not though and I'm definitely interested in trying again\ldots but since the experiment cost me about \$25 I don't think it will be anytime soon.
