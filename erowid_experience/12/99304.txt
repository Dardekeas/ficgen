For several years now I have browsed trip reports and have felt indebted to the legions of anonymous psychonauts that have generously donated their time to help reduce the harm of misinformed drug-users. I have always wanted to give back to this community in some way, though I never felt like I had anything particularly valuable to add. I used the classics such as LSD and mushrooms. Everyone knows what these do and there are miles and miles of trip accounts to give people a very fair idea of what to expect when embarking upon those pharmacological highways. It wasn't until more recently, however, that I felt that I had something truly valuable to contribute to this amazing collective corpus of knowledge, especially considering that my own experience was spurred on by the pleasant reports of this particular substance that I had read online, and because my experience was rather contrary to those. It is a much less commonly used substance with very few reports under its belt. It is 25b-NBOMe. 



At the time of this trip I had previously experienced LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, ayahuasca, 2C-E, MDMA, methylone, \emph{Salvia divinorum}, and other more casual substances such as cannabis, Kava Kava, Valium, and alcohol. I would consider myself a fairly experienced user of psychedelics, though I still feel some apprehension when approaching the use of any such substance. Judging from the words of Terence McKenna, who said that dread is the most commonly occurring emotion prior to his trips, I doubt I will ever fully get over this emotion and, frankly, I don't think it's a bad thing. It means that I am aware of the possible dangers of any such experience, and that I don't take of it lightly. Aside from festivals, and a one-off ayahuasca ceremony, I have only ever tripped alone. This experience was no exception. 



I procured two tabs of 25b-NBOMe (as well as a couple of tabs of I and C) from a highly regarded vendor of gray-market research chemicals for plant fertilization and not for human consumption. Of course. According to reports of the vendor on the Internet, I have no reason to believe that this substance was anything other than advertised. Reports online regarded the substance as something similar to a combination of LSD and MDMA, bliss, and a perfect psychedelic with no negative side effects whatsoever and minimal body-load. Such reports remind me that everyone is different, and that the only true way to discover the properties of a substance is to try it for yourself. 



25b-NBOMe is undoubtedly a very powerful chemical. This trip would rate an easy +++ on the Shulgin scale and was much more intensely psychedelic than any experience I've had on LSD, ayahuasca, or just about anything. It was visually extremely impressive, and I would have been quite taken by the substance if it was not for a very toxic and uncomfortable bodyload that I found nearly unbearable. My limbs quaked, and I felt weak and unhealthy, as if my body was suddenly starved of all electrolytes. This physical side effect persisted long after the psychoactive components had worn off. This toxic physical component is what hurt my experience the most and has made me very reluctant to revisit this chemical.



I took a single tab (which contained 1mg of 25b-NBOMe,) which I held between my lower lip and gums for about 40 minutes. I was sitting on top of a secluded hillside overlooking a beautiful valley on an absolutely idyllic spring day. After about an hour since the tab came into my mouth, I noticed a sort of detached and dreamlike feeling and the mountains around me began to morph and move together. A short while later the trees around me had eyes and mouths and were smiling, and I was definitely beginning to feel the effects of the chemical. I closed my eyes and melted into a labyrinth of red morphing patterns and faces that had filled my vision. This is also when I began to feel my body grow weaker and I decided to lie down for a while. I attempted to dance to some music I was listening to but found that extremely difficult. Even when merely standing, my legs were shaking.



The come on was actually extremely gentle, as was the come-off. Similar to LSD, my brain shifts swiftly in and out of the psychedelic dimension with no real awkwardness or discomfort. I think a big difference between LSD and this substance, however, is that I felt very much withdrawn into my own alien world, whereas with LSD I feel very open and enamored with the world around me. There was a notable blurring of my vision, whereas LSD tends to greatly sharpen it.



After a while I realized that I was beginning to trip pretty damn hard and that I should probably get back to my house (this being off of a public hiking trail in walking distance of my home) and so I decided to start to walk back. Walking back through the forest, I was now in a completely alien landscape. Trees and bushes were merged into new organic lifeforms that Hollywood's best only wish they could invent. Fractal rainbow patterns that exploded into faces were beginning to immerge from the ground as I walked. 



I was tripping balls. 



With sunglasses, the world dissolved into a dark nightscape that was neon-lined with the inverted shadows of the forest trees. Eventually I managed to get back to my home, and I pushed through my gate, which was now dissolving into that same neon-night spectrum. I pushed through the door and washed my hands, which seemed to be undulating with some kind of living oil that was fragmenting around my wrists. 



After drinking some water, I finally plopped onto my bed where I stayed, a bit overwhelmed and totally incapacitated, for probably about an hour. Honestly, I'm not really sure how long I was there for. The posters around me were fully animated and the ceiling morphed with subtle rainbows. I've heard this substance described as ``mellow'' which is true to the extent that it seemed to drain away a lot of my physical energy and was best suited for lying down. I can't imagine taking this stuff at a rave. 



After what was I guess about 5 hours after I had taken the tab, the peak experience began to fade and I spent my time playing guitar and drawing. Though the overtly visual effects went away, I was still very much in a psychedelic headspace for some 6 or 7 more hours, which were accompanied by the negative physical aspects that I mentioned beforehand. Playing guitar was an amazing experience and I'm very satisfied with the drawings I created. Later in the evening, I became rather anxious and negative thought patterns overtook me, perhaps a result of coming off of the substance. 



13 hours after I took the 25b, I couldn't sleep and my body still ached, and so I took a few Valium to fall asleep. I slept fine, and the next day I had no side-effects whatsoever. In fact, despite feeling pretty bad towards the end of the trip, and dealing with a lot of more negative things, I have felt absolutely fantastic for the past few days since the experience. It seemed to have ended a streak of depression that I was falling into over the past couple of weeks. My dreams have also been markedly more vivid.



Overall, I would not take 25b or any other NBOMe again, simply because the physical component is too unpleasant to bear. I don't want to feel poisoned when I take a psychedelic, which is essentially how I felt on the NBOMe. There is no doubt, however, that it is a very powerful psychedelic and I don't regret having the experience. This is not true for the authors of other reports I've read, but I think that a great many who dabble in psychedelics don't have full-on psychedelic experiences. They may take some weak acid or a small dose of mushrooms and get a ``funny feeling'' but they are far outside of the mental dissolve and subconscious-illumination of chemicals such as these. 



This is a chemical for experienced psychonauts that want to dig down the rabbit hole a little bit deeper and don't mind dealing with some potentially negative (though not permanent) physical side effects.
