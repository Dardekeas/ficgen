I discovered the effects of Tussin accidently after a bronchial infection early winter 2000. I started taking 2 `shots' per night because I realized it made me more relaxed while at the same time seemed to give me more energy. I also felt my thinking was clearer than it had been in years. The only negative side effects I noticed were insomnia and occasional bouts of nausea and vomiting. I also noticed a decrease in my appetite (which I didn't consider a bad thing!) During the 8 months I took Tussin, I rediscovered my faith in traditional Christianity. I mistakenly believed the Tussin was responsible for this new peace of mind. I was wrong. 



Because of other health problems (and because I found myself unable to go more than 2-3  nights without taking Tussin), I went to my family doctor, `confessed' my Tussin abuse, and was diagnosed as suffering from depression and generalized anxiety disorder. My primary care physician prescribed Paxil which was to relieve the anxiety for which I was `self-medicating' with the Tussin. After 6 weeks of discontinuing my Tussin use and taking 20-30 mg. of the prescribed Paxil, I found myself in a hospital emergency room, disoriented, confused and convinced I had gone through the ultimate salvation/conversion experience. 



Suddenly all my past fears and hopes were resurfacing, seemingly unbidden. I was convinced I was going to see dead friends and family around every corner. I distrusted everyone around me and felt there were `signs' from God everywhere I looked. I was admitted to the psychiatric ward of the hospital for 4 days. During this time I was taken off the Paxil and needed to be given a mild sedative in order to sleep. My confusion lessened during those 4 days, but I still was unsure of what was happening to me.



This was over a week ago. Although I'm still sorting out what happened to me, I am convinced the Tussin played a major role. How much of a role remains to be seen and whether I will ever feel `normal' again is also a question yet to be answered. I wrote this experience report simply because I want others to be aware that Tussin is far from a benign recreational drug. Wishing you more natural ways of finding Peace!!
