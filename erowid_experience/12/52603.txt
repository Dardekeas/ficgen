Two days ago low on Marijuana and not in a very good mood (I was seriously un-approachable) I decided to try something different.  Months ago I was prescribed to Amitriptyline, for depression, and still had a bottle left. I took 2 of my 10 mg Amitriptylines, and 4 regular OTC Benadryl's.

 

If I had anything important to take care of, or have to drive, I would not take either of these medications, It is simply to hard to pay attention.  I took these at around 5pm, and after 30 minutes I found myself extremely delirious and in a very relaxed, `chilled', state of mind.  I was very happy, and stayed awake for two hours playing Halo and having a great trip.  



Afterwards I collapsed on my bed and preceded to have one of the best night sleeps I had ever had.  I slept from around 7:30pm to around 10am the next day.  I felt very refreshed and my mind was clear of everything. I drank a cup of coffee and went to school in a very good mood.
