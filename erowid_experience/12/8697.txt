9:30

I take 3 .5mg generic Alprazolam tablets to combat the high dose panic I usually get with cannabis.  I have not eaten in 6 hours to clear my stomach for maximum effect.



10:00

The Xanax is slowly overtaking my body with a gentle softness.  I feel very relaxed, but this is not at all like alcohol.  My friend D recently bought a four hose hookah that we planned to use tonight.  We also have a large amount of cannabis, 1/4 o of powerful stuff.  We pack a huge bowl, and begin smoking.  And smoking.  And smoking.  The only reason we stopped is because we became too uncoordinated to light the bowl.



10:30

The smoking session ends and I feel like I'm starting to nod off, my body is VERY loose (which is good, because earlier today I had a terrible back ache) and my mind is exploding with free association.  I start to see the deeper meaning in less signifigant things.  It reminded me of a part from the book Siddhartha, in which the main character is being told by his friend how the river knows all, how it can teach him infinate wisdom.  

I am now too stoned to understand (or even care about) the menial banter that spews from my tv and decide to engage in the only thing that seems real now: music.  I normally prefer indie and classic rock, but during my chemical excursions, trance is the only way to go.  I layed in bed, but my physical surroundings now meant nothing.  My vision meant nothing, all stimulation was audible and I was playing a very strange movie in my head.  Very beautiful and relaxing.



The rest of the night was just lying in bed relaxing, until I woke up.  I feel a little groggy and mentally impaired, but nothing that doesn't go away in a day or two.



Xanax and cannabis are, in my opinion, inseperable.  Especially for someone who is prone to anxiety, it really keeps you on a good vibe.
