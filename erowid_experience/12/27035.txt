Let me start this out by saying I am NOT a hardcore drug user and do not want to be, I've smoked my fair share of pot and I drink, thats about it.



I got interested in trying Poppies after an experience with Codiene got me a little bit interested in opiates. 



I bought a bundle of 25 dried poppy pods on a friday, they showed up on a monday, I tried 3 attempts with them to get effects. The pods where ground up very fine in a coffee grinder so as to get the most out of them.





Attempt 1: took 3 pods and boiled in water (incorrectly I later found out) for a while and drank the substance, it did nothing\ldots  except I DID notice one thing\ldots  it gave me horrible gas\ldots  almost `chest pain' level gas.



Attempt 2: 8 pods boiled in water (again incorrectly and this I would pay for later on) and drank, again I felt very gas filled and disgusting, this time so strong I vomited (once)\ldots  



----------------------------------------------------------



now at this stage I was ignorant that the boiling of the pods destroys the alkaloids within the poppies, so I thought `ahh the worst it does is makes ya sick' and I thought `I'll up the dosage and get really lit' \ldots  I had no idea what was in store for me on a 12 pod dose.



-------------------------------------------------------------



I took aprox 12 poppies worth of the material and decided I would set it in hot water over night and drink the cold tea the next day. 



The next day passed and at about 7:00 in the evening I took tea out and stranged the material through cheese cloth and into a container\ldots   



I downed the muddy brown brew in about a half hour\ldots  I didnt feel much effects except the gas so I figured it was a dud just like before\ldots and that I was an idiot for even trying this\ldots  boy was I mistaken.



The sick feeling steadily increased and I felt worse and worse, I was sitting in a chair day dreaming and feeling a little spaced out when the gas really hit me and I had to go vomit\ldots  well when I got up from the chair I knew I was high because I couldnt even move correctly and the pain in my stomach felt detached from my body\ldots  it was extremely weird\ldots  I just barfed all over the place and crawled to my room\ldots  I remember laying on the floor feeling so incredibly wasted I couldnt even move\ldots and the pain actually felt good in some sadistic way\ldots it was like the last shred of feeling left in my body\ldots  I thought I was going to die and I was so high it was scary (in retrospect it is scary, at the time I was too screwed up to know better)\ldots I mean I cannot express this enough that I felt so `out of it' and dreamy\ldots 



I fell into a deep, dream-filled sleep and had incredible dreams\ldots  I woke up about an hour later and vomited again\ldots  this continued all night long and lasted into the next day\ldots  



I was constipated for about 4 days\ldots  it was horrible\ldots  absolutely horrible..



all in all? I say screw poppy tea\ldots  it was the worst drug or alcohol related expierence of my life.. I thought I was gonna die and I found out later on I *COULD HAVE* died, easily\ldots 12 strong poppies had me pukeing and high for over 6 hours and sick for 8 or 9\ldots  thats a wicked experience\ldots  I'm afraid to ever go near any opiate again and I'm glad of this fear\ldots
