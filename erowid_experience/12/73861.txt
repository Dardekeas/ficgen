 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\#  



I did about a box of ccc every two months or so. Never really experienced a bad time with them either. I had a day off from work and 8 30mg pills left and decided that today would be a good day to trip. I have a very fast metabolism, I'm 125 with very little body fat, so 8 or 9 pills was usually enough for me. 



00:00 - I take 7 of them. I take a short drive to a buddy's place.



01:15 -- I'm feeling the pills kicking in, I take the 8th one.



01:50 - I end up with a bowl of weed to myself somehow so I start rippin in. Smoked almost the whole thing and just sat back for a few mins. It didnt take long to start feeling like something is wrong but I brushed it off. I'm walking around and talking trying to get my mind of it but I start to feel light headed so I pop-a-squat and just close my eyes. 



02:10 - This is when I really started to trip out. I was having some very intense but pleasurable closed eye visuals when something catches my attention and I stood up. My heart is fucking POUNDING. I'm getting really nervous and cold. I cant hear my voice as well. I never in my life thought my heart could beat so fast. I'm trying to drink as much water as possible. I tried lying down but it didnt calm may heart beat down. When I get up I realize my vision is getting dark, pixalated and then tunnel vision. I started having hallucinations of me dying. I'm screaming for my friend telling him how scared I am. I try to hold a conversation with him to calm down but I'm fading in and out.



03:15 - Somehow I survived an hour of hell. I'm starting to get a grip on reality but I am still very uncomfortable. My friend and I begun playing some games to help my mind get back.



04:45 -- I'm now stable and convinced I will never do ccc again.



Its been 18 months now and I still get very intense flashbacks of that horrible day. I feel like my friend was the only reason I was able to make it through that whole nightmare.
