Last night me and a few friends decided to head into NYC and go to a club.  On our way there, I purchased some beer for a friend and I, and in return he gave me 2 (two) 200mg pills of Provigil in response to my complaint because we has no amphetamines left.  He said to take the pills and that they'll keep me going through the night.



I had a lot of money to burn, so after we got into the club, I immediately started drinking beer after beer and a few mixed drinks.  After a while I was feel rather good.  The Provigil kept the sleepiness of alcohol away and helped me move and produced clearer more concise thoughts.  This was definetely a lot of fun, and I continued to dance and talk and the likes.



For the next few hours, I drank steadily and got to the point where I could no longer fully stay awake, so I found 2 more Provigil and a half hour later, I was right back up to where I was, but with an increased sense of euphoria.  I was extremely upbeat, happy and the music sounded good, so it all created an extremely nice atmosphere.



Around came 4 or 5am and I decided to head home.  I tried rather hard to sleep and when I got back up and went to work, I still felt it with me.  It was really sort of reassuring because otherwise I have a hard time staying active.
