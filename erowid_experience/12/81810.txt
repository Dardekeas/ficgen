Pre-loaded with a few hits of Cannabis w/ flakes of 15x on top of each hit to help tackle any `reverse tolerance'. The last bowl smoked was good plain leaf with a scoop of 15x on top, dark room, laying down alone, eyes closed. Got up and wrote most of this right after it happened. This was by far the `realest' \& most visual experience I've had with \emph{Salvia divinorum} so far. I am still in disbelief \& was not expecting this strong of an experience



I exhaled and as I was laying there, I suddenly saw lots of Beings/Entities that looked like people walking away from me in formation with their arms out in a pushing motion, 2 distinct long curved chains/groups of people on both sides of me facing away from me \& they curved out away from me, all working in unison. Try to imagine 2 groups of people pushing open a giant swinging gate that opens from the middle - they'd be pushing with their arms out while walking at an angle\ldots it was that type of motion. I was observing this from a raised angle looking down at them at about a 45 degree angle, like I was hovering above \& behind them. I remember thinking they all seemed the same, looked the same/possibly dressed the same, slightly cartoon-ish/animated yet real Human feel to them, I remember saying to myself `what are they all doing?', trying to figure out what their deal was. They did not seem to notice me or if they did they never turned back to look at me, I saw them vividly for at least 20 seconds, possibly a little bit longer. When I say `vividly' I mean it literally looked \emph{real}. I remember that as I was watching them all perform this task that I slowly started to go from thinking `I'm laying down in a room' to really feeling like I was going somewhere else and no longer in that room or in a body but it was a smooth transition, probably the smoothest one I've had so far with Salvia.



I am still in shock/awe of what happened next \& can't believe this even happened. I realized they were all making something turn/spin as they were pushing/performing this task and just when I was starting to make sense of what was happening these 2 chains of people literally turned into 2 huge cog wheels/gears with interlocking teeth (not Human teeth, that is the term used for mechanical gears) that were spinning against each other, the gear teeth were interlocking with each other as they spun/turned and there were rows of them and along each one of the `teeth' in the wheels/gears that stuck out there was a different `scene' taking place inside each one, I distinctly remember getting the impression each one was a different Reality or some different version of Life and I remember saying to myself `oh my god look at all of them\ldots wtf, there's people inside these things!' It was extremely bizarre \& confusing. Like some kind of machine farm of Life. I saw a few rows/stacks of them out in the distance and also below me as well. All these wheels/gears turning like stacks of them all turning horizontally. These things were all the same size. I remember distinctly seeing a few rows below me off to my right and could see at least 3 or 4 rows out into the distance and it was dark off into the distance, pitch black. I got the sense there were many more I couldn't see as they faded into the distance and also I got the sense there were more rows above me as well, although I didn't look up directly.



My view of what I was seeing was as if I had popped out of the side of one of these turning gears (the tooth which contains our Reality/Existence) and could see them turning/spinning horizontally underneath me \& around me. I was seeing these scenes/realities on the teeth of the wheel/gear that was turning opposite of me and on a few of them off in the distance \& to my right side. As they were spinning/turning around the teeth got very close to me and that's when I distinctly saw things happening in each one. I could have sworn that when these teeth got real close to me each one had a Being/Entity/Person on the edges of each tooth or something like that, 2 of them per notch, as if they were overlooking each `gear tooth'. It is hard to put into words exactly what it was, but that's the closest I can do. It was such an odd feeling and I could have sworn one of them tried to grab at me and pull me into one of the other gear teeth as it spun by, but I'm not sure if that's what was actually happening. Again, it was extremely weird \& confusing. These wheels/gears were \emph{massive} and I felt tiny next to them, like I was just some floating form of Consciousness that was right outside the wheel/gear that contained us. It's like I popped out of it for a few minutes and was just hanging out there, observing what was going on \& I could sense it turning to my left \& slightly underneath me. These things were so massive that I couldn't even see the center of these cog wheels/gears, so I have no idea what, if anything, is happening there. I could only see along the outer edges of these things. I know this sounds like crazy talk but I swear every word of this is true, it felt so \emph{real}. I don't know how else to word this feeling I had, except saying it felt amazing!



Our Reality/Existence/Life is taking place inside of some kind of turning Cog Wheel/Gear and there are many of them with many different Realities along/inside each `gear tooth' of the Wheel/Gear. These things turn/spin and interlock with each other. There isn't just one Wheel, there are many! Here is a picture I found online and this is almost exactly like what was happening, but this is not the angle I was seeing them from, I was seeing them turn/spin horizontally, not up \& down, \& it felt like I was hovering above \& very near the one that contains us, but the action/motion is exactly the same as what these things were doing. Again, the things I saw were all the same size/mass:

I remember thinking I was going to have to apologize to the other people in the house I had just left \& maybe the whole world because I might have possibly ruined things by what I had done, like maybe everything was being crushed in these spinning gears or at the very least I messed up our Reality/Existence by smoking this, I screwed our `tooth' up. That was an odd feeling actually. I got some type of thought along the lines of `I hope they're ok, hope they make it through this'. It felt like I was going to have to explain what just happened to them because it felt so damn real, like when it was all over they were going to say `what the hell did you just do?!?' as if the world was going to demand an explanation. I also remember getting some kind of thought like `These people have no idea what is even happening to them, they have no idea they are inside these things!' I was more worried about the rest of `Reality' than myself. I really did feel like I was somewhere else. Something about it felt right/familiar but at the same time I also got the feeling I wasn't supposed to be seeing what I was seeing. I could draw it if I knew how to draw/paint, but I'm horrible at Art. They weren't even `visuals', I was actually seeing it \& felt I was actually at wherever I was at. I was seeing something else, not just `visions'\ldots it was no different than if I had my eyes open watching something, that real \& fluid \& detailed. I really didn't think it was going to be that strong \& was not expecting that to happen! Only held it in for about 15 seconds. I couldn't help but laugh to myself a few times after it was over. I don't know which one was `realer', this Reality we are in now or the place I was at watching all these cog wheels/gears turn. Not only was that the best experience I've had with \emph{Salvia} so far, it was the best experience I've ever had in my entire Life. There is also this feeling of a need to return to that place. This Reality/Life seems rather boring at the moment. I'm convinced that the full potential of this plant is only reached when extracts are smoked. Quidding plain leaf is just `fun \& games' compared to smoking high doses of Salvinorin A.



I will never be able to look at a pair of cog wheels/gears the same again.
