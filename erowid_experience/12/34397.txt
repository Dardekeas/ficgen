I measured out fifty-milligrams of 2C-D.  It was a fluffy, gleaming-white powder and I dissolved that into ten-milliliters of distilled, sterile water.  This was held in a glass vial for ease of use and measurement.  The 2C-D almost immediately went into solution and required no heat and just a little shaking for the crystals to dissolve.



Monday, May 3, 2004



5:53 PM:  Measuring with a syringe, I draw up one-milliliter of the solution, containing five-milligrams of 2C-D.  This experiment is to better understand and experience this molecule's alleged ``smart-drug properties'' for a future study I plan on conducting.  It has a slightly bitter flavor, but it isn't bad at all.



6:19 PM:  Definitely feeling an alert.  Difficult to define.  I feel a kind of warmth in the chest, and the knowledge that I have taken something.  Not really stimulating, just warm.



6:40 PM:  At this point, the effects seem to be fully developed.  I guess I am at a plus/minus on the ``Shulgin scale.''  There is warmth in the chest and a slight increased interest in activities I am doing.  But there is nothing that I feel to really consider this state one of \emph{cognitive-enhancement}.  I felt more from piracetam when I took that, and find d,l-amphetamine to be a much better study aid then this.  There are no amphetamine-like feelings with five-milligrams of 2C-D.



7:03 PM:  Not much more than before.  It's been well over an hour.  From my prior experience with 2C-D, I know this is as far as it is going to go.  I would describe this as a ``buzz'' really more than anything else.  I am perhaps at a mild plus-one.



7:19 PM:  I just read an essay given to me by an on-line acquaintance.  I found the 2C-D \emph{seemed} to increase my interest in reading the work, but I can not honestly say it wasn't also just a placebo result.  There is no truly discernible activity beyond the ``phenethylamine body-buzz'' that is occurring.  I do not notice any real \emph{cognitive-enhancement} or ``smart-drug properties.''



7:34 PM: Much of the same.  If there is any cognitive-enhancement, it is simply because I can feel a small amount of a psychedelic in my body and thus I am more alert.  But there are no real psychedelic effects at this level.  All I feel is just the warm feeling in the chest, and perhaps now some mild stimulation.  But not like d,l-amphetamine stimulation.  I have no desire to work, or do anything productive.  I just feel a little ``uppity'' as if I've had too much coffee.



8:07 PM: Again, much of the same.  A nice warm body-buzz, but none of the cognitive-enhancement said to be the hallmark of lower 2C-D dosages.  But there is also some slight stimulation now and a tiny bit of nausea.  But it is more annoying that anything.  And the stimulation is not like d,l-amphetamine produces.  I do not feel productive or have any desire to work.  It just feels like the comedown of a psychedelic.  I am hoping pot helps this.  This experiment ``finished'' and I shall smoke some cannabis to relax.



8:15 PM: Just took a balloon of nitrous oxide and the experience was short, but \underline{very} intense.  I know the 2C-D enhanced the effects of the gas, however as the nitrous wore off I did not notice anymore residual effects from the 2C-D.  The cannabis did not increase any effects either.  Five-milligrams of 2C-D  is definitely a sub-threshold psychedelic dosage, but I bet it would increase the effects and add a little ``flavor'' at this level if mixed with another psychedelic.



9:00 PM: I don't really feel anything left at all anymore, and I am going to go out and visit with friends.



Conclusion:



The main reason I did this experiment was that I want to conduct a study testing 2C-D against a few other molecules in a controlled environment to see if 2C-D shows any unique cognitive-enhancing properties.  I felt that I needed to know what a ``smart drug'' level was like personally to conduct this study.  I also needed to experience this molecule at the five-milligram level because I must now find the equipotent dosages of the other psychedelic phenethylamines I plan to use in my experiment for verifying if 2C-D does show cognitive-enhancing properties.



I personally did not find that 2C-D was a ``smart-drug'' at five-milligrams.  But I also did not take any cognitive tests before and during the experiment to really see by scientifically acceptable standards.  I simply went by what I felt.  I think d,l-amphetamine is a much better tool for concentration because it actually works for me at a five-milligram dosage in keeping me focused, and there is no nausea from d,l-amphetamine.  Maybe the ``smart drug'' properties are different in nature than what d,l-amphetamine does, but I felt nothing either way that could qualify as cognitive-enhancement



I also feel if I had increased the dosage of 2C-D to ten-milligrams, psychedelic effects would begin.  And smaller dosages would probably have less ``smart drug'' properties (if any) than what I took.  So, I am not personally comfortable with calling 2C-D a ``smart-drug,'' but I will wait and see what the results are when I test it with other people.
