I recently decided to import adrafinil into Canada after reading many articles online about its kin modafinil, which is sadly controlled here. I had mostly read about this class of drugs being used to enhance academic performance (studying, speaking, writing, et cetera).



I am a soon to be graduate student, so while I do not technically have any tasks to perform of an academic nature, I am enough of a geek that I enjoy my studies, and often haunt the university library. On this particular day I decided to head to the library and review some literature about Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta. Before leaving my apartment, I swallowed two tablets of Olmifon (adrafinil) at 300mg each, along with my daily multivitamin, with some water. I then went out into the rainy afternoon, arriving at the mostly deserted library. I found my usual table by the philosophy stacks and a few of the books I wanted, and set to reading.



Around half an hour into reading (so about an hour since I ingested the pills) I began to notice myself yawning. However I knew I was not tired, and mentally I felt quite awake. Soon after this I began to have some tension in my jaw, and became somewhat thirsty. Though these few side effects were unpleasant, the focus I possessed at this point was wonderful. I usually skip around essays, and have many disorganized thoughts cropping up due to associations with the subject matter. This behaviour did not seem to be a problem now, as I found it much easier than usual to switch between my internal commentary on what I was reading and the actual stream of understanding the text itself. 



Upon finishing a few essays, however, I found myself restless. I got up and went to a water fountain, then sat down again and began to read. I found I wished to write on my laptop, and this thought repeated until I finally got up, checked out the books, and headed for home.



On the walk home I lit a cigarette, but quickly decided it tasted awful, which is not something that usually happens. I doubt it had anything to do with the adrafinil, but I suppose it could. Upon returning home I chatted with my roommate about my experience, ate part of a meal, and then did get down to writing. 



Throughout the experience, which I suppose was 4 or 5 hours, I did feel I was `unnaturally' awake, though it did not feel as tense as caffeine can for me. There seemed to be a bit of pressure behind my eyes, some jaw tension, and  I did continue to yawn (seeking oxygen?). At the five hour mark or so I went for a walk with a friend and smoked a cigarette. Soon after, I did not feel `up' at all, and was quite grumpy, though this undoubtedly had as much to do with our conversation as the cigarette. Still, it did seem the cigarette `ended' what I had thought of as the adrafinil feeling.



Now I am around five hours removed from that cigarette. I do not know if adrafinil will be of actual use for studying or writing, but I think next time I will try just one pill.
