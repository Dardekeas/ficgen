I finally did MDMA. I've had my doubts and temptations to try MDMA for many years. Pretty much ever sense I heard about it and decided that it was morally ok for me to use illegal substances. It was a wonderful experience.



I dropped my pill at 9:30 PM on Wednesday evening. I had a normal amount of food that day, my homework was finished, and I was ready. I cleaned up my room, brushed my teeth, and took my contacts out just like I was going to bed. I had myself prepared for almost anything. Not to mention I was relaxed. My mind felt content. Perhaps it was a little nervous, but no big deal.



During the first half hour, or so, I was talking to my little brother. We were talking about school, what things we liked, etc. There was no arguing, fighting, or the usual sibling crap we go through. I was completely relaxed.



Then about another half an hour later I just started feeling a little funny. I was even more relaxed, and my mind was completely clear of worries and fears. I just felt happy. I wasn't a big rush either. I could still tell that my mind and body were connected. I was still myself. That part I was a little surprised about. I wasn't sure how well my soul would be connect to me, like some other drugs. It was great.



I was watching Better Living Through Circuity, a documentary on electronic dance music and rave culture. The music was terrific, but I am glad to say that it's just as good, or even better, when I'm straight. I can recall tears just flowing down my cheeks. I wasn't sad, I was happy. I just felt so good. My body felt alive.



Things were going well. I wasn't getting intense rushs and I wasn't freaking out. Last year around this time I had a little accident with over the counter sleeping pills, and I flipped. I had to drink charcoal, go to the ER, and spend a day at an institute. This is part of the reason why I wanted to try MDMA. I wanted to prove to myself that I can take certain drugs on my own and be ok. I know I shouldn't be alone, but for once I felt the need to. I definitely achieved my goal.



Later on, I danced and flowed. My arms felt like water. Free flowing and cool. I was in heaven. At that time I noticed my jaw clenching and chattering. I sucked on a lollipop and that helped it a lot. I was sure to drink water. I wasn't dancing that much, but my mouth was getting dry. What's a little water anyway? Those were the only bad side effects during the experience.



The peak was incredible. I'm not exactly sure how far along I was when I peaked. Tears were flowing again, and I just sat in my bed. I was getting little fuzzy buzzes over my body. I just felt like I could fly. I kept thinking about how wonderful I was feeling. It was intense, but in a very pleasant way.



I think it was 4:30 AM when I attempted to settle down a little. I tried to sleep some, but I had music on. I needed to let my arms flow. I think I got to sleep around 5:30. Mind you, I get up for school at 6:00 AM. I slept for that half an hour, but when I got up for school I still had a fair amount of energy. I rushed to the store before school to get a lunch and some caffiene just in case I needed it.



I was relaxed and content with myself all day at school. I didn't need to take my Zoloft either. I was starting to feel pretty tired. I made it through the day. Work was kind of brutal though. I was very, very tired. I made it though. Sleep was still a litle uncomfortable.



The day after is when I really started to feel the negative side effects. My mouth is still incredibly dry, my stomach is a little queasy, my arms hurt (that's from dancing though), and I'm tired. It's kind of like having a minor cold. I'm sure it'll clear up within a few days.



But yes, it was so worth it. It's not something I would want to do every weekend. Once a month is plenty for me. It's a nice thing to use when I want to relax. It's fun. I don't really suggest doing it during the school week. I kind of got my schedule a little messed up. Rolling by yourself is ok, but I'm sure with close friends would be better. Be prepared for NASTY cotton mouth. It's gross.



Oh yeah, and eat an orange. It's the best thing I ever tasted. Plus, the vitamin C doesn't hurt either.
