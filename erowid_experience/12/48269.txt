Let me start off by saying that before my first LSD trip, I had taken psylicobin mushrooms roughly ten times, so I am farmiliar with psychedelia.  I am a senior in high school and was on thanksgiving break, and had a strange hunch that I would be having a psychedelic experience that week. My friend and I made a last minute decision to go to a concert in the city, and we hung out in the front of the venue to finish drinking the last of the alcohol we brought with.  There were people asking if we wanted to buy hemp accesories since they didn't have enough money for tickets.  I told them I didn't want the hemp, but gave them five dollars as a friendly gesture so they could have a good night.  The guy thanked me, and decided to offer me some LSD for \$5 a hit.  I took him up on the offer and bought two since it was such a low price.  The blotter had no lines on it, so he estimated the size of two hits by ripping off pieces (it could have actually been around 3-4 hits since he had no scissors).  I ate a small section of the paper and my friend and I walked into the show. 



I was expecting the drug to hit me fast and hard, but I couldn't see or feel anything for at least 45 minutes.  About a month earlier I ingested mushrooms and felt no effects, so I figured it was either fake acid or I needed to eat more.  I pulled out the remaining section and ate it.  The concert was Phil Lesh and Friends at the Chicago Theater, and the first thing I noticed was that the fancy chandeleers had moss hanging from them.  I looked at the stage, and behind the band looked like a long vortex of small multi colored specks of light in front of a black background.  Since the venue was dark and the music was loud, I focused mainly on the vibrations around me and had a great time doing so.



My friend wasn't on any drug except alcohol, and he constantly made trips to the bar to get drinks. I kept looking at the band members faces and seeing jerry garcia appear, and also thought that the lead singer looked like jesus.  I felt that jesus was approving of the experience since everyone was dancing harmoniously, acting kind, and sharing their positive energy.  My friend was dancing very strangely, and I couldn't tell if it was the acid, if he was drunk, or if he was just a horrible dancer.



When the show ended, I felt that the experience was beautiful and I felt the spirit of the grateful dead as well as the 1960s LSD phenomenon.  The lights went on, and my friend and I walked out.  I started talking to him, and he was acting very strangely.  We walked down the stairs and suddenly he fell backwards and slid the whole way down.  I realized that he was very intoxicated and that even though I was on an acid trip, I had to take control and lead the way home.



I kept getting the feeling that he knew everyone there was having crazy experiences on drugs, and since he is scared to do them, he got extremely drunk to fit in with the crowd.  That really upset me since he promised he would watch out for me on my trip, but then blew me off and got too drunk.  We started walking, and I realized how much alcohol limits communication.  He kept telling me to get a cab, but a strange voice in my head told me to walk the whole way.



On the walk, the side walk had multi colored patterns that glimmered from the snow and water on the ground.  Christmas lights were everywhere, and I felt the spirit of the holidays in the city.  It was a beautiful experience, and I thought of myself as a spiritual leader, guiding my friend through life as I guided him to the train station.  He kept asking advice on what to do, and strangers kept asking me directions to different parts of the city.  I thought that leading people in different directions was a powerful and wonderful gift.



When we got onto the train, there were strong patterns everywhere, and all I wanted to do was stare at them.  My drunk friend was ruining the experience by slurring out things like `What am I going to tell my parents?' and `How are we getting home?'  He repeated the same thing over and over again and I became so frustrated that I yelled at him and told him not to talk to me. There were much older, almost homeless people sitting a few seats behind us that were also at the concert.  They were definitly on acid as well, and started making fun of my friend and his attitude.  They also started making fun of me because I had the `I'm not friends w/ this kid' attitude, since I wasn't paying any attention to his drunken banter.  It made me uncomfortable, but I stayed focused on the patterns everywhere.  I realized that alcohol is such a primative substance, and felt that drunk people have limited communication skills.  



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



We walked to my car parked outside the train station in my town, and there was frozen ice all over the wind shield.  I got out and wiped it all off with my sleeve, and started driving towards my friends house that was about three blocks away.  I started driving and couldn't focus my eyes past the ice on the wind sheild and couldnt focus on the road ahead.  I stopped the car and forced my friend to help me get every last ice speck off.  He was being difficult and half assed his job, which made me furious.  He wasn't taking the LSD seriously and figured I could get through it.  I dropped him off and zoned out all the hallucinations to get to my house.



I walked upstairs and told my mom I was home, but had a very hard time getting words out.  I ran into my room and realized that the trip was still going strong about five hours later.  I turned on some music and put the visualizer on the media player.  I tried to find something interesting to watch on tv, but everything seemed like complete garbage.  The only thing I could stand to have on were useless infomercials.  I sat down and began to look around.  The folds in my jeans turned into mouths and noses, which resembled the talking hat in the Harry Potter movies that has a face from the wrinkles in the hat.  Everything had colorful patterns and was constantly moving around.  



The visualizer on the computer was beautiful, and I felt the amazing vibrations of music.  When gazing into the swirls of colors on the screen, I came to a great spiritual conclusion.  I realized that our higher power is all of the energy in the universe, and this god-like energy created humans so that we could feel good sensations. Good sensations are paired with means of survival; for example, we feel amazing when we are sexually aroused, which leads to creation of more humans.  We can taste delicious things to absorb energy in our bodies to keep ourselves alive.  I saw visions in my head of how humans got to where we are today, by creating societies and religions to make us as comfortable as possible in our lives.  This is the god-like energy's way of feeling happy itself, since we all are a part of this universal energy.



I thought of how evolution is simply a way for this energy to feel more and more good sensations, and that the creation of drugs by humans was a magical way to feel even more bliss.  I thought of Albert Hoffman creating LSD, and how that was a monumental moment for humans to use our brains to mix all of the senses into a beautiful euphoric explosion.  I thought of how humans evolve, and that if we give our brain acid, it will be expanded, and therefore lead humans into a further evolution since our brain is experiencing such amazing sensations.  I saw that the ultimate goal of the god-like energy was to evolve humans so far that our brains could create an amazing blend of color, sound, and sensation that made us feel the most alive we could.  I pictured beings on other planets that had brains that could control sensation and make their lives a dazzling mix of amazing sensations.



I realized that music is nothing but vibrations, and catching and enjoying these vibrations is what makes humans more evolved than animals.  I realized that once we evolve further, we will be able to feel even more beautiful vibrations and life will be even more amazing. I pictured the end of human evolution as the energy zipping around and not having amazing sensations being limited to the human body.  I saw how LSD was not found in nature, such as mushrooms, and humans created it through technology to feel like god.  I pictured how more evolved aliens feel no suffering as we do on earth and have perfected the control of amazing sensation through technology, evolution, and different drugs or substances.



I stared at the visualizer to eliminate any uncomfortable hallucinations I saw on the floor or walls, such as the worms that formed on the carpet or the people I saw in the corner of my eye.  I saw how technology such as this visualizer is making the LSD experience more controlled and more beautiful, and hoped that in today's age, more people will be able to experience the drug and not condem it to a `1960's hippy thing.' I listened to music from 1 a.m. until the sun came up, and my hallucinations were still happening.



The only uncomfortable thing was when my family woke up and I had to turn the music off an lie in bed.  I looked out my window and the trees turned into scissors and started snipping very hard and fast.  I looked at a poster of a supermodel on my wall, and her face turned into a horse. I would pace around my room, and when I lookd in the mirror my face looked like a zombie with strange old people freckles all over it.  It didnt frighten me, but it made me realize how long the trip would last.  I finally fell asleep for about an hour, and woke up feeling very out of it.  I still saw small light patterns on the floor, but could function in every day activities.     



The experience was beautiful, and the only regret I have is taking it so late at night and getting no sleep.
