I am 19 years old and have been abusing pain killers since I was 17.



I found oxycontin when I was 18. Since the day I tried it and loved it, I was hooked (I donno mentally or physicly) but I had to have more. I went to shows to buy prescription bottles of oxy 80's, hung out with heroin junkies so I could buy them. 



I was selling drugs at the peak of my addiction, so I could afford to spend \$5-600 a week on my drug of choice. My girlfriend would steal my pills while I was sleeping and hide them in an attempt to help me get off them. I would go crazy, tearing through her house and belongings threatening and most of the time, not even remembering it. this drug controls your life.  I soon found myself doing heroin, fentynal, morphine, anything when I could not get oxys. And when I couldn't, I went deathly ill, puking everywhere. To this day I have 13 days off the drug and I am in severe pain. I have never been able to battle this drug completely no matter how much money, trouble, it has gotten me into. As I write this, I await my next score of oxycontin.
