lately i have been using special k regularly. I have been to every level obtainable from the shit. The K-h0le did not scare me it just made me think I was the universe. I was one with everything and i have been in the television shows. Then I started searching for some other type of disassociative anasthesias. I knew there had to be another drug used in veterinary clinics that would produce similar effects that ketamine produces. So I came across telazol on a web site. 



It took some time and some hustling, but I eventually was able to pick up some vials of telazol which I coined my own slang term as double K or K squared. I chose these terms because I injected less telazol than I was injecting K and I had twice the trip and it lasted for almost five hours. I was fucked up beyond all recognition. I just wanted to share my experience with everyone because I don't believe there is many people who have been turned on to this stuff. and I think it blows K away. Give this shit a try all.
