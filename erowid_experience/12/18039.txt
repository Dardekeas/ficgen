I've been given Neurontin for a few months now, for anxiety. It's not marketed for it, but apparently a lot of people taking it for their mood and whatever else they had noticed they felt less anxious.



Well, at 1000mg at once, I can say I felt pretty hazy. I'd definitely up the dose gradually before taking higher doses.



Today I took 2400mg at once. It's okay for 3600/day, but that assumes you spread it over three times in the day. Oh well, it's nicer to work at once. 



After two hours, all of a sudden it kicked in. A sensation is felt in my brain that lets me know it kicked in. I couldn't describe it except to say it's a soothing sensation in my head. Everything's very calm and relax.



Blood flow seems to feel different, especially my brain. It causes my blood vessels to contract and expand occasionally, which is odd but considered normal.



My thoughts seem slower, and a foggy haze seems to go through my head. It's best to take a little less than whatever dose this does to you at. Next time I'll take 1600.



I'm social on it, even though I might appear slow. I can definitely pull off appearing `sober' from it.



I use this a lot to sleep when I am coming off Adderall all-nighters and need to re-teach my body what sleep is. The only problem with it is that it takes 2-3 hours to kick in and leaves after 5-6 hours. Besides that and a brain fog, it is a very soothing drug.
