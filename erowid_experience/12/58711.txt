Olanzapine / Zyprexa I wouldnt say has recreational potential, but it's good as medication. When taken regularly, same time every day, for 4 weeks, it gives full effect, not like anti-depressants, its very diffirent. I feel a constant feeling of slight euphoria, it helps with anxiety, nervousness, stress etc. It's very sedating, and it works right when I start on it, 3 days after I started I noticed all its effects. 



Zyprexa elevates my mood, lets me worry less about things, it also stabalizes me so if I drink or take anything else I barely notice the comedowns. It doesnt make anything weaker, it amplifies almost everything that's intoxicating, benzo's, cannabis, and even mdma.



It has cons though, especially at beginning of treatment, in the beginning I was constantly tired, I could sleep forever, whenever. I am always hungry, and my metabolism works worse so I gain weight even if I eat less then before, and due to its sedative aspects making me extremely lazy and tired all the time it's hard to work out. I use uppers for school and work, I cant imagine anyone working or studying on a 5mg+ dose of this medicine alone.



I really recommend this, with anything, but only as a normal medicine to take as directed, it doesnt make a big diffirence after 10mg, I tried up to 35 a day and it didnt make a diffirence. It softens crashes, interacts positively to everything. And most importantly, it helps me keep my mood stable so I have no extreme downs, only ups, diffirent to other antipsychotics, I tried them all. People mistake that u dont get downs at all, I do, I just dont feel them and am slow and not thinking, hence avoiding confronting the problem.



Hope this helps, and stops people trying to abuse it, its a very powerful medication that needs to build up and doesnt reach its full potential til 4 weeks+. It's a great aid but not recreational on its own at least.
