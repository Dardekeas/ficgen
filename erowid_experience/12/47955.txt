I never thought I'd see the day that I'd be calling myself a Christian again.  I was raised in a family that was nominally Protestant, but religion was never a big topic of discussion, and we only went to church on Christmas eve.  I came to question Christianity at a very early age.  I tended to associate Christianity with close-mindedness and bigotry, as that was what I observed in those who most vocally expressed their Christian beliefs.  During my teenage years I dabbled in Wicca, Druidism, Zen Buddhism, and agnosticism.  When I was about 20, I started getting into magic mushrooms, and after an intense 5 gram trip, I found my faith in God renewed, though it was now a more monistic, pantheistic idea of God.  My spiritual views after that didn't quite seem to fit within any particular religion, though it was definitely more influenced by eastern religious traditions than by the west.



Then I found LSD.  My first significant trip on acid was a bad one.  The worst trip of my life, in fact.  But I feel it also affected my life in a positive manner, so I can't say I regret it.  After about 6 months of recovering from that trip, I decided I was ready to start doing acid again.  Every trip since then has been greatly pleasant and rewarding.  I took great pleasure in analyzing the differences between mushrooms and LSD.  I found that mushrooms seemed more earth-oriented while LSD seemed more human-oriented.  That is, with mushrooms I felt one with nature, but with acid I felt connected to all of mankind.  There seemed to be something almost `psychic' about it.



Recently, I went through a binge of doing acid every weekend for a month.  The most life-changing of these trips was on the third weekend.  I was at rave, meeting up with a friend of mine.  She had pure MDMA capsules and liquid LSD.  She said she would dose me for free if I bought a capsule off of her.  I agreed, and I took the pill while she got the dropper out.  But rather than dose me, she handed me the dropper and let me dose myself.  Well, I was a bit sloppy, and what was meant to be a drop ended up being a squirt.  I'd say I took roughly the equivalent of about 3 to 3 1/2 hits.  I knew immediately that I was in for quite a trip.  I just hoped it didn't go like my first acid trip.



As I started peaking, I found myself having a religious experience.  I felt the power of Christ come over me.  I became distinctly in tune with what I like to call Christ consciousness.  It was an all-loving, all-forgiving power that saw the oneness of mankind.  In that instant, all my previous acid trips suddenly made sense.  I asked that Christ remain with me throughout my journey in life.  I closed my eyes and said `Yes Jesus, I accept you as my personal Lord and Savior.  Thy will be done.'  I felt a sense of peace and understanding come over me, and I knew that this was the path for me.



I'm eternally grateful for LSD for helping me find oneness with Christ.  I still don't feel quite at home with most of the people who wear their Christianity on their sleeve, and I feel many of them have his message all wrong, but at least I can take comfort in my personal relationship with Christ.  By taking refuge in Him, I hope to strive to be like Him.  I plan to continue using LSD as a sacrament to guide me on this path.  Sometimes I feel like Christ came back to earth as LSD so that we could all have Christ consciousness.  Whatever the case, thank you LSD.
