I'm at home, in the evening, mostly in my room for the duration of this report.  I'm somewhat experienced with infrequent MXE use, taken orally and sublingually in the 25-75mg range over the last two years.  Three or four DXM experiences over a decade ago.. no experience with Ketamine or any of the other disassociatives.  



T+ 0:00 -- 175mg of 4-meo-pcp taken orally.  Not an empty stomach, but it's been more than 3 hours since I ate.  Very well hydrated today.  earlier in the day I've taken 10mg of yohimbine, 300mg of theobromine, with breakfast.  I've had 50mg oral of this substance months ago, it produced light threshold effects without much character.  



T+ 00:45 Already feeling pretty heavy and sedated.  Took a cold shower.  There is a slight awareness of something, but it is hard to say what, and in a strange way it is hard to say how hard it is effecting me.  At this point I would consider it dangerous to operate large machinery, despite the fact that I'm feeling more or less normal.  



T+ 2:00  I might think I know what I'm doing as a veteran tripper but I just spent 45 minutes arguing via text message.  Ha.  turn off your phone.  I'm beginning to feel increasingly detached from surroundings, but still very much in touch with train of thought.  There is a distinct physical heaviness, not unpleasant. 



T+2:30 Now the experience starts to deepen and become impossible to ignore or overcome.  This is an anesthetic for sure, but the physical feeling of it does not seem to resemble the other disassociatives I've tried.  Different bodyparts and extremities start to fade out.  My hand feels my belly, but my belly doesn't feel my hand.  Then, detailed awareness of all muscular tensions, especially in the face and neck.  Back and forth, not unpleasant.  This seems to be increasing in intensity.  



T+ 4:30 -- I cannot judge how long I was lying there, but when I get up am surprised to see that it was two hours.   I will not say that time passed slowly or quickly but that there was almost no internal awareness of the passage of time.  There was an internal dialogue / fantasy reel running in my mind but there was almost no recall of any of the content.  Vague sense of interaction and conversation with something, immediately forgotten. A dreamlike, hypogogic state, without a lot of focus on the feeling of self.



The trance state was considerably different than an  MXE hole, tranquil.  There is less of a euphoric physical component and more of a notable absence of bodily sensations, in a very anesthetic sense.  There are none of the sound distortions or spontaneous synthesizer noises characteristic of MXE, DXM or nitrous oxide here.  I am hearing birds singing outside the window, but with no embellishment or interpretation.  



T+5:00 I get up, walk around, cook and eat two eggs, and speak briefly to my roommate without issue, but seemingly as soon as I close my eyes I lose more time to this weird trance state.   It stretches quite a while.  I get up and adjust some cushions here and there.  I'm unsure how long this goes on for as at a certain point I passed into true unconsciousness. 



T+ 14:00 I wake up with slight confusion to my morning alarm.  No noticeable hangover, but a little tired as though I hadn't gotten quite enough sleep.  

  

I can't quite say whether or not I found this enjoyable or valuable.  If I was going to use this route of administration again I'd probably go with at least 250mg.
