I'd had a rather stressful week so I decided that I'd take some codeine to help me relax. As my parents were going out for the night I had the perfect opportunity to do this. 



16:30-20:30 I went to the local chemist and bought a pack of 32 Co-Codamol (500mg acetaminophen/paracetamol with 8mg codeine \& NO caffeine) and used the extraction technique mentioned in the FAQ. Once I'd done this I added 60ml of `Pholcodeine' (a cough mixture that contains codeine phosphate \& no other active ingredients) to make up for what I'd lost during the extraction and to make the mixture taste better. I then made myself a `bed' on the floor of my living room. 



20:30 I drank the mixture each time holding it in my mouth for approx 20 seconds before swallowing to help it to come on faster.



20:35 I began to feel the warmth, euphoria \& relaxation that I normally get when taking opiates. 



20:45 The itching that I normally get when taking codeine began. I normally find that if I ignore the itching it goes away within a few minutes but if I start scratching it I will continue to itch until the peak effects begin to fade. 



21:00 By this time I could hardly feel the rest of my body and the other effects peaked at around this time. Also the itching no longer bothered me.



21:30 I watched `Black Books' and I noticed that I found it far funnier that normal and the picture seemed brighter \& sharper. 



21:45 As the peak effects began to subside I drank a further 100ml of the cough medicine. Over the next few minutes the euphoria became more intense that after my initial dose. 



22:15 I eventually (when on opiates I can never be bothered to do anything apart from laying back and doing nothing) got up to put some relaxing music on. Alabama 3ï¿½s `Peace in the valley' seemed particularly appropriate as I now felt at peace with myself whereas a few hours earlier I wanted to scream at everyone who even held up my journey home by a few seconds. I also felt as though I was away from the things I hate (like a valley is isolated from the surrounding world). 



23:00 I tidied the house up before my parents came home and found out what I'd been doing. Then I took the rest of the cough medicine (approx. 50ml) and went to bed.



01:00 My parents came home so I pretended to be asleep so they wouldn't catch on to what I'd been doing. I must've fallen asleep shortly after, as I canï¿½t remember much after my parents came home.



10:30 I woke up feeling blissed out. 



In conclusion this was one of the best trips I'd had on codeine, as I didn't feel any nausea, which is quite abnormal for me. I guess this was because I was laid down or that I had gotten used to it.
