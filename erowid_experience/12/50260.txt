After school I decide to take some Ultram so I called up my friend and bought about 15 50mg doses. At about 4 o'clock I took 4 50mg pills(200mg) of Ultram. At first I didn't really feel any effects, until I sat on the couch. I had the strong desire to just be still. Eventually my entire body was itching intensely. 



At about 5 o'clock I came down to the computer room and started talking to my friends. I realized that was apologizing to people about things that happened months ago. I started to feel as if everyone was cool and that I had no enemies. 



At about 6 o'clock I had a very intense body high type feeling\ldots I also felt a very intense euphoria\ldots Everything just felt so good and so right. 



At about 10 o'clock, I had been coming down, so I decided just to sleep it out. I awoke the first time with my heart beating very fast. I had dreamt my mom found substances on my shelves and I was tackling her in slow motion. I finally got back to bed and remember yelling `sam' in the dream and awaking screaming it at the same time. The scream was not a small whisper. It woke up my entire house and my dad knocked on my door. So then I went downstairs terrified and went to take a piss. I noticed that my piss wasn't naturally shooting out, it was falling out in masses, a very peculiar effect that Ultram had on my body. 



Overall, Ultram is not an addictive drug at all. Although I take Ultram 2 or 3 times a week I feel that I can go without it. I love the sense of euphoria when I'm on it. Although I like the feeling, I also have a good sense that I am not/could not abuse Ultram.
