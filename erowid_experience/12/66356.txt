A few weeks ago I discovered a bottle of what I thought was nutmeg extract that I made at home, so I poured this bottle out into a dish to let the alcohol evaporate. Around this time i had been experimenting with kava and found it quite to my liking. So I emptied the remainder of my Kava extract bottle (about 12ml) into a different dish and waited a few days for each to evaporate off.



When they both were free of alcohol and just the oily residue was left, I gave the dish of kava 3 good long licks, just enough to coat the top of my tounge each time. Then I gave the `nutmeg' residue a lick just like the kava. To my surprise it did NOT taste like my favorite spice. It tasted like a mix between dirt and some other familiar herb.. Though I couldnt identify it. I Licked it once more and then got the idea to compare it to the herb it reminded me of most\ldots Mandrake. So i placed a minute amount of mandrake root on my tounge and then licked my residue once more. No doubt about it, I was licking Mandrake extract. So I stopped licking everything and continues with my normal daily activities.



About 40 minutes later, I was too exhausted to stand so I sat, and then had to lay down. While on my bed, the room started spinning. I started to hear a ring in my ears and I became very very warm. I felt like I was in a trance, just laying there. Until shadows started darting around my ceiling and manifesting themselves into dozens of moths at a time!  I swatted at the moths and they disappeared into dust, which glittered green red and a bit of purple as it fell. Where the dust fell on my sheets, the sheets began to BOIL! And then I fell asleep, I awoke 7 hours later to a trashed room with dishes with lickprints on them. Then I remembered it all.
