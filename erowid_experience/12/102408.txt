I began this trip in my loungeroom at roughly 1am in solitude, letting go of the slightest notions in my mind that this setting would entail dark experiences. Sitting back and going for the ride.. the best way I can handle trips. 

I place the blotter above my two front teeth and after about thirty minutes I can feel a noticeable change in my mood. It's the type of excitement mixed with anxiety. 

With NBOMe experiences I can always feel a noticeable shift that accompanies slight visuals. Firstly, my vision is subtly clouded momentarily with bright neon colours and the usual ++ visuals slowly take their place. 

After about two hours\ldots  time moved extremely quickly. I look out the window and instantly see a cardboard dragon with it's mouth open swimming in mid air. This dragon was completely nonthreatening. The shadow of the curtain (I turned the light on for comfort). turned into a ghost living inside a robe that was strung up on a noose. (this is all how my imagination perceived these visuals, weird i know.)

In the corner of my eyes snakes appear. My brothers t-shirt slowly turned into a white snake and as soon as I lost interest in this it instantly turned into a snake wrapped around a branch in the forest. Yet the background of this image was still my loungeroom. 

There's a loose toy box, and I imagine into reality a cartoonish mouse with a builders helmet on. He looks angry. Like some sort of stereotype. 

Nothing caught my memory for the next hour, it was roughly 4am when these things happened\ldots . time moved so damn fast. Even more wonderful things happened when I began watching the opening ceremony for the Olympic games. 

The male host sounded so fake and crap to me, like a butler overly complimenting a rich person and how `amazing' he was. It got so annoying and turned into a loop.. he muttered the same three words over and over that give me this feeling and began talking about Israel. I do not know why my subconscious mind brought that up. He continued about something like a huge war going to happen there\ldots .. crazyness. I just remember staring smugly at their fake smiles. 

Daylight soon broke. My backyard is absolutely beautiful. In the branches of the trees I see these weird alien shapes and patterns going on. A log turns into a black blob with thousands of moving eyes that look like the rinnegan from Naruto. The horizon turns into a cartoonish hill and as soon as this happened I was swept away with a profound sense of adventure. It felt like there were millions of incredibly complex and unique creatures to discover in this endless space. It was simultaneously daunting and wonderful. I was upset that I only get to see one which was this alien black blob thing. 

The leaves on the tree turn into one giant snake, looking evil and aggressive. Moving closer to me. I wasn't scared nor anxious, just bewildered. To be honest, a small part of me felt like a shaman taming imaginary snakes to appear in my icaros. 

The visuals died down after this. They were some of the most vibrant I've ever seen. 

If you're reading this as an insight and are contemplating dwelling in the world of psychedelics. Please remember, set and setting count. Research, have an experienced sitter. It's your inner world you see in these experiences, both hell and heaven. In the end\ldots . the fact that you're reading this indicates to me that you're interested in the human psyche and therefore wish the utmost best for all of humanity. The light always shines through :). 

Thank you for reading.
