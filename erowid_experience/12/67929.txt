I was at a party with friends and two girls that we did not know at all.  I had 2 beers, usually I can drink 6 beers and not even be that drunk.  I am a heavy drinker and I'm 6' 210 lbs.  We discovered later that one of the girls did not like my aggressive behavior and slipped some GHB into my drink.  I was fine one moment, but the next moment I was staggering through the garage to the front door and vomited violently.  I was in a cold sweat, my friends came and got me and they could not believe how wet I was with sweat, shivering and sick.



I laid on the floor in the living room with the party going on around me, I could hear everybody and what they were saying but could not move my arms or legs and could not get up.  I tried to tell my friend to call an ambulance but couldn't get the words out.  About 3 hours later, I was finally able to muster up the strength the stand up and actually felt somewhat clear headed.  I told my friend `Somebody drugged me and I'm pissed'.  I got in my car and drove home.  If I ever see anyone slip GHB into a drink I will personally confront them and make life miserable for them.
