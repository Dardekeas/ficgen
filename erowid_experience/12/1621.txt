I work at a strip club where meth is everywhere. one night the bouncer and i went in on an ounce, went back to my place and partied-for four straight days. it had goteen to the point where we couldnt go 5 minutes without a line. in between lines the sex was unreal! we were so fucked up everything looked blue, and we kept hearing music. everything seemed to be extremely clear, like things made so much more sense, colors were brighter, and it made us feel like life was perfect. never had so much fun. 



by the end of the week i had lost 30 lbs. with my job the energy i get from it is a major plus. also, i really have to look my best, so i use it to get rid of any xtra lbs i might gain. the comedown is bad, but i found a way to go around that. pro orange drink from GNC. works great! softens the comedown, it contains ephedrine, i use it when i cant find any speed, if you drink enough, you really cant tell the difference.
