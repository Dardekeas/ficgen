 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#   On the way, I noticed I was too fucked up to be driving as well, as I was in the other side of the road quite frequently and rear-ended a minivan at a 4-way stop.  Since I had weed, a pipe, and somas on me I just kept driving and never did get a call from the police about a hit and run (this is about 6 days later).  Paranoid, I race home to lock my doors and shut the car in the garage.



12:30 pm - By this time I am home safely and sound asleep while I am supposed to be working.  Passing out never felt so good.



3:30 pm - I awake, and I realize I should head back to work and clock out so I could get paid for being fucked up all day.  I make it to work safely and nobody suspects a thing.  I am such a cheapskate haha



4:30 pm - When I get home, I take 3 more soma and consume a short glass of mcnaughtons whiskey.  Just as the effects were wearing off, I had to do more.  I continued to explain to my friends about the fucked up last 18 hours or so I'd been having.



5:30 pm - I am about in the state I was late the night before.  Unable to hold my head up under its own weight, slurring words, speaking rubbish, total loss of motor skills and coordination.  I proceeded to drink a couple beers and smoke some weed and cigarettes.  



6:30 pm - Still wasted beyond belief, I think it might be a good idea to take the remaining 3 out of my original 20 somas with another glass of whiskey.  By this time, one of my friends is ripping on me because I'm so freakin wasted and I remind him of his soma experience a few days earlier to shut him up (He took 3 and was acting like a 7th grade girl getting drunk for the first time).  In a vain attempt to load a bowl of shake, I spill weed all over my pants and the floor but don't really care all that much.



7:30 pm - Once again I am delerious and not too aware of my body or surroundings.  I tell my friends I'm gonna pass out before I hurt myself, and they agree its probably a good idea.



8:30 pm - Sound asleep once again, 23 hours after I purchased the somas.  I end up waking around 11 when my friend shows up and I tell him the story of how wasted I got off soma for a day straight.



Restrospective - This was definetly one of the funnest 24 hours I'd had in a long time.  As you can probably tell, I have a problem with taking things to the excess.  Alchohol and weed definetly enhance the effects of this drug, which are nothing like hydros or any other pills I've ever taken.  Another thing, the one soma that was unaccounted for was taken over time through the act of snortation.  I would crush out a little line of the stuff and snort it when I would take the others orally.  I hope this experience was helpful but more likely it was just entertaining.
