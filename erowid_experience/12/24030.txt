I started my drug use history at the young age of 14. At that age in my city, I was still finding it hard to make the contacts with which to score the illegal drugs such as weed or acid, but I had plenty of alternatives at home. I spent the 9th and 10th grades using the prescription and over-the-counter drugs in my parents medicine cabinet and in hindsight I can tell you that most of the things which are `legal' can much more dangerous than the things which are `illicit'. 



I was curious about everything, and had taken a dangerous amount of motion sickness pills (Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride) that nearly put me in a coma. The seriousness of that situation didn't sink in, and I continued pill popping. My parents had a prescription for Halcion (Trizolam). Halcion was popular at the time because it was a fast and effective sleep aid and unlike other tranquilizers, it didn't leave a person with a groggy hangover when it wore off.  I loved it. When my Grandmother died and we cleaned out her apartment, I found a full bottle of Halcion in her medicine cabinet. I snatched it right away and kissed that semester goodbye\ldots I was there, but don't recall much of it. 



It was the perfect drug for someone who was bored at school. I would take one at lunchtime, and it what felt like less than 15 minutes, the day would be over. 



It is difficult to describe the experiences because the memories of it include little more than the onset and come down. I recall that after taking the pill a very pleasurable head rush would begin within 15 minutes. It felt as if my head were a balloon full of helium and it was floating off my body. There was a acute giddiness which followed and a complete loss of inhibition that was exactly like the loss of inhibition that accompanies alcohol. 



I recall people noticing my odd behavior when the drug kicked in, and even asking if I was drunk. Memories of anything following this stage are gone. The next experience usually involved `coming to'\ldots a point where memory comes back and I was always somewhere else, doing something else. The typical duration of the black out was 2 hours. There would be a giddy high that was still going strong and it would last for an hour or so. The final stage was a few hours of general calmness with a complete lack of anxiety. 



Because of the pleasure of the drug combined with the `shortening' of the day it caused, I began to experiment with the drug. I took a very high dose of 4 pills and went to school like an idiot. Instead of the giddy high, I experienced complete incoherence. Everything had a blue hue to it, and there were trails to motion. I couldn't verbally respond to people speaking to me. The task of talking was just too complex. That is all I remember, and that was just the onset. Amazingly, I didn't get kicked out of school that day or taken to the hospital. In truth, I don't recall what happened at all. I can only imagine that I walked home on autopilot, probably staggering a little, and went to bed for at least 16 hours. That is the scary part about this drug..there is a blank in my experience and I am not sure what I have done.
