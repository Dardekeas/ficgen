Last night I experienced a fairly frightening incident with some weed. I've smoked pretty irregularly for a few years and recently have been smoking about a bowl a day. I occasionally experience intense body highs and even panic attacks, especially when I haven't smoked for a while.



Yesterday, I had very little to eat due to a great deal of stress, and later on in the evening met up with some friends to smoke. My friend packed two bowls and I found myself quite high after about 20 minutes. After an hour or so, my friend said he had to go to bed, so I headed out. My apartment is about a 10 or 15 minute walk from his, so I wasn't too worried, even given the intense state I was in.  However, about a block away from his place, my vision darkened significantly and all I could make out were blurry red lights of cars.  I tried to convince myself that I was just being paranoid and panicking a little bit and to keep on going. Then I found myself unstable and basically unable to walk.  I sat down in front of someone's house to try to collect myself.  At this point, my hearing was a bit funny too -- not that I had completely lost it but more of a ringing, quieting sensation.



At this point, I try to stand up again and am somewhat incapacitated and panicky, so I call my friend to come outside.  He helps me walk back to his place, but I can barely make it up the stairs without falling.  Once inside, I make a move for the couch but black out again and just collapse on the floor next to it.  He helps me up and once I've been lying on the couch for a few minutes, the awful physical sensations begin to subside.  I've never had such a strong or frightening reaction to smoking pot, and the only thing I can think to attribute it to is my not having eaten.
