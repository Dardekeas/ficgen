Got a couple of large bags of this sent to me from Africa. I had previously tried the so-called 10x extract and was not impressed - tasted awful and did nothing. The latest stuff though definitely appears to be the real deal (in that there is a noticeable effect).



I wouldn't describe it as either pleasant or unpleasant. I would say it is very similar to taking a prozac for the very first time. I feel different but not overly happy. There's a general body tingle and the feeling of `coming up' on an ecstasy tablet although the euphoria never actually arrives. It would be interesting to hear from anybody who used it in the same way as an actual anti-depressant i.e. taking it over a long period of time with some regularity.



I have ingested, smoked and snorted. Similar effects every time.  I would conclude that  there is no `narcotic' element to this plant but potential for benefits over a period of time.
