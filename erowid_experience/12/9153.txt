I was at a friends house, lot of people there. I picked up the salvia 2 days before and tried it with minimal effects. This time I asked my one buddy to accompany me in the car while I did it.  I get into my car and pack the bowl and start hitting it. After I was done, I went completely numb, I felt as though my body and brain were completely dead. I sat in this expierence for a couple minutes when the song that was playing in the car said `step inside'.



Well that must have fired something off in my brain because seconds later I was desperately trying to pack the bowl with more salvia, I thought that if I smoked more I would be able to `step inside'. First hit off the bowl and I was gone. It was like the first bowl just kept me on some plateau and the next hit blew me into space. I definitely got to step inside, but that wasn't a good thing. I was transported to some crazy place\ldots  and all I can imagine was a lady that was showing me something. I can't even put words to it b/c it was just like raw emotion. At this point I got extremely terrified. More scared then i've ever been in my life. I frantically wanted out of the car and to lay on the grass, i thought that was my only escape. Once I got out of the car, I completely changed.



Into a MADMAN.



I started laughing  hysterically, not a fun laugh, but a very very evil laugh. I was kneeling in between my car and the car door. I started to swear and say horrible things. A pizza delivering boy was coming up the drive way and I kept talking about killing him. And killing people at the party. It was disgusting to say the least. After a while I went back into the car. I couldn't even control my head, it kept going back and forth and hitting the side of the car. Then I had to go to the grass again. I hit the grass and started to swear and spit. After a while it wore off and I was back to normal. To even try to explain a salvia trip is nearly impossible. I don't think there are words to describe what you feel. Anyway, that is the last time I'm going to do salvia in a loong time.
