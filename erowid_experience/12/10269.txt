Hitting the big 4-0 was a traumatic experience. I started to feel lethargic, and a malaise/mild depression/light blue funk settled over my suddenly middle aged brain and body.



I live in Canada, which is kind of like being 20 and still living with your parents. Its easy, usually comfortable, but you are forced to live under rules `for your own good', even though they make no sense to you. If that's not bad enough, my mom \& dad weren't in the hip pocket of the multinational pharmaceutical companies, like the Canadian government.



I did manage to find some DHEA from the US, sold under the counter to me by an acquaintance who runs a health food store.



I took 1 100 mg capsule each morning. After about one week, I noticed I didn't shriek  `Aw, shit!' anymore when the clock radio came on at 7:30 AM. In place of a heavy, tired, annoyed feeling as my feet hit the bedroom floor was a feeling of energy, a slightly buzzy, excited feeling that I used to feel in my early 20's as I would greet the new day. Every day felt like the first day of summer.



I felt greater confidence while using DHEA. My sex drive increased, as did the pleasure you get from completing `the deed' (OH, YEAH!!).



I kept on the recommended daily dose. My goal was not to bulk up. It is a great mood elevator and confidence builder for male Boomers.



The drug company sycophants that rule this land have made possession of DHEA illegal, unless by doctor's prescription. I can't get it anymore. US companies won't ship it to Canada.



I really miss it.
