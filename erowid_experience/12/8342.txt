In the summer of 95 I was well into the rave scene and was doing ecstasy on a regular basis. Almost every Friday night I would take tablets sold as ecstasy and go to clubs or one off raves in and around London.



As usual after work I would meet up with my mates in a local bar and have a few beers and wait for our dealer to turn up with some `pills'. This night when he arrived he had some unusually named pills called Fido-Dido (A cartoon character from a soft drink).



We ingested the pills and waited for something to happen while we were getting changed ready to go out clubbing. The effects took an unusually long time to start happening and it wasn't until we were in a cab on the way to the club that I started feeling `a bit strange'. I was well used to the ecstasy buzz and this wasn't the ecstasy buzz !. Everyone was feeling quite scared and speculation was rife about what was in the pills, Guesses ranged from Ketamine to Heroin!



The physical effects were not to dissimilar to a strong dose of MDEA in that one could not dance or, in the worst cases, stand up properly. The mental effects we still quite like MDMA but with a psychedelic edge as though I had also taken 2cb or ketamine.



After the initial shock everyone had a brilliant time. Not much dancing happened but everyone was chatting away and generally enjoying them selves.



The next day everyone wanted more info on what they had taken and wanted to try it again sometime soon. This didn't happen until a few years later, a batch of `Euro' pills also contain a high dose of MBDB. We eventually found out what was in the pills because a rave magazine of the time, in conjunction with \href{http://www.ecstasy.org/testing/pillstilSept.html}{ecstasy.org published precise details of what was in the Fido-Dido tablets a 180MG dose of MBDB}!
