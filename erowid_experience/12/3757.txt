I never heard of anyone smoking MDA.  I decide to try it myself.  I purchased 200mg of pure MDA crystals from a friend, and decided to committ 40mg to the experiment.  I added the 40mg of MDA to 50ml of water.  I allowed the solution to dissolve and I took the PH of the solution the soluion read 6.8.  I then added a 50/50 solution of lye and water to the solution until it read a PH of 10. I then added 6 ml of naptha and let sit for 6 hrs, and then I filtered off the solevent, and repeated. after repeating 4 times I allowed the solevent to evaporate and I was left with 37.45 mg of a crystaline solid.  I scraped the crystal up and loaded them into my DMT pipe.



I decided to smoke the MDA similiar to the way I smoke DMT as fast as possible.  I took my first inhalation of this disgusting tasting smoke and held it as long as possible, I was able to finish off the crystals in my second toke.  I layed back and waited for the effects to set in.



After about 15s I felt a huge rush oh happiness, love, and empathy run across my body.  I felt extremly warm, and the effects were so strong I felt as though I couldnt walk. 6min into the experience I got up to check my pupils which were extremely dialated. after the peak subsided I was able to walk and carry on normal activities, the total effects lasted about 90 min.
