The purpose of the session was purely to experiment with the substance TMA-2, merely observe. Time of experiment -- noon.



T+ :00 The 22.3 mgs of TMA-2 HCL was stirred into a banana/peach smoothie and drunk. I had eaten some bran cornflakes and had a cup of coffee 3 hours prior to ingesting the TMA-2. I also took some Papaya Enzyme with the TMA-2 to combat the possible nausea and/or diarrhea (neither of which manifested).



T+ :22 Notice the first very slight body tremor. Get that familiar sensation of my consciousness beginning to creep outwards.

Body temperature drops.



T+ :30 Urinate.



T+ :50 I am now very relaxed and yawning. The effects (described at T+ :22) are more pronounced -- but still weak. This is now similar in nature to a low oral dose (5-10mg) of 2C-B or 10mg 2C-T-7. Colours slightly more vibrant.



T+ :55 Body vibrations on the increase -- the release and containment of energy.



T+ 1:12 Limbs become stretchy with very slight boundary distortion. Some slight distortions in peripheral vision.



T+ 1:30 Warm rushes -- not too pronounced. Beginning to be somewhat restless.



T+ 2:00 Time for a walk. My tripping partner and I leave our flat and walk to the river Thames. It is bitterly cold but very stimulating, as the walking appears to be brining the TMA-2 ``out'' a bit. 

We both feel that walking is satisfying even though our bodies were confusingly fatigued.



T+ 3:00 Return to flat and decide to watch Baraka. I notice how effortlessly I am able to slip into flow states -- more effortlessly than usual. This reminds me of LSD and so does the remainder of the trip.



T+ 5:00 I am feeling very relaxed and most of the effects have diminished at this stage. Although I still find it easy to reach flow states as before. 



T+ 5:30 I decide to leave my friends flat and begin the 1.5-hour train ride to the other side of London. 

For another 2 hours I ponder my illusory self - I can only ever reflect on what it was, never on what it is. At that point of reflection I am not the perceiver -- I am just the difference. Am I the fleeting opportunity for perception to exist in the experience of matter?



I obsess over the idea that evolution is paradoxically driven by entropy. Duped by consciousness. Ha Ha.



Bricoleur.
