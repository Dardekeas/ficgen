I am 14 years old.  I use pot everyweek-end, and have tried most other drugs.  I have heard about catnip being used as a mild intoxicant.  I couldn't find much else about it, such as experience reports, so I decided to find out for myself.  I went to the petstore and asked where the catnip was.  The lady showed me and I selected a 1/2 ounce bag of Four Paws Super Catnip Leaves and Blossoms.  It looked surprisingly similar to shake weed.  It was green and had an exotic cigarette smell.  I was very intrigued.  



Anyway, the price was amazingly low.  \$2.44 for this 1/2 ounce bag.  It was a great deal.  I purchased it and showed it to my friends.  They were intrigued also but declined to try it.  So I planned to try it the next morning by myself.  I plucked out a few grams and placed it on a piece of paper.  I then broke up and poured out the contents of a Marlboro Light cigarrette on the same piece of paper.  It was 2 parts catnip to 1 part tobacco.  (Twice as much catnip)  I rolled 3 fairly large joints and proceeded to smoke.  I smoked 2 of the joints, and then I had to stop as my throat was getting irritated.  The smoke however was aromatic and pleasant tasting.  It tasted like a Camel Jade.  I put the last joint back in the bag.  



I felt mildly intoxicated, with some zoning out and a little strange walking.  There wasn't any euphoria that I could tell.  The feeling lasted about an hour and was strange but not at all overwhelming.  the rest of the day I was tired.  It wasn't unpleasant however, and I plan to do it again later with some marijuana.  I suspect it will enhance the pot high somehwhat.  Well anyway I have tons left over.  I think I shall give some to my cat.  :)  It's supposed to make my cat happy and playful.  That's what the box it came in says.
