During the summer of my senior year my best friend and I began experimenting with his mom's oxycontin prescription. Our original plan was just to try it a few times and then stop, but oxycodone had other plans. Soon we had moved up from taking 2 40 mg pills to do before school the entire week and where taking nearly 20 80 mg pills each in one week. 



It went on for 4 months and by then we were obviously addicted since we were only snorting them. On average we went through more than 100 mgs a day and whatever we didn't use we sold. It was a profitable business for us since we got all profit. Most times we ran out before the demand was met and in the end I even started to make trips south about an hour like once a week to get entire bottles from a guy I knew just to keep our customers happy. 



By now I realized that I had a serious problem. If there was a day I didn't have OC I went crazy. I had the shortest temper that can be imagined and I would often flip on or be deceitful toward the people that mattered most to me.



It all came crashing down in October 2006 at the homecoming dance. I went outside to my Jeep to get a bottle of deodorant and was escorted by a Deputy Sherriff since we were supposed to sign out with an adult to go to the parking lot. While I was looking for the stick I accidentally uncovered my bottle of pills. The sheriff immediately asked me to step away from the car and got a warrant. I was charged with possession of a Schedule II narcotic and could have faced up to 1 year in the county jail. 



By now I was already accepted to the Virginia Military Institute and worried about my future there. I didn't even know if I was going to be able to finish high school. Eventually I was accepted at a military school. I could continue my passion for wrestling that I have had ever since in can remember. I even ended up placing 2nd in the state that year.



My story isn't really about how euphoric or exciting the drug was (although it was fucking amazing). It is incredibly addictive.
