 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



I would like to give a little background about my drug usage. I'm a very experienced drug user. I've done shrooms, DXM (over 40 times), Morphine, codeine, valium, and an array of pharmaceuticals. I've done all the basics, weed, alcohol, all kinds of inhalants, dramamine and etc.  I had also done freon before. Now that you know my drug background, we can get down to the experience itself. 



It started out, I was sittin in my room and I was smooking a cigarette and started having a craving to huff freon. Since I live in an apartment, I have an abundance of it. Freon is actually quite easy, cheap and fun to do. It can be almost a spirtual experience as well, if I'm in the right state of mind.



TIME-12:40a.m.- I snuck out my window and preceeded to head toward the air conditioners right outside my apartment. I unscrewed the cap, and found a tool to press in the little needle to make the freon shoot out. I stuck my mouth close to the tube sticking out and pressed the needle in and started to huff. I used quick short but deep breaths, doin that over and over again very fast to get the full effects. Little did I know, that this would probably be one of the most profound and exciting experiences.



I looked up and the next thing I knew, EVERYTHING was taller than me, even the grass! I was like a little bug. I felt as if I could barely move, but finally gathered the strength. On the way, I talked to spiders and ants of all kind. I was as happy as can be. As I was walking a spotlight was following me everywhere I went. It turned out to be a streetlight. I felt like I was on a stage because of this. At this point, it felt like a couple hours. But it had only been a few minutes.  I felt like I had connected with God at this point and that I had done something amazing with my life, something important. 



Finally, I came out of the experience. Shocked and EXTREMELY euphoric. The thing that puzzled me the most, is that I thought I was moving around but I never moved from that spot, and the ultimate thing is I was with a god and never felt so blissful before. 



The bad thing is that I get pretty tired but then again I am restless after the experience. It wears me out but it's very worth it.
