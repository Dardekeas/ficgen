Ok, It's about 4:30pm, and I just got home with a brand new cracker and a case of whippets.  Excitement floods over me as I crack my very first whippet, and fill a balloon.  Hyperventilate, INHALE!  Wow\ldots   My skin began tingling, and a sound similar, but unlike a truck-horn began repeating in my mind.  I tried filling a balloon for my sister in this state, which I found nearly impossible.  My hands didn't want to function quite right.  Almost as if the motor function part of my brain had gone stupid.  



After about 5 minutes, I sobered up, and decided to do a `double'.  This is two whippets in one balloon.  More = Better, right?  OOOOhhhh ya!  I hyperventilated and inhaled a lungful.  Then, after holding it (much like I do with hashish smoke), I exhaled quickly, and inhaled the remainder of that balloon.  The truck-horn noise returned, and the tingling sensation grew in intensity until my entire body was numb.  This buzz lasted a bit longer than the other, and I began filling a balloon for someone else who had just smoked some cannibis.  Yet again, my hands don't want to work correctly, and they seem almost `weak'.  My fingers didn't have the dexterity or strength to close the cracker on a whippet and fill a balloon.  This started to annoy me, so I passed it on to my sister until I could sober up.  Probably 3-5 minutes later, which felt like 30 minutes, I was sober, and wanting another hit.  I then continued doing whippets until I had finished the entire 24 pack.  This gave me a horrible migraine, and I slept for nearly 16 hrs.  



The effects were very similar to Tetrafluroethane, but don't last as long, and probably less likely to cause brain damage.
