          For quite some time I had entertained the idea of trying cocaine. My first experience with a drug was with marijuana at the age of 14. 3 years later I had gone on to try alcohol, nitrous oxide, and tobacco. I now wanted to try a stimulant and see what all the commotion was about. The occasion came up sort of unexpectedly. I slept over at a family members home and around 11:00 pm my cousin, we will call him randy, came home from work. He proceeded to show me what looked like a little piece of chalk and told me that when his parents fell asleep he would introduce me to the drug. I had expressed my interest in cocaine to Randy before and he decided it would be best for me to try the drug under his guidance. Well alas tired from a long day at work randy fell asleep and I did not try the drug that night.	

         I awoke the next morning around 11:00 am to the sound of Randy calling my name telling me to wake up. He was already busy crushing the cocaine into a fine powder. We talked for a bit about his past experiences and telling me what to expect. I made it a point not to smoke any marijuana or drink any alcohol wanting to feel the full effects of the coke. Finally around 12:00 pm Randy set up 2 lines of what looked like really small lines of the coke. He assured me that they were `standard' size, and the small mountains of cocaine I see guys snorting in movies would probably kill me. I anxiously waited as he fished in his wallet for a crisp bill to roll up to use as my snorting device. Finally he pulled one out, rolled it, and handed it to me. He instructed me to exhale slowly then snort in the drug. I did this to the first line with my left nostril. Then Waited about 10 seconds and proceeded to snort the second line with my right nostril. It had a very distinct chemical smell, nothing i can compare it to. At first i was extremely disappointed. I did not feel a thing. Already in my head I was thinking people are stupid for wasting their money and getting hooked on it. I told randy this and he confidently told me to wait for it to `kick in'. 

	He went to the bathroom while I proceeded to the living room. I then spontaneously made the decision to go talk to my cousins next door neighbor which I had been meaning to do but never got around to it. The walk over there must have gotten the juices flowing because all of a sudden I got an incredible rush that I can only describe as multiple mini orgasms going off in my head and chest. After this I knew I was officially `on one'. 
	
        Apart from the initial rush the effects were really subtle. They consisted of a feeling of alertness, being slightly more talkative, and an overall feeling of well being. After having the quick talk with the neighbor I proceeded to randy's car where he was waiting for me to go shoot some pool. The music playing on the way there was alot more enjoyable than it usually is for some reason(im not a big fan of hip hop). I kept sniffing and playing with my nose like you see on tv, and I discovered my throat felt numb and it was hard to swallow. We got to the pool hall and played a little while. 

[Erowid Note: Erowid does not condone the act of driving under the influence of any substance.] 

	After about 30 minutes from when I initially snorted the cocaine I began to feel the `crash'. I felt a combination of tiredness with sleepiness, and a slight feeling of wanting more. The effects of the cocaine were a lot more apparent after they had gone. kind of like the saying you don't know what you have until its gone. I did not confide in Randy that I felt the urge for more because I did not want him to think me weak minded. My conclusion on the drug is that it really is over hyped. In my opinion the price of the drug, for the feeling you get, is not worth it. It has been a day since the experience and for now I have decided not to touch the drug again.
