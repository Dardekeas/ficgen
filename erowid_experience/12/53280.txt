 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



So earlier today I was bored and had a lack of any mind altering substances or the like, so I decided to look on here for inhalants and such.



Gas was my substance of choice. I had been trying it through the little tube in those red gas cans with the gas filled pretty much to the top. That didn't work. So later on I removed the cap and basically took bong hits straight from the hole on the top.



About 15-20 hits in my world started to seriously warp.



There was this rythymatic wah-wah sound and it kept getting louder and louder and louder then all of a sudden I just blacked out. I hadn't realized I blacked out and I started feeling so helpless. Suddenly the world was a giant pill, and I was watching it spin



Then one half of it broke off and I felt a sharp, extremely sharp pain. I thought I was dying and the world was disappearing before my eyes, suddenly the pill came back together and I was screaming but couldn't feel anything, Time had ceased to exist. I scrambled to find something in this black abyss and I finally found it. I had grabbed a plant in my garden. I kept focusing on it and then tried to focus on it's surroundings. It was at that point I actually realized where I was. I looked up and saw the open gas can on the fence(rockish thing about 3 foot high) and the sharp pain I felt was when I fell off the ledge and hit my head on one of those little rock fences around a garden. It was bleeding horribly and was a knot the size of a goosebump.



This is an hour later and I had to frantically cover up the smell and plot a story to tell my parents. They say I'll be okay, but I feel so horrible right now. I'm a fucking idiot.
