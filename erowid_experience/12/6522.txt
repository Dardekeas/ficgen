This is a little anecdote about my experience with ephedra. I'll try to be as precise as possible, but without becoming overly clinical.



Friday night 18:45 



I just took 4 ephedra supercaps with 833mg dried ephedra each, containing a total of 267 milligrams (about .009 ounce) ephedrine. I'm feeling pretty exhausted at the moment, since the previous night was `queens night', which means I've been reveling in the streets all night long and have gotten only a few hours' sleep. I also drank a couple of beers earlier this afternoon, which can negatively affect the ephedra experience. I'm drinking a cup of coffee at the moment, because the caffeine in coffee intensifies the effects of ephedra. 



19:39 



I feel a pleasant tingling, `gooseflesh' sensation over my scalp, and I feel slightly restless. Furthermore, I don't feel like sitting behind my computer and typing anymore, so I pace restlessly around a bit in my room. But at the moment I feel great, and I'm no longer tired at all. I decide to put on some relaxing music (Enya) and clean up the mess in my room. 



20:05 



The tingling sensation is starting to become pretty strong now, I notice that I can make the sensation even more intense if I concentrate on them. The typing is getting a bit more difficult because of my trembling, sweaty hands. My tiredness has completely disappeared, one hour ago I almost fell asleep, now I feel very active and I would like to go and do something. Futhermore I feel a bit detached, as though someone else is typing this. 



20:40 



The phone rings, but I cannot concentrate very well on the conversation, and what the caller wants to say simply doesn't get through to me. When I hear myself talking, it sounds as if I am talking unusually slowly. I still feel wonderful, only a bit nervous and sweaty. I am still restless. if I were at a party, I would probably want to dance. 



21:05 



I am bursting with energy, but I cannot find any activity to put that energy into. So I bounce between newspaper, radio, tv and computer - and also between teakettle and toilet, because this stuff make me thirsty. 



21:34 



I still have the tingling, but I am more relaxed now, enough that I can sit quietly and watch television. 



21:56 



I still feel a bit nervous, and it's hard to concentrate on the typing: I can think much faster than I can type. I also have problems concentrating on TV, I can follow the stand-up comedians, but with the news I become easily distracted. 



22:15 



The ephedra has been working for two-and-a-half hours now, the effect is still very pronounced and has not abated appreciably. Although the tingling sensation is tapering off a bit. Another effect of ephedra is that it makes me more sociable, assertive, and kinder. I just spoke to a housemate, and it felt as if I had a strong bond with him (in fact I hardly know the guy). If I were to meet someone who didn't know me, he/she would probably find me friendly but a bit confused. Confused because its hard for me to concentrate on anything for longer than a second. 



23:07 



I still feel good, and not as nervous as before. I sit quietly watching the TV, a documentary about war victims and refugee camps that affects me much more strongly than it normally would. I find that I feel much more empathetic. 



23:18 



Now and then the tingling returns. I think I must have drunk two litres (half a gallon) of tea. This ephedra makes me thirsty, and now I think its time to have a nice, cold beer. 



Saturday 00:17 



Still wide awake, it appears that I won't be getting sleepy anytime soon, although it has been almost 5 hours since I took the ephedra. 



02:43 



I'm back to normal now, although I still feel some light tingling in my scalp. I remain wide awake, but my body is beginning to feel tired. The `side-effects' - the sweating, trembling, and detachment that I experienced earlier are gone now. 



04:04 



Still no signs of sleep, this suprises me a bit, since I took the caps 8 hours ago! All other effects are gone now. 



05:38 



I'm still awake. The ephedra is working much longer than I anticipated, about 10 hours now, but I think I should be able to get to sleep in an hour or so. Moreover, my appetite is beginning to return, which is not so strange since I've only eaten only a few slices of toast in the last 10 hours. My body feels exhausted at the moment. 



+/- 6:15 



I finally fell asleep, with no problems. 



12:00 



The awakening. It has been a somewhat restless night, I awoke a couple of times for 15 minutes or so, and then fell back asleep again. I also have the impression I slept very lightly. Although I slept for only five hours, I feel wide-awake.
