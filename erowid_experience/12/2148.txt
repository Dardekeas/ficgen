Some time ago I had a strange experience with Salvia Divinorum. As usual I was lying in bed in complete darkness, listening to some trance-like music by the `Self-transforming machine elves`. I should mention that the Salvia was ingested through the mucous membrane. About half an hour before I had taken 75mg of Moclobemide. Couldn't determine any intensification.



My body had already dissolved, only the most prominent stimuli came through and were sort of distorted\ldots  This time it was rather unpleasant. There was always some itching and scratching, which prevented me from letting go completely. Then when I sensed some tickling in my hand (although I didn't really see it as my hand) I realized that my awareness was totally concentrated on that spot. Somewhere in that thought it made ping in my brain; not a real sound, but sort of. What was that, I thought, and tried to rethink it. ping, again. Then I understood that just at the moment, my awareness was watching itself, although I couldn't really finish that thought, as in my brain was suddenly doing pingpingping\ldots  all the time. - It was a feedback-loop, a real feedback-loop, in my brain.
