i have been very experienced with research chems, and jumped at the chance of being one of the pioneers to try 5-meo-dalt. this unusual substance is kind of brownish, with a heavy chemical odor. (maybe its not the purest?) there is little to no taste, which is very unusual. (I tend to have a very high tolerance to tryptamines, having taken 150 mg's of dipt without much effect before, and my friend took 75 mg's of the same batch and went to the hospital) as with any new substance i still start off small.



(00.00) i ingest 20 mg's of 5-meo-dalt orally.



(01.00) nothing is noted on effects, good mindset, but nothing really worth mentioning, so i take another 20 mg's orally



(01.45) still nothing, so i insufflate 10 mg's.



(02.15) maybe a slight gittery effect. but nothing to be impressed with.



(02.25) im not sure if this substance should be smoked as a base, or not, but i do know of people who smoke it, so i smoke 10mg's in a cigarette.  

 

(02.30) now i can feel some gradual effect, but i cant predict where this is going, so i smoke another 5mg's in a cigarette.



(02.40) im still feeling about the same, so i vaporive 5mgs in a glass. 

 

(03.00) im still at about a +1 and according to other guinnea pigs ive spoken to about this substance, they reccommend 8-30 mgs, and relate it as being the tryptamine's ecstasy. im not sure what to think. ive ingested a couple different tryptamines each week, and probably have a high cross tolerance, so i think i will lay off the chems for my tolerance to go down, and give this substance another try.
