Set: My house, Friday night, bored, alone, wanting to sample the 4-FMP (4-Fluoro-alpha-methylphenethylamine, 4-FMPEA, 4-FA) I'd recently acquired.



Setting: Pretty normal Friday night, although as I was alone at home and everyone I knew was out of town, I was not sure what to do and was feeling pretty bored, plus winter was just starting which ruled out running around town. My general mood was good though and I had no serious troubles pressing on my mind. 



Dose: 160 mgs.



T+0:00 - Ingested 160 mgs. 4-FMP



T+0:30 - There is a tingle in my face and my palms are starting to sweat. Nervous anticipation? Perhaps.



T+1:15 - There is definitely something here, it feels nice, no waves of euphoria or happiness, but I feel good. My extremities tingle slightly and I am very alert, I look in the mirror and notice myself smiling. Music sounds good; some good psy-trance is the perfect choice for the occasion. Start to get the cleaning of the house out of the way for the weekend to come.



T+2:00 - I am left feeling a little disappointed. My body is warm and I have energy and motivation, but there is no bliss and no psychedelic aspects associated with this chemical at all (not that I was expecting any). I am reminded of simple amphetamine a great deal, but the stimulation does not seem to be as forceful as methamphetamine, more calm and relaxed. No nervous `I must do all 1000 things which are rushing through my head simultaneously' sort of feel.



T+3:00 - Decided to supplement with 120 mgs. MDMA. Was that a good idea? Hope there's no serious interaction about to take place. I doubt it though; this stuff feels pretty damned harmless.



T+3:30 - Hmm\ldots  It feels like someone is sticking me randomly with a pin.



T+4:00 - Feeling VERY nice now. Music has begun to sound infinitely better, have no desire to move anymore. Finish the cleaning tomorrow! Eyes closing in that spaced out ``e'' way, jaw starting to chatter a little, having trouble focusing. I am sure this is just the MDMA talking now, but it certainly does feel damn good and strong for a 120 mg dose. No negative aspects to it. (Pin-prick feeling has gone away.)



T+5:30 - Peaking hard, I do not normally feel quite as nice as this when I take just 120 mgs. of MDMA. Is there a connection? My instincts tell me yes. This is nothing like when I combine ``speed'' and MDMA.

----------------------------------------------------------



About this time, my flatmate came through my lounge room (she has her own, separate lounge) and asked ``what the F*\#K did you take''? I guess my eyes were as big as plates! The next three hours or so I spent on the computer chatting on IRC, listening to music while lying on the sofa and watching a bit of television. I didn't make any more notes during this time for two reasons. One, I was bored with the concept of writing a trip report and two, nothing ``note-worthy'' (so to say) was taking place. I was able to fall asleep at about the T+9:00 mark, and slept for about four hours. The next morning, there was just a typical MDMA style hangover with a touch of lethargy and mental numbness.



Conclusion:

It was a good experience and I definitely think there is some synergy between 4-FMP and MDMA, but this particular substance does not overly impress me, especially on its own. From what I had heard about it, I was expecting a little bit more of a bliss element to be present with the 4-FMP alone, but it just wasn't there, at least not to an impressive degree. I have taken 4-FMP on three other occasions, twice alone, and once more with MDMA again. I found the same synergy to be present as with this experience on my subsequent MDMA/4-FMP combination. Alone, I find it to be a simple amphetamine-like stimulant with an even annoying edge to it at times. I'd even compare it to dextroamphetamine on many levels. Even meth is more euphoric to me, and I don't find meth that euphoric at all.
