I noticed you did not have any experiences on hydromorphone, and since this is the first time I have done this particular drug, I would submit a report.



I obtained a 4mg pill of hydromorphone from an undisclosed location, and chopped it up into a fine powder.



I snorted 2mg of the substance. No burn. 



I wait 10 min.. And feel I am breathing slower.. And my hands are clammy and there is a sense of being wanted, and I just nod and take in everything around me as being good.



I tell people exactly what I am thinking, and am generally pleased so far.  So I decide to insufflate the last 2mg.



I am in a NOD now.. It feels so good to sit and enjoy the moment, it is not close to oxycontin feelings or hydrocodone, I would relate this high to heroin, to the best of my knowledge, and everything is A ok in my book.



This high is incredible, and I am slightly itching my arms, and the back of my kneecaps itch a little bit.



I've noticed there is a large amount of clamminess feeling to this drug, I prefer an oxycontin high to this, I'm more stimulated on that and europhic beyond pleasure.. This is bliss indeed, but in a whole different way.



I would recommend any opiate lover to try this once, or twice. But I can see strong reason why it is so addictive.
