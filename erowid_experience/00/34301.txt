[Erowid Note: 1 gram of tramadol is considered an extremely high dose, see \href{http://www.erowid.org/pharms/tramadol/tramadol\_dose.shtml}{Tramadol Dosage}]








I'm 23 years old and have been taking Tramadol every day for nearly 5 months.  I prefer real opiates but it's hard to find a consistent source not to mention they're far too expensive.  When I first began taking tramadol I did it to compensate for lack of opiates.  The first few times I took 100mg and didn't notice a great deal.  





I continued to take 100mg a day for a week and noticed little except that it kept me from craving opiates.  I wait a week and try taking 150mg now that my tolerance for anything is mostly gone.  I was some what surprised.  The Tramadol gave me a warm fuzzy feeling similar to that of hydrocodone but not as intense.  I sat in front of my computer for three hours messing around on the internet.  I sat there chain smoking and smiling at myself.  It made me feel mighty happy.  From that day I haven't gone but a day or two here and there without taking the shit.  I'm terribly addicted but not too upset about it for it is easy and cheap for me to obtain it.  





I must mention that there are some serious side effects I experienced during my first month of taking Tramadol.  I took(and still do) about 800mg-1000mg a day.  Before I gained a tolerance it, one day I took 400mg at once.  Generally before I had taken 150mg at a time.  





About an hour after taking the 400mg I began to feel the happy excited feeling I always did when taking it but much more intense this time.  After two hours of happiness I began to get sleepy.  To my surprise I started to enter an opiate dream.  It was great until I was jolted by my body seizing.  I seized twice, each for about five seconds.  





After that the muscles in my arms would contract causing my hands to flap around uncontrollably.  When I finally woke up I felt fine.  I remembered reading that seizure was one of the possible side effects so it didn't alarm me too much.  I promised myself I wouldn't take that much at a time again.


     


Other side effects I experienced were constipation(severe constipation), inability to urinate, inability to reach orgasm, and occasional twitch here and there.  Be careful with this stuff
