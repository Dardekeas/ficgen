I've used Ecstacy several hundred times. This was over the course of 3 years or so. I feel that I'm very lucky to have continued to have good ecstacy trips for so long. Until last night, I had not used ecstacy in more than 3 years. I had originally lost interest in the substance because it seemed no longer to work. I would become VERY intoxicated, stimulated and experienced all of the perceptual shifts that MDMA brings, but no longer felt the `joy.' I tried ramping up my dosage, but to no positive effect. 



Last night, after a 3-year hiatus, I took 225-300 mg (hard to tell with street pills, I took 3.5 pills over 3 hours). I still did not have the `joy.' All the old `e-tricks' seemed to work and I was certainly nowhere near reality. Today I am feeling more positive than I remember in previous experiences. Usually, however, I don't get depressed until day 3 following the experience. 



I have heard much about the `loss of magic' experience, but have never read anything about this effect spanning years of nonuse. I must say, I'm extremely disappointed, but I also feel that I must have learned what I needed from the drug.
