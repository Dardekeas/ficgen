When I was in Peru this past January, I had the chance to chew coca leaves.  In my first experience, in Cusco city, I chewed approx. four leaves, with a bit of lime to help digestion.  Mostly it just tasted nasty, although there was some numbness in my cheek where I was holding the wad.  I felt slightly more cheerful/buzzed afterwards.  



The second time was in an outlying village at elevation.  I was having an *extremely* hard time breathing, and chewed about three or four leaves in hopes that it would open my lungs up a bit.  They helped *immensely*;  breathing was much easier and I was able to complete the hike.



In summation:  Not worth it, unless I'm  using it as the Quechua people would, to aid in breathing or as an appetite supressant.  I got a very, very mild high from it, and a nice, numb mouth.  The tea tastes wonderful, as well.
