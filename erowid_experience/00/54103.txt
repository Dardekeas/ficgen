Let me preface this report with some background information on myself. As a child, I was diagnosed with ADD and some developmental disorder. I was prescribed Ritalin when I was 7 or 8 and used it tell I was around 10.



The other day I acquired some Ritalin. Two pills, ten MG each. I went home, and insuffalated them. Then I took a shower. During my shower I felt the effects come on slowly. I felt happy, almost silly. When it kicked in I started beat boxing for a second haha. After that I got out, and went to my room and I sat down on my lazy boy chair. I felt happy and sociable. But one thing that I really didn't expect was, I didn't feel like it was a stimulant. I felt sleepy and lazy - relaxed and at peace. I even felt hungry. Really made me wonder. I felt a urge to socialize. I grabbed my phone and I called my friends and I said something along the lines of `Man I feel so good!'. After that I popped on my iPod and listened to some music and relaxed for a while. Sounded great. I even layed down for a bit and listened to music. 



The whole experience lasted around two hours in its entirety. During the come down, I felt a strong urge to do more (unfortunately I didn't have any more :( ) The night after I took it, and the day after, I experienced some eye twitching. It didn't happen often, like twice a hour. In general, I say I had a excellent time. I felt better than I have in months. I can't wait to do this again :)
