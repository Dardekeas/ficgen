This report focuses on how St. John's has helped my depression an unbelieveable amount, but if you don't really suffer from depression St. John's is a great calming drug just for the experience as well.  I occasionaly will given my roomate one, and he always mentions that he notices that he feels really good, extra-calm, and happy\ldots   I've taken two at a time for fun, and there's an especially nice happiness and relaxing sensation (I have not tried more than 2 at once).



After reading many online reports about St. John's, I kept contemplating back and forth about whether to try it or not\ldots   One day I had an issue come up that I knew would send me into a depression, so I knew it was time to give it a shot.  I bought a bottle of 300mg capsules from a local grocery store and just followed the directions on the bottle (which were to take one tablet 3 times daily). So I started with that and have been taking it faithfully (except for once) for about 4 months now.  



For as long as I can remember I've always felt isolated from the world and incredibly hesitant about things like talking to people I don't know or being in new situations.  With St. John's I feel much more at ease and less worried about most everything (what I imagine a `normal' person feels like).  Example: Before if I'd said something weird to someone (not mean or cruel, just something I looked back at and thought was weird), I would get mad and stay mad at myself for a long time for being `not normal' and be afraid of what they thought of me.  St. John's has calmed me down significantly and allowed me to finally actually relax.  



Looking back, I used to see everyday things as almost a hassle to have to go through and derived very little real enjoyment from them (classes, work, watch tv, etc.).  Now I do most of things I've always done, but I actually enjoy doing them significantly more.  I've had a noticeable difference not just in my personal feelings, but multiple people have said remarked on how I've become dramatically less worried/guarded and more friendly and talkative.



After about a month of taking it, I decided to stop for a few days and see if I could do without it (just because of the desire that I didn't want to be dependent on something).  In those days I became nervous about everything and twitchy like i'd always been before (well slightly worse, probably because I actually knew more of what it was like to feel normal as I hadn't before).  As I said, I used to get mad at myself for doing a simple weird thing, but unlucky for myself during these days I actually did do something pretty stupid.  Instead of the old `pissed off at myself' attitude, I felt totally and completely worthless, one of the worst days I've ever had mentally\ldots   After my failed experiment to see if I had been `cured', I swiftly went back to the suggested regimen and will be sticking to it for the forseeable future.



After taking a capsule, I would say the effects slowly fade in within 30 mins-1 hour or so, `peak' at 4 or so hours, and are starting to fade away by the sixth hour.  The directions on what I bought say 3 tablets daily, and that's a pretty accurate timing-wise.  I take one in the morning with breakfast, one at lunch, and one at dinner (and one later in the evening if I plan on staying up late)\ldots   I still feel a little depression: a slight bit some mornings before the St. John's has a chance to kick in, and random other ocassions like when i can't keep my schedule of taking it.  But these times aren't that horribly bad, as I know that within just a little while of taking it those feelings will fade away.



I really can't believe how I could have suffered from depression for years and a great help was sitting next to the Tylenol in the grocery store and cost about 10 cents per capsule.  There isn't a `cure' for depression in anything or anyone, but for me this has been an amazing way to help control and dramatically improve my everyday life.  If I had only have found this 4 or 5 years ago\ldots  but since I can't go back in time I'm just glad I discovered it when I did.
