A while back, when I first heard about Salvia Divinorum, I purchased a sample package from an online company, which contained a nice selection of different varieties of their herbal products, including the salvia 20x (woah!), a couple different herbal smoking blends, blue lotus, some nice yopo seeds (which after a few absolutley mind blowing salvia trips, I'm now a little more open to trying that special little lady), as well as a few grams of wild dagga, and wild dagga flowers. Up until now, I haven't smoked much more than the salvia \& the blends, and have been putting the wild dagga off. I recently started reading a little more on our friends dagga, and it sounded like it wouldn't put me on my ass too hard, so last night I gave it a try.



I ground up the leafs in my mortar \& pestle (just preference, I like the stone on stone feeling as opposed to the electric grinders). I then packed a nice little wooden bowl that I bought for my `legal' herbs, which is roughly about enough for 6-7 pulls, and then on top of that, I placed 3 of the choicest flowers from the bag.



The smoke itself was slightly harsh, but bearable. Not unpleasent tasting, but I suggest mixing it with some other of your favorite smoking herb, just to cut the slight roughness in the throat. It did produce from me a little more phlegm and saliva, but nothing too bad.



The feeling I got from it was that of very mild marijuana buzz. No insightful musings or anything psychadelic, just a calmed, relaxed, mellow state of being. This lasted for about 20 minutes or so, until I went to sleep. Now, this is where dagga really worked her magick.



So, I had a pretty deep sleep, and I had one 2-part dream, that I can remember, just before the damn alarm went off. now, lately I haven't been remembering my dreams. I used to have very vivid dreamscapes, mostly when I was smoking ALOT of weed, and experimenting with psychadelics, meditation, yoga, astral projection and all that WONDERFUL stuff. I have been a fool as of the last few years, and have been really slacking on that part, but as of late, I haven't been able to recall any very vivid dreams. This is how the dream went.



It started, from what I can recall, with me walking down a street, until I came to a river embankment, which for some reason had a station for a sky tram that went over the river, which was surrounded by a small Egyptian themed amusement park/museum of sorts, with all manner of pyramids, obelisks, and a great statue of Anubis. So, I get on the tram, and travel over the river, and when I get off, I meet a small African boy, who is pushing a wooden cart. He tells me that he needs to go see his uncle, to bring him something. I go with him through the jungle, and in this cart he is pushing is about an inch or two of some dark looking liquid.



So, we get to a clearing and his uncle is there waiting for us. He comes over, and produces a cup, which he dips into the dark liquid, and then pours it right back in the cart. Apparently this is all the boy needed to do, because he turns and start walking back. I follow, and then turn around to see the rest of the tribe surrounding the uncle, and they are all waving their arms to come back, but the boy doesn't turn around. We get to a shoreline, and there is a giant wooden boat/storefront, almost like a walk up window at a fast food place. A white woman comes outside the boat with a cart of her own, which has some bottles containing dark fluid that resembles the liquid in the cart. The bottles are labeled like soda bottles, and the name on them is either Tahi or Tathi. She then tells me that I am not ready for this and turns to go back in the boat, and then I wake up.



Well, my interpretation of the dream is that the fluid represents the dagga, which can possibly be made into a tea. Now the white woman telling me that I'm not ready, just means that she is a representation of our European overlords, who don't want us to find out our true nature as gods in human form. Now, before you get all antsy, I'm white, but I know the deal. We all came originally from Africa, but somewhere along the line, the Europeans took over the entire globe, and now we can't get legal weed, but I digress. Anyways, the dark fluid can also represent the dark matter of the universe, or melanin, the pineal gland/third eye, which is in all of us, and is the key to unlocking our minds and finding the potential for our spirits to ascend and seek out or souls.



Well, in summary, Wild Dagga is a good herb to smoke for relaxation, as well as a tool to go into deep REM sleep and take a journey to your subconcious mind. I highly reccomend it, and am going to be buying an ounce soon, so I can make some of that special `dark matter tea', explore the effects, and I report on it when I do. Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have much fun on your explorations. Namaste and Ashay!
