I was Initially diagnosed with Idiopathic Angioedema at aged 16. Which means that for many reasons or no reasons at all, at anytime the deep tissue in my body can swell through fluid build up. Originally it used to only effect my lips, eyes, feet and hands but rapidly progressed to mouth, tongue and throat more frequently. 

The only solution given was prednisone. 2 x 20mg daily for 3 days after the initial attack. 



This review is based on only 1 days dose of 2x20mg. (not the full 3 days)



Over those 7 years I have noticed with each dose, massivly increased iritability and mood swings within 24 hours of taking it. As well as both constipation for 12 - 14 hours followed by fiendishly painful diarrhea lasting from 30mins to an hour.



On top of this I find for the 24 - 48 hours after the initial dose I suffer from depression in varying scales, becoming run down, lethargic and tired as well as becoming much more sucepptable to any colds/flus general bugs that I come into contact with.



All in all a fairly awful thing to be taking. But at least it calms down the Angioedema meaning my airways dont close. So pretty much worth it.
