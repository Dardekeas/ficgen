 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



I'll just give you a quick description of myself before I get into anything. I was a freshman in high school at the time of this experience. Now I'm 15 and about to be a sophomore. I have a history of fairly heavy drug use. I've done hydrocodone, shrooms, morphine, codeine, promethazine, oxycodone, nitrous, keyboard duster, DXM, benadryl, valium, xanax, Ritalin, adderall, nutmeg, tobacco, inhaled gasoline, weed, and obviously alcohol.



This was probably the most regretted and miserable drug experience I have ever had. As I describe to you what happened you will understand why. It gave me a new respect for alcohol and taught me to only drink responsibly because if you are reckless it can lead to some harsh consequences.



It all started on a Friday afternoon when my parents picked me up after school to take me over to my grandmother's house to stay for the weekend because they were going to be out of town. I was pretty excited about this because the last time I had been there I noticed she had a nicely stocked liquor cabinet in her living room that was left over from my grandfather's drinking years (he was quite the alcoholic). When I got to my grandmother's house, I said goodbye to my parents and sat down to watch some television with my cousin, who lives with my grandma because she is going to college in the community. I just wasted time all evening until they both went to bed and then I busted out the vodka. This was the first of two nights of heavy drinking, and this one wasn't bad at all. I did about 15 shots and was fairly drunk but nothing uncontrollable.



It was the second night that I got WAY too drunk. After my grandma and my cousin went to bed, I went and grabbed the 80 proof vodka and the shot glass. I went into the bathroom and poured myself about 8 shots in about 20 or thirty minutes. By this point I wasn't horribly impaired, however I was being affected. I got on the computer, signed onto my instant messenger, and began talking to several of my friends. I stayed there for around 25 minutes and then told my friends I was going to do some more shots. I went into the bathroom and took about 6 more. I walked out into the computer room and sat down in the chair. Then again, I decided to go drink some more. I was already pretty drunk and wasn't at all concerned about getting too much because I hadn't ever thought about it before. 



This time I didn't go to the bathroom. I went back to the liquor cabinet and grabbed a bottle of amaretto and took a few big swigs of it before I put it back. I spilled a whole lot of this shit on my shirt, which will later result in some pretty shameful events. Then I walked back into the bathroom and took about 6 more shots. I did this in about an hour, so by the time I stumbled out of the bathroom I was completely wasted. However, I could still function. I went and got back on the computer and started talking again. I was saying all kinds of stupid shit to everyone and laughing at it for about 30 minutes until I made a HUGE mistake. I went back in the bathroom. I hadn't planned on drinking anymore because I knew I was already probably pushing it, but when I walked into the bathroom I saw the bottle and thought, why the hell not? After I did 3 more shots I started looking in the mirror and making faces. I began to laugh hysterically. Then I noticed some brown shit all over my shirt and remembered I had spilled some amaretto on myself. I decided to get in the shower and get cleaned up.



I took off my clothes and got in, only to realize I still had my socks on. They were soaked so I took them off and put them on the floor by the shower. This is the last thing I remember. The next thing I knew I was waking up in my bed, ass naked with a KILLER hangover. This is the only hangover I've ever had and I've been drunk quite a few times, so I found this to be agonizing. I had blacked out before I could put any of the alcohol up. So even though I was in hell from my hangover I had to get up and put the vodka and shot glass away before anyone else woke up. Then in the bathroom I saw that I had thrown up all over the toilet. It seemed like an eternity until I was finished wiping up my puke. I knew I just wanted to die because I was feeling so goddamn miserable and ashamed. 



This hangover lasted all day until about 5 pm. It was easily one of the worst days of my life. I probably threw up 15 times and couldn't even eat lunch. When my mom came and got me, I got extremely sick in the car and puked out the door. I told my mom I must be carsick because I slept through lunch and hadn't eaten all day. She took me to a gas station and bought some pepto bismol tablets, after unsuccessfully trying to get me to eat. The medicine helped me to keep from getting too sick on the hour long ride home, but I still felt like absolute shit, physically and emotionally. I was horribly ashamed of myself. 



When we got home I took a cold shower (the cold seemed to soothe the hangover for some reason) and lay down to watch some television. We got home at around 2:30 pm, so I still felt like shit until around 5. After the hangover diminished, I just felt exhausted for the remainder of the day. That night I went to bed at around 11 pm and slept straight through the night without waking up even once. 



The next day, I was still ashamed of how I had let it get out of hand, but I also knew that I had gained a new wisdom about alcohol abuse. It can be a great thing, but if I get carried away it can also be an awful time.
