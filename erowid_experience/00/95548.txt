Well, I went clubbing this weekend and took a nice cocktail. Let me describe my Saturday evening. I had my pipe with me and smoked a bowl every now and then when I felt like it. I have a history with lots of Shrooms and LSD, 4-AcO-DMT, some n,n-DMT and 4-HO-MET, 2C-C and 2C-P (one time 2C-B and 2C-E), DOB, LSA and several amphetamines and cathinones. My mood was weekendy.



At about 10pm I took 80mg of nice clean, nearly clear MDMA and went to the Plux, a local Techno party in Hamburg. Barely anyone was there and the music was nice but kinda slow paced so I went home again to do a little DJing myself. After 1 or 2 hours I went back and redosed an unknown amount, not to much, maybe 50mg. I think later I redosed again, can't really remember. Most of the time the music was to slow for me and I got bored, and I decided to drop 2 blotters with supposedly 125ug of LSD each. Can't really remember when and how either. Right when the come-up got really noticeable Framework began with their set and the pace of the music changed, now they played real techno! The lighting was rather dark and there was lots of fog. Awesome experience, but not what this report is about. After their set a local live act started and I got bored again, so I went home with my flatmates and a friend and we ate some breakfast. This was at about 11am. At 1pm or 2pm two of my three friends were asleep and I decided to resume raving. I took 120mg of 6-APB and went through a park in the rain to a `friendlier' party with slower, not so dark techno and tech-house. The 6-APB came on nice and gentle and the first one or two hours there were mostly stoned dancing. Then a friend arrived and had 1g of Ketamine with him, which we took with another friend over the course of the next 5 hours. And here it got really weird. The first dose was a rather big one, if not the biggest, it stung in my nose and made my eyes water. After a few minutes I got the typical alcohol-like mood and gloomy optics, but my movement wasn't really impaired which I account to the 6-APB. Also, normally when the K fades I get tired, but not this time. After the second hit, my time axis got fucked up. Music and movement seemed slower, but my thoughts ran at normal pace. Maybe my thoughts ran at double speed. The music felt like 60 or 70BPM, and I danced at that pace, while I knew it was at about 120-125BPM. I could understand my 2 K buddies, but other people spoke too fast to understand. My vision was kinda dark but crystal-clear, not strobing like most times but it seemed as if parts were missing, like as if my brain just would process some pieces with highest precision and some were left out. There was no fog machine, only people smoking but every ray of light got a semi-massive beam, every colour got so intense. Every time the K faded, some aspects of time-perception, vision and hearing seemed to synchronize and the music and movement became faster. Sometimes I could slow it down again if I watched somewhere else, and back. Everything slowed down with every redose and every smoked bowl. I wonder if I could have brought everything to a near full stop\ldots and when I would have blacked out.
