I was on Paxil for almost 2 years. Unlike some others, I had very few issues while I was on it. The timed-release capsules are definitely better than the regular dose. It releases slowly, and doesn't give me the ups-and-downs throughout the day.



Then I tried to get off of paxil. I tapered off, like I was supposed to, until I was on 10mg every day (down from 20mg). Then I tried to go to 10mg every other day, and started having the normal withdrawals that have been reported: dizziness, most of all.



I talked to my doctor, whom I respect very much, but I guess a guy can't know everything and has to rely on the marketing department of whoever produces Paxil. So he told me there wasn't much to be done and that I had to go cold-turkey, since I was already at the lowest dose (going to 5mg every day hadn't ocurred to me).



So I went cold-turkey, and it was the worst 10 days in a very long time. The dizziness was out of control. Since I don't own a car, and get around for the most part by motorcycle, I was effectively under house arrest. I could hear my eyes (some people say they hear whoosing in their head\ldots  I heard that, but only when I moved my eyes). I got extremely irritable, to the point of getting into huge fights over trivial stuff with my wife.



My doctor, on my second visit told me that he'd seen another patient shortly after seeing me the last time, who reported having tried to get off of paxil for *2 years*. So in hindsight I feel lucky, but will definitely try not to be on paxil ever again, if I can avoid it. Getting off of it is a bitch!
