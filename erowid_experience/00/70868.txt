I prepared for this experience by first brewing some damiana and passionflower tea, followed by a very small (30mg) dose of codeine and a small cup of californian poppy tea. As of late I have been suffering worse than usual from clinical depression and anxiety, and have ceased my reasonably heavy 3yr cannabis habit. Thus, I wanted to be in a comfortable place before my experience. 



I smoked the mix in a dark room, with incense burning and a ring of candles around me and my close friend. I felt an initial rush of anxiety as the smoke entered my lungs followed by a pronounced sense of calm. I was seeking to find out what has been plaguing my mind, as I have for a long time had the theory that alot of my personality disorder(s) is attributed to a repressed memory of some sort, as I have had problems before I experimented with any drugs. Anyway, I closed my eyes and then felt a feeling of intense heat, and saw brightness, much the same as if u shine a bright light on your eyelids when ur eyes are closed, but in this case the closest thing that resembled it was flames of a fire. I was back in my childhood and my mind was clear - not the fragmented collaboration it is today. I felt intense love and belonging, as if I was in the arms of my mother, the type of love I feel and associate with family. I then had a vision of a man, someone who closely resembled my father, but looked like he had looked before I was born. He was laughing and seemed to be very joyous. 



At this stage I opened my eyes and experienced intense euphoria (and permi-smile :P) and experienced love towards my friend not unlike that of a heavy dose of MDMA. I saw shapes, but triangles for some reason came to mind and making a triangle with my fingers seemed to be the thing to do :S. This first time was for me to be able to let go and embrace the effects of this psychedelic. I have had some experiences with a few psychedelics but as mentioned before, was not sure if I would react positively in a fragile state. My state of mind continued to be altered, minor visual hallucinations for about 30 mins afterwards. The second time I smoked it, about 1 1/2 hrs later, I was in my friends room with another close friend nearby. I smoked one full cone and immediately sat back and closed my eyes. I had a birds-eye-view of a being (human, but not sure of the gender) walking through the Australian bush but also at the same time the smell and organic `feel' one gets from being in it in first person. The being ran and came to a cliff edge that broke away into a lake of water, that was completely contained but overlooked a mountain range. `I' dove in (a weird sense of being in third person and first person at the same time) and experienced a rush of cleansing calm through my body and took two huge breaths. 



I swam down to the bottom, through relatively cloudy water and viewed the rock formations that were underneath the water; an organic, grounding feeling. I then opened my eyes and again felt intense euphoria. I was drawn to my palms where I again visualised triangles and felt compelled to poke triangles into them with my fingers. I also felt compelled to study my friends palms, an urging sense to grab them and just feel (unfortunately I didnt). Particularly stimulating was putting slight pressure in the dead-centre of my palm with my index finger. I awoke to a sense of calm and continued to be fascinated my mild visual hallucinations. I'm not sure what my visions meant, but I'm sure they meant something. I would love to learn more about interpreting these events. 



Overall I think that this herb or collection of plants and herbs containing DMT can be very useful but I recognise that it is most useful in answering questions; it seems to tap into the unconcious - dreamtime is a perfect name for this particular mix. It is the next day as I am writing this and I felt pretty out-of-it through the day, with a bit of a headache. Nonetheless, uni was fascinating! I took a couple of nurofens and feel much better. Another thing I noticed was it made me extremely dehydrated. I diddnt really notice but when I finally had a drink of water I drank heaps. I hope this explanation of my personal experience, although brief, aids you in your spiritual journeys. I plan to experiment more with the substance later on, but I achieved my purpose in trying it- it gave a positive sense of the things to come. 



[Reported dose: `Less than 1 cone of a medium sized conepiece / Then 1 full cone']
