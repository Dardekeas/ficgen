I've been using tramadol about twice a week - a 200mg dose (4x50mg brand name Ultram). I start with the 200mg and 350mg carisoprodol, then I take another 350mg carisoprodol (Watson brand) every couple hours. So the total does ends up being 200mg tramadol and 1400mg carisoprodol. I can keep a good feeling going for about 8 to 12 hours doing this. I would say 200mg tramadol with the carisoprodol booster is equivalent to about 20mg hydrocodone. I've tried mixing tramadol and hydro (I've heard other who rave about it) but they seemed to get in each others way (maybe the tramadol occupies the opiate receptors and prevents the hydro from fully manifesting its effect).



I've also added 1mg alprazolam (Xanax) at the end to sleep but have quit the alprazolam completely now (not a big fan of that drug). Another drug that mixes well with tramadol is tianeptine (Stablon). This is probably my favorite drug. To me, it's an authentic `happy pill'. They look like candy - they're even sugar coated! Servier has some crazy marketing ideas, I guess they want it to be appealing to the kiddies. After I take about 25 - 50 mg of tianeptine I get a real happy, positive, good to be alive feeling (maybe euphoria) that lasts for an hour or two. I never notice it crashing - so it must drift away slowly. I've never noticed anything close to a hangover with tianeptine. It has a very subtle effect, the first time I took it I thought it did nothing. It seems like you have to take it few times before your brain figures out how to use it (like weed). I do this with tramadol every once in awhile but usually by itself or with gabapentin (Neurontin).



While I can mix tianeptine with either gabapentin or tramadol I have had bad luck mixing gabapentin with tramadol. Again it seems like there are some canceling of effects going on. Or I just get nauseated. So I usually take gabapentin by itself, 1200mg with a meal then every couple hours another 1200mg with food (foods help bioavailability of gabapentin). The max per day would be 3600mg. This drug stones me and makes me completely uninhibited. It makes me enjoy public places much more.



I've been going all this for about 6 months, trying not to overdo it. The tramadol causes a little constipation but I started eating all bran cereal for breakfast which has fixed that.
