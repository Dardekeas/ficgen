Bored in a college town my roommates and I decided to explore further into the world of Over the Counter (otc) drugs for recreational use. While thumbing through the different options we decided upon Benadryl (diphenhydramine) in 50mg Softgels, Sleepinal brand. So without further introduction, here goes our evening. We're going to list the time and dosage of any substances used; in a journal format. This will be the amended journal entry as I became too intoxicated to type; I used a notebook and a marker to jot down my thoughts, starting at 1:00a.m. (zero hour).





- 0:00 - 300 mg diphenhydramine orally ingested, 50 mg liquid form that we squeezed from the softgel onto a hand rolled cigarette, we proceeded to smoke it followed by an unmodified cigarette.

Mindset/Physical Alteration: No real feelings noticed yet, a slight drowsy `stoned' feeling. It's pretty pleasant and we're watching the science channel which is showing a documentary on inverted perception and how astronauts have issues learning how to navigate in a zero gravity or inverted environment. It's pretty interesting.



- 0:32 - 1 Bowl Hydroponic Cannabis smoked through a virgin dry hammer. 

Mindset/Physical Alteration: A very heavy body buzz and the stone seems almost to be intensified. I don't know if this is just my imagination or what.



- 0:58 -- 4 more 50mg diphenhydramine liquidgels.

Mindset/Physical Alteration: I'm starting to feel the effects of the diphenhydramine coursing through my veins. With a total of 350 mg (300 orally, 50 combusted/inhaled) ingested so far, I feel this can only get more fun! We're watching Futurama and I'm starting to get play off of some tapestries that we have hung from the ceiling and the wall. My live plans also seem to offer a lot of eye candy to look at. My mind seems to weigh more than usual, my eyelids close slower, my heart rate has remained about the same, and the effects of nausea are none. So far this is proving to be an interesting experience. My computer screen seems to have an unusual glow about it as I type. My ability to hear things seems to have gone up considerably. 



- 1:22 -- No additional ingestion of diphenhydramine.

Mindset/Physical Alteration: I'm beginning to feel the effects of the diphenhydramine very strongly.  My mind has almost a constant buzz and my awareness is heightened but I'm still very chill. We're now watching Matrix: Reloded, I'm very overcome by this feeling; I'm going to watch part of the movie and come back later.



- 2:44 -- Nothing new ingested.

Mindset/Physical Alteration: My mind has now decided to fixate on things that look like heat squiggles, but over every texture that I see. It can be on walls, the ceiling; the floor\ldots.everything has a moving squiggle pattern. My eyes have become heavy with sleepy feelings. This most unimpressive side effect of the diphenhydramine is the drowsiness. If it weren't for my body fighting me to go to sleep, this would be an amazing experience.



- 4:39 -- 3 25mg diphenhydramine tablets orally ingested.

Mindset/Physical Alteration: I tried to take a shower a little bit ago; it was amazingly\ldotsdifferent\ldotsthan any other shower I've ever taken. It seems that I can feel each and every droplet that hits me. My shower curtain which has a pattern of 3D bubbles covering it entirely has began to sway in the non-existent wind\ldotsI find myself spacing out frequently and forgetting that I was in the shower. My mind continues to make pictures of familiar things from the bubble patter on the curtain. I don't know how long each session of spacing out lasted, but it's amazing how much of a hold the diphenhydramine has on my mind.



- 5:00 -- 3 25mg diphenhydramine tablets orally ingested

Mindset/Physical Alteration: My level of diphenhydramine ingested now totals 700+mg. With a suggested dose of just 25-50mg this is certainly what it must feel like to have an overdose. I'm feeling my body slow down, and I'm almost noticing a quiet coming over my body. I am starting to wonder if this is what it's like to die. I'm lying in my bed and my left leg is now no longer under my control, my breathing has become very shallow, my heart rate has slowed considerably. I try to get up out of bed to stretch out my legs, but to no avail. I fall over in almost a drunken stupor. I can no longer function, now had I had a baby sitter at this point they would be calling an ambulance I fear. I'm in rough shape.



Hopefully soon I can fall asleep, one of the most confusing aspects about what's occurring is that I'm so tired yet my body almost knows there is something going on and it won't allow me to fall asleep like a defense mechanism. The feelings in my head are now becoming even stronger; my head is spinning on an opposite axis from my body. I feel as if I'm on a carnival ride, or perhaps a gyroscope ride. I'm ready for the feelings to subside so I can go to sleep, but that doesn't look like it's going to happen for quite some time.



- 6:00 -- No new substance.

Mindset/Physical Alteration: I'm to the climax of my experience I think. My whole body is now engulfed by the feeling of heavy weightlessness. Meaning that my extremities are easy to move but they feel very heavy when they are motionless. I keep trying to stretch out the muscle in my left leg but my body is confused when I do so. My brain gets the messages from my nerves and allows me to feel similar but not accurate sensations. When sitting in the lotus position I feel as if my legs have braided together, as I sit on the floor a trail of unidentifiable insects make a bold strike against the carpet. Unable to evade the imaginary creatures, I sit and just admire as my body rolls back and forth at its own will. I'm either steps away from death, or am close to coming around.

- 13:00 -- No new substances

Mindset/Physical Alteration: I woke up at 1 p.m. the following day, surprisingly no real hangover effects. I had to defecate terribly badly, but this could be blamed on the pizza for dinner previously. I feel a little groggy, as I should after ingesting well over the recommended dosage. I guess I'm good to start my day, diphenhydramine proved to be really fun after all!



***********************Conclusion/Final Thoughts**************************



Conclusion: After some careful thinking and reflecting I've decided that I'll probably never do this again. I do not however regret the fact that I did it. I feel as if I came pretty close to overdosing (od), I do wish that I would have pre-loaded for this activity to prevent the drowsy feelings as well as maybe to prevent a small amount of cottonmouth. Also, a way to counter act the muscle spasms would be a great find.



Totals:



-	700mg diphenhydramine (550mg softgel/150tablet)

-	3 12oz cans of Bud Light.

-	4 Parliament Lights

-	.75g of Hydroponic Cannabis

-	Total Cost:

o	\$ 11.00 (USD)
