This, is fucking insane.



I was walking to my first class at community college, and I spotted a half of a joint in the grass.  I hadn't smoked any weed for a month, so I interpreted this as some sort of sign that it was OK for me to break my weed fast just this once.  Well after class me and my friend `Y' went to meet her boyfriend.  He picked us up and we smoked the joint, which tasted funny, in his car.  I began to feel fucked up very fast, wow I thought, my tolerance has gone WAY down, then a little bit too fucked up.  My whole mouth and face felt numb.  I felt like yelling, and we both were laughing about how weird we felt.  Well at this point they dropped me off at my car because they had to leave and I still had another class in an hour.  So I'm at my car, alone, totally twacked out of my head.  



I drive to my friends house which is down the street from school.  I can only look straight forward, looking left or right while moving forwards confuses the hell out of me.  Out of some miracle I make it to my friends house.  Walking up to his door I feel like I am walking incredibly strange, my movements are jerky and I feel like my body is really blocky and compressed.  I walk into his house and I start yelling his name, he isn't home.  I feel light headed, like I am about to pass out, and my whole body is numbed out (kind of like nitrous I suppose).  I call my other friend who lives on the same street a few blocks down.  I told him to come over because I think I just smoked PCP and I didn't know what the hell was going on.  



I made some green tea.  My movements are jerky and sporadic and I spill water all over the stove as I slam the pot down.  I put on Fatboy Slim because I wanted to hear what music sounded like in this state.  It wasn't that great, it didn't seem to make much sense to me.  I danced around a little bit to the music.  I felt like I was floating around and being pressed down on at the same time, gravity was totally distorted.   The beat of the song sounded like it kept slowing down and speeding up.  I pour my tea, and try to drink it.  



I notice my heart is beating really fast.  I become a little paranoid and call my friend again and tell him I'm going to walk down the street and meet him half way.  I walk outside with the tea cup, spilling tea all over my hand as I walk.  I notice people outside, and I am paranoid that they know I am fucked up.  I feel like I am walking crazily, I have to concentrate really hard to feel like I am walking normally.  I clench my fist, it feels like a bunch of blocks.  



My whole body feels incredibly strange, like a big moving abstract sculpture, I am totally disoriented.  I try as hard as I can to look normal.  I feel like I am walking really slowly, getting nowhere.  again if I look to the side when I'm moving forward I get extremely disoriented. I think about how I want to hug my friend when I see him.  All of the sudden I see a mass of grey and black squares, it seems stationary, I can't tell if it's getting closer or moving farther away.  It's my friend, and when I see him I tell him thanks for meeting me.  He has a boombox with him.  He tries to tell me some story but I can't make much sense of what he is saying.  



I tell him over and over that nothing makes any sense and I don't know what the hell is happening.  We walked back to our friend's house, went in and watched tv.  I told my friend to page `Y' to see if they are ok.  They call back and he tells them I am going absolutely insane.  Then went to school so I could at least sign in to my class. Overall the effects lasted about 3 and a half hours.  Definately one of the craziest experiences of my entire life, as I had never smoked PCP or done any dissociatives before.  The experience definitely wasn't pleasant but I can't say it wasn't interesting and fun in a strange way.  Now I can know what those guys on Cops are feeling when they're running around shirtless speaking paranoid jibberish.
