Part of my life being a troubled teenager involved experimenting with many substances, it also included depression mixed in with some anxiety and insomnia. I was on a 100mg dosage of Luvox (some SSRI) and I was prescribed Stilnox to help me sleep. 



I'd only used stilnox a few times before and noticed weird things like feeling the presence of people, but these particularly weird things experianced stopped after a few times. This is the experiance that was most memorable for me\ldots 



It was a night were a good sleep was desirable because I was planning to go for a run along the beach at 5:30 am the next morning. I knew I wasn't going to be able to sleep, so despite doctors advice I took one tablet (10mg) around 11:30 and went straight to bed, falling asleep when the drug took effect, which is odd because I usually stay up and be fucked up for a few hours while talking to friends on the phone.



I awoke at 5:30 because of my alarm and  I got up without thinking, which is even stranger because I usually just lay there or fall asleep. I got my running shoes on and went for a run. Whilst running along the beach I felt that I was with different friends at different times and I actually recall talking to one of them at one stage and being disappointed when there was no reply, making me wonder who I was talking to. After a while of doing that, I got home rather exhausted but still not having a clue what was going on. Because I had taken the pill the night before I had forgotten about taking it, I had no idea that I was under the influence of anything. I may have taken a shower, but the only thing I really remember after the beach was falling asleep on my friend several times on the school bus. By the time I got to school I was no longer intoxicated by the drugs effect and realised that I had been messed up the whole time. I had not been able to draw that conclusion untill I was straight.



Overall it is a weird drug, that I'm not so sure if I enjoy anymore (due to an experiance I regret involving a female friend) but I do urge anyone who is interested to give it a try. It is an interesting drug to experiment with but I personally don't like it as a sleeping aid, infact the only drug I like as a sleeping aid is good old marijuana :)!!!



Peace\ldots
