I was bored one day and I decided to take a trip down to the local garden center with my friend (lets call him Alex) in search of heavenly blue seeds. I had looked in vain on a few other occasions, but this time I got lucky. I picked up four packets (10 grams for \$7.80, not a bad deal!). Afterwards I went to have dinner with my dad for his birthday. I think this was my first mistake.



I ate a huge amount of steak and a lot of soda. On retrospect I wonder if the caffeine I consumed had anything to do with the intensity of the experience to come. After dinner I went home and (after washing carefully with soap and mineral water) ate half of the 240 seeds I had counted out. I took a shower, consumed the other half, put on some Tool, and sat down to wait. 



After about half an hour I began to feel very very different. My walls began to pulsate along with the music. Ordinary everyday things became very different and interesting, it's very difficult to explain. I was looking at a pencil, and my brain registered that it was a pencil, but it just didn't seem like a pencil. I decided to put on my black light to make things more trippy. It seemed like an eternity had passed (although it was really only about two minutes) when I began to feel extremely sick to my stomach. Everything that passed my vision began to blur and leave strange colorful trails. I began to see the psychedelic patterns that I've seen so many times under the influence of mushrooms and nutmeg. I curled up in a fetal position on my bed and stared at the ceiling. Suddenly the nausea hit me again in a huge wave, and I grabbed my trash can and vomited into it about six times.



Afterwards I felt better, until I realized that the trash can I had vomited into had been my wicker hamper, and was leaking foul smelling juice all over my bed. I started to feel extremely guilty, and I somehow knew that once my parents saw that I had puked they would know I had done drugs. I started crying, but the tears felt really strange, kind of like syrup running down my face. I looked over at my wall and saw a huge vision of someone mooning me through one of my posters. This made me cry even more, it seemed to me that the seeds were making fun of me. I turned off my black light and immediately started to wonder why there wasn't any more blue light in my room. It confused me.



Soon I began to feel very suicidal, and tried to go to the kitchen to find a knife. The part of my brain that was still normal stopped me just in time, and informed me that I would feel much better if I cleaned up my room. So, I emptied my hamper into a bag and wandered outside to hide it. (actually lurched would have been a better description, I could barely bend my knees because of horrible leg cramps). That was when things started getting really interesting. One time when I was extremely high my friend had made a joke about dead people in cars. The memory came back to me just then, and suddenly my brain screamed at me ``oh my god, there's dead people in the cars''! This freaked me out, and I ran as fast as I could back to my house, leaving the trash bag in front of some ones carport. As I ran I began to see dark shapes behind the steering wheels of every parked car I passed. Finally when I was almost home I passed a dark alley next to my neighbors house, and I saw death standing there waiting for me. I almost pissed myself from fear.



When I was safely back inside the panic eased away, and I was left feeling good. I didn't have to worry about cleaning my room anymore, so I was free to relax and enjoy the trip.  Every time I opened my eyes and stared at something I felt a neuron in my brain explode. It was an invigorating, stimulating feeling. I began to experiment with my mind. I would close my eyes and imagine a shark lunging at me, and suddenly I would get an adrenaline rush as if it was actually happening. I fell asleep a few hours later, after having a very nice fantasy about mounting an attractive angel and fucking her.



During the trip I felt like there was nothing I would rather be than normal, but now that I look back on it it was pretty entertaining. I plan to try again later when my parents aren't home. It might help with the fear and guilt I experienced.
