This experience happened just last weekend and because there are so few reports of 3-MeO-PCP on here I thought it would be a good idea to let everyone know what I experienced.  I was with my buddy M and we happened to run into a mutual friend of ours, B, at the mall. We decided to hangout together and do some drugs considering we haven't all been together in a while and B had some 25i-nbome and some 3-MeO-PCP he wanted us to try. M and myself had both done 25i-nbome on a few occasions and considering we are both some suckers for dissociatives, we decided to try the latter.  

Let me start by saying I have done A LOT of DXM and ketamine so I have a pretty high tolerance to nmda antagonists so I felt comfortable doing a relatively high dose. I insufflated 10 mgs and waited for onset about 45 minutes, at which point I took another 10mgs nasally. After about 2 hours I was barely high and it just felt like a light ketamine buzz and made walking feel pretty strange but other than that I felt very normal.

Then about a half hour later I started to get a headache, which over the course of the next hour, evolved into such a massive burden I could literally do nothing but lie down and wait for it to pass. It felt as if my brain was bleeding all over internally, and as if my eyes were swollen so badly I could barely see anything. I could only lay in darkness and hope that it would end shortly. 

After about 5 more hours of this I finally managed to get to sleep and I woke up the next day with no headache or any negative effects from the previous night. All in all I was quite shocked at the reaction my body had to a class of chemical I thought it was quite familiar with.  I've never had a reaction like this before with any other dissociative or any other chemical at all for that matter.  

I thought that perhaps it was the batch I ingested that resulted in the negative effects but B, and M both said they had an amazing time so I've concluded it was just my body chemistry. Strange happenings.
