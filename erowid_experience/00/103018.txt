I'm experienced with most psychedelics, and 3C-E recently made it's way into the RC market, so I just couldn't resist giving it a try.



T+0:00: 50mg capsule swallowed.



T+0:25: Maybe something.



T+0:40: Stomach discomfort, light OEVs.



T+1:40: Subtle euphoria, discomfort mostly gone, visuals comparable to $\sim$20mg 2C-E, feeling amphed up, very stimmy, dry mouth, not much music enhancement though.



T+1:50: Just gotten a little stronger, visual and euphoria wise, also a wave of warmth.



T+2:05: Friendly vibe, feels like getting a massage (Shulgin would say it's quite erotic).



T+2:15: Music enhancement not as great as with the 2C series, still decent, listening to some nice tech-psy-trance.



T+2:30: Vivid CEVs, mostly red and very detailed `spires'.



T+3:40: Visuals still strong, enjoyable, feeling social, listening to the rather mediocre UMF trance stage.



T+4:50: Coming down a little, I think, visuals declining, lots of energy left, probably going for a smoke and some food in a bit.



T+5:30: Pretty much no visuals anymore, smoking a small bowl of AB-FUBINACA in hope of bringing the trip back.



T+5:40: Visuals are done for today. I'm having a small meal.



T+5:50: Smoking cannabis on the comedown of psychedelics is always great, same goes for AB-FUBINACA.



T+6:05: Feeling more stoned than tripping by now, however it's still quite stimulating.



T+6:50: A little tired, but feeling great, enjoyable comedown.





Stimulant effects lasted another few hours, fell asleep at around T+13:00.





Summary: Feels like a extremely visual stimulant. Not much psychedelic headspace otherwise. Very easy going, had a huge confident boost that probably lies in the amphetamine nature of this compound. Very social and chatty. During the peak there were some empathogenic effects. Stomach discomfort during the come up, faded quickly though. Visuals disappeared after roughly 6 hours.



Will definitely try again with a slightly higher dose (around 60-70mg). Might also be great in combination with a benzofuran.
