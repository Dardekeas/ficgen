First off, lemme describe myself and my state of mind during the experience. I'm a semi-healthy 19 year old male; highly intelligent in a very abstract, logical way. I've been intoxicated on a plethora of substances, controlled and uncontrolled ranging from mushies to coke to opiates to amphetamines.. etc.. the list continues\ldots  I am a daily cannabis and tobacco smoker, and have been for about a year prior to this experience.



I have been on Lexapro 10mg/day for about 3-4 weeks prior to this experience, which shaped my reaction to it.



First and foremost, the ecstasy experience was not `magical' or anything like that, it was very mild. I felt minor euphoria, had minor visual activity (shifting in patterns, morphing of textures) and very little mental activity. Hell, because of the SSRI state of mind, which I'd describe as `anti-depressed' (not happy but not depressed, a limbo state with minimal emotions), the ecstasy experience was far below stellar. This was my only time rolling, but my friends I was with were having a great time whereas I was only slightly off baseline. And within 5-6 hours after dosing I felt `normal' in all regards. I get more of an effect from cocaine or `uppers' in general.



Sadly, this reaction was expected. From what I understand of the literature, SSRIs work by essentially saturating your system with serotonin, none of it gets reabsorbed by the neurons - it just floats around in the intersynaptic gap. MDMA, on the other hand, causes a large rush of serotonin. SSRIs will essentially `normalize' this serotonin explosion, thereby attenuating all the reported amazing effects of MDMA. Like I said above, it felt a little bit speedy with a *very* slight twinge of psychedelia. Nothing to write home about.



So, bottom line, SSRI + MDMA = reduced experience. No great empathogenic breakthroughs or any good shit like that, just minor speedy effects really.
