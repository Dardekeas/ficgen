Since fighting depression for two years, I realized that any depressants either gave too many side effects, or stopped working in a month of use. So after experimenting with my diet, and activities, I got my emotional depression, and lack of energy (somewhat) under control. But my focus and some-what lack of energy was still a mystery to me.



So I decided to try nootropic/smart drugs to see if I could find the right substances to curb the chemical imbalances in my brain. This report was compiled over two weeks. And each of these dosages were tried 2-3 times each for the sake of science and statistics.



5-HTP



At first, I tried 5-HTP, which goes as follows: taken with Sertraline (zoloft) it greatly enhanced my (assumed) serotonin levels, to the point I could feel the serotonin increasing and acting my brain. SSRI users know this feeling as a bunch of yawns, a numb apathetic feelin. The dosage and results goes as follows (without Sertraline). Each of these scenarios were experimented several times each.\begin{itemize} \item 50mg (bedtime): Sleeping is easy, but significant increase of dreaming, especially `weird' and vivid dreams. Woke up feeling much better and less groggy.\item 100mg (bedtime): Sleeping is more difficult than without 5-HTP, very restless. And once asleep I was prone to wake up 3 or so hours later because of the dreams. Woke up feeling very weird and paranoid.\item 50mg (daytime): Decent boost of energy, and slightly enhanced focus (not enough though). No mood enhancement though.\item 100mg (daytime): Typical Serotonin yawn episodes every 10 minutes, slight lethargy, and a very pronounced `fried-out' feeling not limited to staring off into the distances.\item 50mg (daytime, with sertraline): Though the serotonin effects were far more pronounced, my symptoms were alot less severe with this combination. 5-HTP also seems to counteract the sexual side effects of Sertraline. But alas, cognition was still lax.\end{itemize}I recommend 5-HTP over any pharmaceutical any day for general depression. And if you use other drugs, 5-HTP was a great suppressant for post-ecstasy crashes. And also boosted the effects of cannabis (especially the effects such as racing thoughts).



GABA



Secondly, I tried GABA in hopes of improving my cognition.\begin{itemize} \item 2000mg (by itself): No real effect, however every 30 minutes it felt as if I was not getting enough oxygen, and I began hyperventilating. Nothing too scary though. Episodes lasted about 20 seconds.\item 4000mg (by itself): No real effect noticeable still, I still have a foggy mind, but I seem to think a tad bit faster. And the breathing episodes increased in duration.\end{itemize}GABA also appeared to make my cannabis highs become a lot mellower and slow paced, and the peak high was slightly longer lasting. Also, after the fourth or fifth time with GABA 4000mg, the breathing difficulties ceased entirely.



L-Tyrosine



Thirdly, I experimented with Tyrosine.\begin{itemize} \item 1000mg (by itself): Slight mood lift, and cognition was noticeably sharper. I like where this is going. No other side effects.\item 2000mg (by itself): A better mood lift, nothing really heavy, but it helps. Cognition was the same as 1000mg.\item 1000mg (with 5-htp): This combination works great, with the cognition, mood, and energy enhancement of both - though not as effective as first few weeks of any anti-depressants SSRI or not.\end{itemize}L-Phenylalanine



Last I tried Phenylalanine, which is a precursor to Tyrosine.\begin{itemize} \item 1500mg (by itself): Same effect as Tyrosine(1000mg), but this kicked in much later.\item 2500mg (by itself): After 3 hours, I noticed some positive effects. But not as good as Tyrosine 2000mg. or Tyrosine/5-HTP combo.\end{itemize}
