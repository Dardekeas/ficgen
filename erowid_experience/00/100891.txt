Ok, Let me start off by saying that I have tripped more than most can imagine.. Lsd 80 times, shrooms 20+ times, 4-aco-dmt roughly 15 times, 2ce roughly 25 times and also 25I-nbome roughly 12 times. My fiancé at the time, which was less then two weeks ago, who now is my wife, because we got the 25c-nbome to celebrate getting married has only did shrooms and Lsd. We took this substance 4 days before our weddind. So here is the horror story.



Now take into account I am admitting we we're dumbasses, but I hope ppl take from this\ldots 



At around 3:30 pm we both snorted roughly 3 mg's each. I get up to go get dishes done so house is nice and clean for our trip, She says I am going to get on the pc and see how long it it takes to kick in, she opens the laptop and I look at her from the kitchen and she closes it right back up, I ask why didn't you look it up, she says I am already tripping.. I say no way, mine hasn't kicked in.. 2 minutes later it kicks in.



It is now 3:37 and it is hitting hard, we walk out to the back yard and the visuals are so strong it's becoming hard to see her face from 5 feet away. I hear her say she is scared and will she be ok.. I say yes and try to smile at her, but my breathing is becoming more difficult and I am also scared, but do not want her to know. 



It's now 3:40 and I help her off the steps to walk back in and sit on the couch, she sits down and ask again if she will be ok, I say would you like me to call a ambulance? She is now so out of it she doesn't really respond.



3:43 pm I grab my phone and call 911 and ask for a ambulance and tell them me and my fiancé had ingested a chemical called 25c-nbome and it was becoming harder to breath. 



3:48 5 cops come in to my home and ask what's wrong, I try to explain to them we are hallucinating and having trouble breathing and showed them the package on the table along with some 25c that was sitting there we didn't snort. That have a hard time understanding what is going on, they have never heard of it. My fiancé starts screaming at them to get her to the hospital, they tell her the ambulance is on the way.



Not sure of the time now, but it hasn't been long.. 2 paramedics walk in.. Can't remember what they said, next thing I remember is my fiancé is on a stretcher and I am walking toward the ambulance, they have me step up on it and sit on the chair behind her on the stretcher. They put iv's into us both, and start asking what we see, I try to say things are swirling and my fiancé just keeps screaming get her to the hospital. I have my had down with my eyes closed, because I am terrified at this point, I hear them say to my fiancé you better wake up now are we're putting a breathing tube down your throat, I look up and scream at her I love you and she comes back to it still screaming why isn't she at the hospital. While we're on the ambulance, I hear a cop calling someone asking about 25'c and he says they recommend benzos to counteract.  We get to the hospital and they take her off to a room and walk me to a separate room. They hook me up to a lot of wires and I am terrified. A cop walks in and says we are not pressing charges, I say great that is good to know. I have a guy who is my nurse talking to me as he checks my wires and stuff and I ask is my fiancé alive, he says yes. I say are we going to live, he says  both your heart rates were over 200, but we have them going down now. Hours go along, I miss my fiancé.. After 7 hours, both are vital signs are back to normal and they release her about 20 minutes before me.. She had called her sister in a couple hours earlier to have company. They release us both and her sister drives us home.  



We are lucky to be alive, I had did up to 8 mg's of 25I-nbome and with 3 of 25c-nbome me and my wife almost died. I will not trip again. Be safe if you do
