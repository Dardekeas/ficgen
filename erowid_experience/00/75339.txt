I smoked a gram everyday for 7 months, a gram of some damn potent shit too. But nothing prepared me for what I was about to face.



A few friends and I decided to make bud brownies for the first time, using half an ounce. 7 grams of some grand daddy purps and 7 grams of some afghani kush, I used potent bud because I was afraid it wouldn't affect me\ldots 



I was wrong.



*Ding* the brownies are done, the plates are waiting, and the potheads were anxious. We all took a relatively equal amount, mine being the largest since i doubted these `brownies'. Being the idiot I was, I also finished half a friend's piece.



The wait began. 20 minutes, nothing. 30 minutes, I'm pretty high. 40 minutes, fuck yeah. 50 minutes, what the fuck did I do to myself?!?! 



I noticed I was the only one having a bad trip. We left in the car to go smoke a joint. Unaware I could get any worse, I hit the joint 3 good times thinking it would calm me down. Nope, my brain could not process the music from the radio. I could not control my body, it was a nightmare.



Everything and everybody looked like they were rewinding super fast, leaving a trail of blur behind. A big wall was keeping me from thinking clear, I could only think about one thing at a time, literally. If I thought about an apple, I only thought of the word. Not the color, texture, or even taste.



I started doubting I would ever be normal again, I thought I was gonna stay insane, trapped in this world of anxiety. I was dropped off at my house after telling my friends I was just feeling tired and high. I tried laying down to sleep but I couldn't even do that, my room was moving back and forth, inside and out.



Without notice, I vomited on the floor. I couldn't even feel the vomit come out. It just came out like water. I began thinking about all the wrong I had done in life, everything I never savored, everything I never appreciated. For I truly thought I was going insane. I called my girlfriend, whom I love very much, and began apologizing for all the times I hurt her. Frantically I began telling her I was going to die and that I love her. The anxiety was at an all time high at this point, that I asked a friend to drive me to see my girlfriend because I seriously thought I was gonna lose my sanity. He took us back to my house.



I was scared because I knew it was possible to become chemically unbalanced in the brain, and thats what I thought had happened. When I stared into my lovers eyes, I saw double. She began looking unfamiliar and disoriented. I began forgetting who I was and every memory I ever had, my heart was pounding. I was 100\% sure this was the end of my life, I started wondering what happens when you die. I started to think you didn't go anywhere, you just blackout without knowing it, fading out of existence.



As I lay next to my girlfriend I hold her close in my last moments, hoping she would forgive me for dying. My pride kept me from crying but inside I had never felt more torn apart emotionally. To this point it had been about 5 hours.



For thirty minutes more I felt this feeling of death, and then it slowly left my mind and body. I knew I never wanted to go through that again, and I would never want anyone else to experience something so traumatic. 

I was partially glad I had gone through this `adventure' because I looked at the world differently from then on.



Every chance I get I tell my girlfriend how much I love her and appreciate her, I'm just ashamed it took a near death experience to start valuing my life.
