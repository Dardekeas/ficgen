12:00 pm - Insufflated 3mg crystals



12:15 pm - Slight surge in energy, colors are brighter, especially reds



12:30 pm - Insufflated 3 mg crystals



1:00 pm - Definite surge in energy, the come up is almost too fast, surprisingly speedy feeling.  I go about doing chores around the house, cleaning and putting things away while listening to music.  



1:30 pm - Insufflate 1mg- begin to really feel this now.  The energy is similar to coming up on mushrooms, although more `synthetic' feeling.  Music is lush and powerful, moving around is very enjoyable.  No OEV or CEV, although when I lay down for a few minutes to relax I have visions of people dancing.  I don't normally like to dance but this makes me want to for some reason.  



2:00 pm - Very sensual now.  Rubbing my skin feels wonderful.  I believe this would be a great aphrodisiac at low doses.  Emotionally I feel happy and relaxed, although there is quite a bit of tension in my body.  



3:00 pm - Coming down, but still full of energy.  Still feel that `mushroomy' buzz, almost like my body has too much oxygen. Drank a beer to calm my body a bit.  It definitely helped, as did a cigarette.



I came down very slowly after this, still feeling the drug at around 7pm.  Later that night I was quite tired and slept soundly for 8 hours and had very vivid dreams.



At this dosage I felt effects similar to low dose mushrooms along with the more pleasant aspects of MDMA.  In fact there were several moments where I felt just like I was on MDMA, but they came and went unpredictably.  



There were moments when the physical sensuality of it was almost overwhelming and uncomfortable, even at this rather modest dose.
