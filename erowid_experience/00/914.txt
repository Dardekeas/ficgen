i had been reading/hearing about the effects of nutmeg for a long time, so when i moved into this new place i decided to have a little party on my own and bought 35gm of the ground nut. it was about 4pm when i took half of it in a glass of water (tasted shitty but not impossible to swallow). waited for about one hour but didn't feel any significant effect apart from a light buzz, as if i'd just had a pint or two of lager, so i decided to take the rest of it. a few minutes later i felt like taking a nap (i was up since 7 in the morning, which is fucking early for me, so i didn't think it was the nutmeg kicking in). when i woke up at about 9pm i felt really sick and tired. i made some pasta and as i finished eating it i became aware of the effect. it was a bit like pot but i felt generally more energetic and there wasn't any of the branched way of thinking that pot gives you. i listened to some happy/funky music for some time. there was definitely some kind of sound distortion going on because, even though the cd wasn't even that good, i still remember dancing, jumping and laughing alone in my room, like a complete nutter. i don't know how long that went on for, it could've been 20 minutes or two hours later when i realized i was also having visual hallucinations (quite pleasant actually). 



jimi started coming out of the poster in the wall and smile at me. but at one point things started to turn really nasty, paranoia started kicking in and i found it really hard to control myself. i was walking up and down the house thinking i had completely lost it, that it wasn't the nutmeg that was making me trip but that i had actually gone mad. i tried to sleep but couldn't, instead went into this kind of delirious nightmarish state where i didn't know whether i was dreaming or awake, as if sounds and images from my head were materializing inside the room throughout the night.



when i came around at about 5am i was still hallucinating, the ceiling was completely covered in twisting, black and white mandalas. my eyes were still bloodshot red and my mouth and throat were dry as never before. i felt really sick and threw up some black and green stuff which at the time i thougth were bits of my liver. i had a really bad hangover for the rest of the day and still felt a bit slow/dumb for a few days after. about two weeks later i decided to take nutmeg again, this time i took only about 15 to 20gm and i didn't feel much apart from a lighter version of the delirious sleep and a hangover which was just as nasty as the first one. 

even after a few months from that time i still had some weird kind of flashback experiences (especially after a few spliffs), which weren't pleasant but were not particularly bad. i wouldn't recommend nutmeg as a recreational drug, it is a nasty experience overall and not very healthy. but if you don't give a fuck and want to try it anyway, do not underestimate it.
