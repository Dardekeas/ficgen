2 weeks ago I ordered 8 oz's of kava kava root from a popular online vendor.  I was mostly interested in its purported anti-anxiety effects.



For consumption I decided to follow a simple recipe that shipped with the order. I placed 1/2 cup kava kava powder with 2 cups water and 1 cup milk along with 3 TBS olive oil, into a blender and proceeded to blend for the suggested 5 minutes. I didn't bother with a strainer I just poured the entire amount into a tall glass.   



I took the glass outside and stared at the brown murky substance.  I knew it had a reputation for being `bitter', but I was in no way prepared for the reality once I took my first sip.  Its hard to express just how awful it tastes.  It seems simple enough to just chug it down.  But it is so disgustingly vile it took a great deal of sheer will power just to finish this large glass.  



After I successfully downed the foul liquid I felt a sense of accomplishment and at the same time wondered how am I ever going to drink this crap again.  I experienced the well documented initial numbing of the mouth. I decided to lay out on the grass and `bask' in the sun.  Still not quite over the horrendous experience that was drinking the kava.  I quietly wondered if I would actually feel anything or if it would be a horribly tasting farce.



For the first 10-15 min I felt nothing out of the usual.  Normally I can only take about 15 min of `basking' in mid day, due to preoccupation or boredom,  but after drinking the kava I was feeling no need to move and I continued to lay eyes closed with the sun beaming down on my face.



At around 25 - 30 min after consumption I noticed a slight tingle in the back of my neck.  I also felt some very pleasant sensation when pushing either arm against the ground.  I played around with manipulating this feeling. I found if I took in a deep breath and held it while I pushed very lightly with both my arms I could hold this incredible feeling for short periods. I would describe this feeling as a cross between an orgasm and the high produced by hydrocodone (vicodin).



While I was enjoying the onset of effects immensely it began to cloud over and I had been laying down for quite a while so I decided to get up and walk around a little. Its here I realized how `high' I truly was.



The first thing I noticed when I walked around was an alcohol like visual tracer effect, where you turn your head somewhat sharply and it takes a few moments for things to get in sync. It was not unlike being slightly drunk. I also had a powerful `vicodin' like buzz going on.  At this point I felt wonderful no queasiness and an extremely enjoyable euphoric sensation.  I was also very happy to know that I didn't just waste \$27 dollars and it IS worth it to drink that pile of crap.  I must also comment that I had no idea it would affect me to this degree.  I read many reports where people claimed to feel nothing.  This was a powerful narcotic experience.  No two ways about it.  Its not a matter of just feeling relaxed and peaceful. I was extremely high and my ability to function was limited.



There was a downside however. A very noticeable queasiness set in after 3-4 hours.  



I couldn't believe how long I felt the effects.  I took the intial dosage at around 1 PM and when I went to bed nearly 12 hours later I was still slightly high but felt rather sick to my stomach. 



I still have over half the package left and am experimenting with ways to make it slightly more bearable to drink as well as limit the nausea.



Kava kava can be very intoxicating highly euphoric and easily equals taking a few vicidon with alcohol.  It does have its down sides. To really get the effects you will have to drink a considerable amount of HORRENDOUS VOMIT INDUCING LIQUID.  And I have yet to get the extreme high without at least moderate nausea. But if you are willing to get past the horrible taste and nausea, you will be rewarded with a very intense and pleasurable high.  Oh and its legal.
