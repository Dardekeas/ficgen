I am a 19 year old college student currently undergoing testing for THC due to an incident which occurred several months ago.  I am not one to obey authority, so I have been researching ways in which I might cheat my urine tests.  To see how long THC lasts in my body, I went online and bought some test strips for about 3 bucks a piece.  I then proceeded to test myself in order to find out how long THC remains in my body.  Relevant information about me before I begin;



Body type:  about 6ft, skinny, fast metabolism

Amount ingested: 1/4-1/2 a gram of high mids

Food ingested: I ate small meals, consisting of a ham sandwich and french fries with ketchup, two glasses of pop, and ice cream.

Water ingested:  about 5-6 glasses a day

Time of previous ingestion: 2 months, no THC present in my body



Ingested marijuana, evening

T+24 hrs: positive

48 hrs: positive

72 hrs: positive

96 hrs: tested negative for THC, but the urine test indicated that it could still detect trace amounts in my system below the 50 ng/ml cutoff.  

120 hrs: clear



Conclusion: Males with a body type similar to mine, who are smoking for the first time in several months, should be capable of clearing their system within 5 days under no special conditions. 4 days after ingestion one still has trace amounts in the body, but these amounts are below the cutoff line for standard tests.  However, I would advise allowing oneself at least 5 days to allow oneself to be tested.
