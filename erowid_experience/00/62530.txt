My Kratom experience was purely horrible!  I am a heavy-set, fairly healthy twenty-six year old female who is not currently on any medications.  I have had limited experiences with psychoactives (I drink and smoke cannabis once a month or so, and have tried shrooms and salvia before and had enjoyable experiences).



Kratom is just bad, though.  I had drank the tea at around 10:15 pm, while it was bitter, it tasted much like other herbal teas that I have drank.  I immediately felt a slight buzz, much like what I experience from alcohol.  However, that's when everything went downhill.



I began to feel nauseous at about the same time that I began to catch a buzz, and the sensation only grew stronger until I was covered in sweat and dry-heaving.  (I hadn't had anything to eat since dinner at around 5:30 pm.)  Feeling weakened but relieved, I went to bed at around midnight and hoped that I'd feel better in the morning.



Fast forward to 11 am the next morning.  I had slept soundly, but felt absolutely horrible.  I couldn't so much as stand up without feeling profoundly weak and nauseous.  Attempting to drink water and juice (in an attempt to stay hydrated) yielded violent stomach cramps and almost-projectile vomiting.  I was forced to cancel my day's plans and stay in bed.  At around 9:00 pm, the nausea subsided and I was able to drink some soup without it making a reappearance.



I promptly threw away the rest of the kratom that I had in my stash.  Never again!!!
