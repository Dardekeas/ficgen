I received my 2C-T-7 the day before the last two deaths were reported. If I had seen these earlier, I would have never ordered the material. As it stands, I'm glad I ordered when I did.



Having read the reports like everyone else, I expected a visual trip. Aside from a few mushroom journeys, it had been a good decade since my tripping days and I was primed and excited to reintroduce myself to these states. Because of this excitement, my first experience with 2C-T-7 was a major dissapointment. 20mg and another 10mg at T+2:00. Slight visual disturbance, annoying oscillations between hot and cold, no insights, no sense of awe, and a general feeling of irritability. I spent the majority of the trip dwelling an how `bunk' it felt.



My next experience proved much more fruitful. Having much lower expectations and the goal of understanding my apathy, I took 40mg on an empty stomach. The slow ramp-up (1.5-2hrs) gave me plenty of time to kick myself for trying this stuff again. Had a brief wave of fear thinking about the related deaths, which was quickly dispelled out of necessity, `not going down this road!' with a smile and feline distraction. T+2.5, I'm in. `Oooh, I see! This feels goood!'  I curl up in a ball on the rug, rocking back and forth letting warm waves of pleasure pulse thru my body. Friendly. Safe. Similar to E, but different. A taste of acid, but just a taste. Visuals were more pronounced, but their importance seemed irrelevant, just an after-thought in the full, sensuous body of the trip. Cut to the chase\ldots 



The crying begins! After a couple of hours enjoying myself, I focus on my goal. `What was it? Come to terms with something\ldots ' I start to weep. I realize how desperately lonely I am. How I push away my friends. How I've fooled myself into believing this is O.K. How I've distracted myself from years of pain. Deep, gut-wrenching sobs, snotty, wonderful tears. It's now that I notice I'm in two seperate and distinct mental states. My `crying self' realizes it's being watched by my `observer self' who's grinning ear to ear. `Don't let me stop you boy! Carry on!'  I'm dissoriented and confused, I shift between these perspectives and can't resolve them into `me'. I can't express how distinct these `individuals' were.

Was I so cut off from my true emotions that this is how they have to manifest? I watch this force of `emotion' in my mind's eye. Wow, emotion is powerful! I realize my `crying self' has been starving. The `observer's' yelling `Go baby, Go!' I finish my first true cry in years under the watchful, caring gaze of myself.

At some point I became `me' again and laughed, and thought, and laughed, till the wee hours of the morning:) 



My third experience with 2C-T-7 was pure fun. 30mg. I knew what to expect, I knew what it could do, and I knew that I liked it. 



My verdict on 2C-T-7? You get out what you put in.
