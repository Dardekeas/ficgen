I had heard stories of people experimenting with benadryl, DXM, and coricidron, even a few of my friends had tried it.



At first I was nervous because I could not get over the idea of taking so many pills at once.  The week before i tried diphenhydramine, one of my friends tried taking eight pills of dramamine and had a pretty strange trip. I forgot what happened though.



I took about 400 mg of generic brand benadryl at around 5:00.  I started feeling the effects about an hour later when my friend came over.  I did not tell him that I had taken the benadryl.



The first thing that I really noticed in the trip was the added weight to my arms and legs.  It did not feel the same as when I am high and my arms and legs feel heavy, this felt like i had weights tied to my wrists and ankles and were pulling me down.  My mouth was very dry.  I would then look at the wall, and it seemed as if there were many tiny dots on it, and it looked very grainy.



I got another call from another friend who was having a party, we went over there and I had a little trouble keeping my balance.  When I was there at times it seemed as if I was spacing out, and it would take me a few moments to respond.  No one figured it out that I was on anything but I did not really like the trip. After awhile I felt very sleepy and was able to fall asleep almost immediately that night.



It wasn't as great of an experience as I was hoping for but it was not too bad.
