I acquired a tablet of 2C-C for fifteen dollars.  It was a fairly large, white pill, clearly labelled `2C-C'.



I hadn't eaten in about ten hours, so the effects came on in about twenty minutes to a half hour.  The main impact was relaxation and a feeling of being `chill'.  The physical effects were pleasant tingling sensations and waves of warmth throughout my body.  My coordination was slightly impaired, but I was still walking around with little difficulty.  There were some visual effects - colors moved around a little bit - but they weren't especially striking.



The main impacts were emotional.  I was grinning and giggling somewhat uncontrollably, not because of an enhanced sense of humor like with cannabis, but almost as an involuntary reaction.  I took the drug in a very bad mood after some unpleasant events, and while the drug did not exactly make me forget them, it dulled my emotional reaction to them.  My internal narrative went `it's okay!  You are still a worthwhile person, it's not a big deal' even though I was rationally aware of these experiences.  Psychedelic trance music sounded great, but not because of any sensory enhancement like with cannabis; I was just relaxed and enjoying it.



The experience lasted about two to three hours, after which I went to sleep.  The next morning, I felt slightly stupid, but otherwise unaffected, and my mood was somewhat brightened.  Overall, this was not exactly a mind-blowing experience, but it was pretty enjoyable as a tool for relaxation.
