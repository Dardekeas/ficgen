I had just recently moved away and had gone home to visit some old friends and party alittle bit. I am a very expierenced pot smoker. And have also drank many times.



It was 10:45pm and we had just gotten 1/4 ounce of some decent marijuana. There were 3 other people there besides myself.



We started off the night by chillen and sittin around, smoking cigarettes, and watching tv. When the time came to smoke, we got out my friends bong, and I decided to go first. I was very excited about this trip, it had been a month or so since I had smoked, and I had been with my good friends. So I was eager to smoke. I started off taking a huge hit, I held the smoke in for some 30-40 seconds and then exhaled, to amazing find I was already starting to get buzzed. My body was numbing slowly, and everything around me just made me happy. Soon enough the first bowl was finished and I was definitely high.



Everyone had left the room but myself, they had gone to call some friends up and make this private affair into a little party. I smoked the 2nd bowl all by myself, and I could tell the outside world was different from before. My distance judgement had gone to hell. I stood up, looking to get something to drink, my mouth was dry and didn't feel good. Cottonmouth has always been an issue while I was high. Right when I got to the fridge I forgot what I was there for and didn't remember for some 15 minutes or so. Eventually I got some pop, and walked back into the smoking room.



The air was filled with smoke and the beautiful fragrence of marijuana was in the air. I felt so good, to my suprise there were 6 people there that I didn't even know had entered the house. I knew only 2 of them I was a little tense being around people that I don't know. This cleared after I helped finish off a third bowl. I was in a state of complete euphoria. My body was numb and I was without a care. Thoughts raced through my mind, about everything that I thought was good in the world. I felt completely blessed. It was amazing. I was a little hesitant about smoking anymore, considering this was some really really potent stuff, considering I was wasted on 3 bowls.



I was extremely hungry at this point and found there was no food in the house. I was angered by this, but immediately returned to happiness. My friend suggested I tame my appetite by smoking a few more bowls with the gang. Soon enough I had smoked 4 more bowls. Incredible! I am feeling overwhelmingly stoned, every movement I make feels like I'm floating, almost sexual, It felt good just to move a finger, or blink my eyes. It was now 2:30am and then night felt like it had been going on forever.



I went into the living room to get out of the smoking scene for awhile and explore my surroundings. When I entered the living room, there was a girl named Nicole sitting on the couch watching TV. I sat in the loveseat nearby, and tried to engage in any form conversation that I could with her, but by this point I couldn't talk. I couldn't move. I was dead. I wasn't tired, but I was slipping in and out of conciousness, all the while trying to comprehend what was going on, on the tv.



Soon enough a guy appeared out of what seemed to be nowhere, he was demanding that everyone take a bite out of the gigantic sub-sandwhich that he had purchased. I opened my mouth and he shoved the sandwhich in my mouth, I immediately realized that there was something in the sandwhich that I didn't like, pickles and onions. These two things made me very sick, very quickly. I pretended like I needed to take a crap, and attempted to go in my friend's bathroom, where I found it was being occupied by someone else, so I went to the private bathroom, my best friend's (person who lived at this house) mom's bathroom. Where I knew no one was allowed to go, so I would be safe to throw up and no one would walk in and find out.



I threw up the sandwhich. It tasted horrible coming up, but soon enough I couldn't feel my mouth anyways, and my taste buds had been temporarily killed off. I returned to the couch to find I was all alone, just me and the tv. I felt connected to the characters in the show. Even though I was in no way relatable to the people in reality. I then suddenly became sick.



I was dead again. I felt like my soul had been ripped from my body, and I was no longer alive. The room blackend, and suddenly I was all alone, alone in a chair, nothing at all around me. I could hear music and voices in the distance but I felt as if maybe I really was dead, even though in the back of my mind I knew it was only the drug's effects on me. I then lit a cigarette and took a long hit. The world was back, I was now in my friend's bed room, sitting in a wooden chair, AMAZING! how did I get from the living room to here. Everyone was tapping their fingers on me and asking me alot of questions, to which all, my best friend replied `He's fucked up, just leave him alone, he's alright'.



I finished off about half of the cigarette and then set it down in the ash tray everyone was using. I went and layed on my friend's bed, just staring up at the ceiling. Out of nowhere a girl named Pricsella laid on the bed right beside me, not close, but she was looking right at me, she smiled and said `You gonna be alright?', I just smiled as my reply to her question. She got up and walked out of the room. I felt reborn. I felt as if I died in the living room and was rebirthed in the bedroom, a new person. Happier. I was smiling ALOT at this point and had found some chips to eat. I devoured nearly half of the bag, and then ate an entire bag of chex mix spicy flavored type. I felt so good. I felt like I had beaten all odds, and the world was beautiful again.



I soon enough was walking around the house, semi-socializing. I felt so good. I was coming down from my intense smoking session. I entered the bedroom once again and found there was a little weed to spare. So me and my best friend smoked another bowl and a half. I was pleasently high again. It was now 4:30am. Everyone was starting to depart to go home. I was spending the night at his place, so I went in the next room, and decided to go to sleep. I fell asleep as If I was a small child, not a care in the world.



I awoke the next morning, covered in flour. What had happened!? I was laying in a pile of the white flour. It was in my ear, in my long hair, and in my eyes. I couldn't believe it, I didn't even know this had been done to me. My friends had thrown 3 hand fulls of flour at `rapid speeds' as my friend explained at my head, smacking with loud flesh like sounds each time, and I didn't even budge, so they left me alone. I went to the bathroom and took a shower. I felt clean and renewed. I was hung over, nothing noticable though. I just felt tired, run down. This passed after eating breakfast.



To this date I have never had a more `powerful' expierence with weed. I didn't even know weed could make me react in the way that it did that night. So many effects on my body. It felt so good. I will definetaly smoke large amounts of weed like I did again. Hopefully to find a similar expierence.



I had been smoking for about 2 years, before I had this expierence. It is definitely worth while in the end. That night has forever changed me, I see the world in a new light. I enjoy doing things more, I enjoy being with good friends more. I think it has indirectly made me a better person.
