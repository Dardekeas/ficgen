I started using these pills because they were easy to get as I don't really have any illicit drug contacts and they were cheap.  I basically just wanted to get fucked up and ironically I am completely fucked up all the time now.  I shake and my balance is off all the time.  I find it hard to swallow, burp, stand still without swaying and my perception of the world is fucked as my vision is off.  I constantly talk shit and I have found I am a lot more confident as I used to be shy but when your fucked nothing matters.  Don't even start using these pills.  You lose complete control of who you are.  I only started using these pills a few months ago and I'm already fucked up.  My only conselation now is that I can hopefullly stop others from using them.  I've been down to the depths of feeling shit and although sometimes I feel really really good on these pills, its just not worth it.  I've lost who I am and that really sucks.  Take my advice: don't do it.
