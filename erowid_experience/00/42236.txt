Over the last several years, I had become dependent (addicted) to hydrocodone. I had several orthopedic problems and several surgeries, so at first I was using the drug to alleviate my pre and post surgical pain. However, my tolerance quickly grew and I found myself taking more and more hydrocodone everyday. Quitting `cold turkey' was not an option because the intense withdrawal would hit me quickly if I went even one day without the pills. 



Finally, after many unsuccessful attempts at trying to quit (detox included), I have finally discovered that Ambien is working quite well to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms. When I take the drug during the day, it helps with any cravings I might have to go back to the hydrocodone. On the other hand, when taken at night, it helps me sleep through the night without the `restless legs syndrome' that most people in opioid withdrawal experience.
