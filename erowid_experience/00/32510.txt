 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



I tried gasoline huffing. It was one of the worst things I've ever done. I was in my garage, and I tried it because I heard people saw hallucinations and vibrant colors and so forth. I went to my garage, took the gas can, put my hand over the nozzle, and put my mouth on my hand, and started to inhale. As I took my first few inhalations, I got a little lightheaded and went inside. 



I wasn't satisfied, so I went back took about 20 more hits. As I was kneeling, this plastic sandwich bag turned blue and purple, and I could feel my brain throbbing, and I went in my house and everything I heard had like a crackly echo to it and started to make me panic and paranoid, and I could barely think . My motor skills were severely affected and could barely think for what seemed forever, which was only 5 minutes. I felt like a living vegetable and my experience was horrible and I truly regret it. My experience made me feel as if I was melting my brain.
