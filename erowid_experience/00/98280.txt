So here's how it went:



Somehow, through all the chaos revolving around, me and a couple of carefully selected friends managed to get our hands on the brew.. 

After watching and reading all the material we could get our hands on, we decided that it would be such a pity to miss the 2012 threshold without experiencing our favorite tryptamine, and so we did.. we started searching various methods to get DMT from the local fauna (being in the central western Europe, the traditional plants are quite hard to come by).  That's until a friend got the idea to search for ayahuasca, maybe we'll manage to find someone willing to ship it to our country. And what do you know.. the second day we started searching, poof! We had ourselves both mimosa hostilis root and Syrian rue seeds, so you can imagine we were really excited..



The night we got them, we gathered at swim's house and brewed the brew.. as it turned out, the liquid really is purple (which is weird in itself, add on top of that that the roots are dark brown, not mauve). All over the internet, various experience reports said that the taste is horrible, and let me just tell you that it's a totally unique taste.. at first it's horrible, but if you associate it with what exactly has that specific taste, it will soon be more like a hiccup than `that weird drink that tastes like feet'. And it does taste like feet! Feet with lemon, the bitterness in tonic water and all that is wrong with quinces! It's like watching The Lord Of The Rings with the intro theme performed by Lil' john -- you'd expect to get used to it and who knows, actually like it further down the road.. but it never happens! 



The first glasses were filled with the MAOI inhibitor from the Syrian rue seeds.. they weren't too bad and there was no noticeable effect during the 40 minutes that led to the DMT. After the DMT went into our bellies, my body started rejecting it.. mildly at first with some stomach ache. Around the 5 minute mark, the vomiting reflex was already creeping in on me.. hell, I threw up like a pregnant hippo (I suspect the scientific term for hippos include projectile and aftermath). According to the Ayahuasca culture, the brew will cleanse your mind, body and spirit, and the order is it's to decide. 



After the first initial purge, everything around me changed. While it stayed the same. Books were independently moving on shelves, the floor seemed to be the saddest part of the room while the roof looked like a cloudy heaven for the two mosquitoes that were lurking, the music in the background melted with various sounds in my head, some memories, some imagination, some that seemed to be of a higher nature. As I closed my eyes, I expected to see the sacred geometry that everybody reported. Instead, it was like my imagination was on NoS, analyzing memories, reinterpreting them, giving them new shapes and colors, new meaning, a different message altogether. A flood of information bathed in all the emotions you can think of rushed in my head, making the dizziness even stronger and the balance between feeling good and bad almost unbearable. Eventually the thread led me intro some pretty dark corners of my mind, with images and feelings that make nightmares seem so real. It was only until I found an equilibrium between the alternating states that the ache in the gut started to send me signals that another purge was under way. 



I barfed. I barfed so bad, it was like my body, with every single cell, was getting rid of the now problem filled brew. It felt like I was literally vomiting negativity, doubt, fear and all the bad states that come along. It was horrible. It was wonderful. Like clockwork, I knew when I was done. All of my muscles relaxed, I was in for the next level. Being somewhat exhausted from all the straining, I decided, in that moment, that I will lay down. And so I did. And I closed my eyes. And that's when the shit hit the fan! 

Beautiful fractal arcs bended and twisted in front of my eyes. Shadows darker than the pitch black that was under my eyelids emerged and gained the most random shapes imaginable. Sketches of abstract shapes danced all in sync, separating and combining with each other, forming a fractal jellyfish that kept the same rhythm that I was pulsating in. The dark became darker and the shapes became clearer and clearer, even though they would appear for only several seconds at a time. The intensity of each flash became almost unbearable, reaching the point of snuff like videos, cascades of blood with dead bodies and gore everywhere! I opened my eyes for a second, just to close them again, and in the coal dark that surely followed, a pair of bright green eyes were staring at me. And I stared back. And the more I stared, the more I realized that those eyes were looking at me. From within my eyelids, from behind my eyes, somebody was looking at me, and it wasn't a happy look. The eyes grew contour and a head, becoming more and more human until it reached a state where it looked at a girl I've been dating for a longer period in my past. 



Now keep in mind that to my conscious mind, I had absolutely no issues with that person, I was carrying no baggage and was completely happy and at peace with what turned to be one of  the most painful relationships of my life. So this girl appeared, looking through brightly lit yellowish green eyes, and she came closer, as if to say something to my ear. And the closer she got, the more demonic her face became -- wrinkles formed all over her face, thousands of vampiric teeth appeared out of nowhere and it only stopped when all of them were completely sinked in my throat. I can stress this enough, this wasn't one of those dreams in which you think you might feel pain, I literally felt the energy from my body being sucked and turning me into an inert raisin. With all my strength, I forced it away from me, pushing it lower and lower in my gut until the it happened.

I rose as struck by lightning, desperately trying to find the bowl in which to throw up. The first reflex was to cover my mouth with my hand, and when that happened, I felt the whole being that was harming me raising from my stomach, through my throat and almost hitting my hand. I managed to throw a quick glimpse at one of my friends who had his eyes staring into my soul before I went ahead and threw up more than I could possibly thought I could. My whole body strained, fighting and contracting, reaching to the point of `NO MORE' and then going some more. All that was malicious in the previous minutes was simply thrown away, dismissed and spat. I couldn't shake the feeling of the brew being like a sponge, collecting and purifying and then dragging all the dirt and the `nasty' along with it on it's way out. 



I was re-born. I knew precisely when the last bit of whatever dark mix was inside me found it's way out and boy what a feeling that was! I felt the most uplifting sensation, the sensation that cons probably get when being released from prison. I felt that a piece of my soul had cancer, and that cancer was destroyed faster than my ability to fully comprehend what was going on. Closing my eyes i felt the most soothing feminine touch on my face, I felt 18 and in love, ready to feel love, like this huge boulder was lifted from my heart and soul. I fell in love with everything and everyone, I was ready to endure anything and I felt invincible in the most humble way. And everytime I looked down at the bowl full of foul looking liquid, I couldn't help feeling a sense of deep respect and appreciation. What can I say, the words are limited to only so much and I still feel that I covered well below 20\% of what truly happened. It was one hell of an experience, to say the least..
