From the day I started using drugs my life changed. About a year and a half ago I took my first pill of Ecstasy at a rave in Oakland, and had a blast, and I guess between now and then I have done E at least 50 or 60 times. I usually always had a great time except when I went to Cyberfest, a massive rave, in June of this year. 



Planning to roll I had brought 2 pills of Ecstasty with me, both of them being four leaf clovers or `shamrocks' I had got from home. Pills had always taken around an hour or so to kick in for me, so I was ready to take my pill around 11:45 with a few of my friends. I had also obtained a hit of LSD, something I have also done at least 70 or so times. I've never had a bad trip in all my times of doing either ecstasy or acid, so Cyberfest was certainly a surprise to me. One of the pills I had taken was crushed and I hadn't eaten much that day but I was surprised when no less than 10 minutes later I began to feel fucked up. I had gone down a slide and when I got to the bottom I knew something definantly wasn't right. I had to sit down to put my shoes back on and then a few friends and I made our way to the bathrooms. While my friends took care of their business I sat down and thoughts began running through my head the something wierd was happening, it was all hitting me way too fast and way too hard, I kept thinking `I'll be ok, I just dont want to be one of those people who ends up having siezures and convulsing on the ground with crowds standing around them,' that just wasn't me. After my friends had finished we all got up and started to head over to the drink stand and then make our way back across the fairgrounds to where our towns meeeting spot was (the ravers in my city are all pretty close). We got a drink and I told one of my close friends that I was way too fucked up and felt as if I was going to have trouble walking, then I did. Half way to the other side I had to stop and sit down. 



Whenever I would open my eyes everything was really blurry, I couldn't focus and things were just moving from side to side. My legs felt so weak that a couple of my friends picked me up and helped me out of the way of traffic to the metting place. I dont remember everything that happened for about 3 or 4 hours of the night, something that also has never happened to me. I had to sit down for a long time with my knees up and my head down. I felt safe as long as I had a friend close by. I felt as if I was a inconvience having to be babysat but I knew without them I would have become lost. I thought I was going blind because opening my eyes and focusing was almost immposible. When I would stand up I had no balance and would shake back and fourth becasue my feet felt as if they were 3 inches long and I would try to touch the ground because I felt as if I was down on my knees. Since I had no balance I just had to sit there. 



After a few hours of that I began to regain my vision, the LSD I had taken early was still hitting me so I was full of energy. After I shook it off I was fine and frying pretty hard still. It was definintly an experiance I wouldn't want to go through again. I knew something must have been wrong with the pills I had taken because 2 was about average and I had never had anything even close to that happen to me. I knew that I just had to maintain and stay awake. It hit me really hard and was a strange feeling of being out of control of my body which I didnt like. I hadn't heard about DXM or bad news about the clovers at that time but I know now and would spread the word not to take them.
