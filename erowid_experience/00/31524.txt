About a week ago I have been reading numerous reports on this site about all sorts of drugs, then started reading specifically on household drugs. I found out that you could trip on Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). So I thought I would try. I read about 10 reports on this, so I had in mind what was going to happen. 



Last night at about 8:30 I took 13 benadryl pills. at about 9:10 I found it a bit more difficult to read and understand what I was reading. 



I started playing my guitar at about 9:30 and things started to jump, out of the corner of my eye, not very often, it would happen every 5 minutes and only like 3 times. I read that you start talking to people that aren't even there, that never happened to me. I read a report where he only had 250mg, and he talked to people. But I know it is different for everyone.



I decided to lay down in my bed at about 10:15. at 10:30 Jay leno came on so I watched that. I was already kinda disapointed cuz it had been 2 hours, and nothing major had happened. Around oh 10:45 I remember falling asleep numerous times, only like 5 seconds, but it seemed forever. I remember falling asleep and waking up out of a dream it seemed like. (the only `hallucination' I ever got) I woke up to the sound of bubbles like coming out of the ocean. And that was it. After that I was very alert for some reason and didnt fall back asleep.



I went to bed around 12. Still nothing had happened. woke up about 1 am with MAJOR cotton mouth. I remembered I had a glass of water sitting next to my bed so I reached down to get it to check if there was anything left and it spilt all over me. So at first I thought this was a hallucination and I was excited. Then I realized that it wasnt going away and I had to clean it up. Then I remember talking over my guitar that was at the end of my bed, I also thought that was a hallucination, but no it wasn't. Went to bed and woke up at 7AM, then went to school.



I felt very sick at school with cotton mouth and the taste of those pills. It was Horrible, I was very dissapointed. it is 7:30 Pm, and I STILL have cotton mouth and feel sick. From my experience that was the dumbest thing I have ever done, and recomend it to anyone who wants to feel sick for an entire day.
