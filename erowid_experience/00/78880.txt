My wife and I live in a town that's been dry of anything illicit and nice to smoke for over two weeks. We read reports, in the newspaper, suggesting that `spice gold' was not going to be legal for long, and that it contained cannabinoids. We decided to give it a try.



We put some in a joint with a little tobacco, and twenty minutes later we both knew that we wouldn't be smoking too much of this.



An hour later we knew that we would never smoke this again: The paranoia and heart palpitations that I had were awful, I felt floaty but not in a nice way, it felt like influenza without the joint pain. 



The effects lasted much longer than cannabis, and even a couple of hours later I didn't feel well, even with the comparatively low dose that I had taken, I felt a general malaise and suffered a persistent aphasia for hours. This wasn't the happy smoke that we missed. The rest of the Â£30 sachet we bought is still untouched, even though we're still dry here.



I would not recommend this to anyone.
