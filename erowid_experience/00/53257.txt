Unaware of the standard dose I packed a two-skin cigarette with roughly 1-5g of Calea zacatechichi and smoked it shortly before retiring to bed. Although bitter, the smoking experience isn't entirely distasteful, but the lingering after-taste is. There were no obvious mental or physical effects following the smoke.



After rinsing my mouth with peppermint I retired to bed and began to meditate. Almost immediately I realised that my mind was clear, almost thoughtless and decluttered. It was a pleasing effect and greatly aided my meditation. 



The main reason I decided to try Calea zacatechichi was for the hypnagogic imagery. I wasn't dissapointed, I fell into a delightful wave of hypnagogics before passing into unconsiousness. 



This morning I awoke and felt as if I'd been asleep for days. I was aware that I'd experienced a very heavy, restful sleep but, strangely enough, I do remember waking a few times during the night, something I don't normally do.



As for dreams, my memory was very foggy, I could remember fragments of dreams, but nothing unusual, vivid or striking. In fact, the only dream I DO remember with any clarity was that the pop singer Madonna had decided to launch her own clothes range! :)



To summarise: a very subtle, mind-clearing herb, useful aid for me in trance or meditation. Hypnagogics were increased. 



I intend to continue experimenting nightly.
