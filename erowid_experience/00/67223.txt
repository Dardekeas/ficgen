I've been using a prescription med named Dorken. It contains 25 mgs of Tranxilium [Clorazepate], 150 mgs GABOB and 75 mgs Piridoxine (B6 vitamin). I got to it because of anxiety problems, and I have used it for more than 8 years, discontinued for some periods.



I have taken from half a pill, sometimes a quarter, to 2 or 2 and a half pills. And I can compare it to others benzodiazepines. Even with the tranxilium itself alone.



I have NEVER found any psychoactive effect, such any resembling something rewarding or a happy feeling. The only happiness I got from this compound, is the anxiolitic effect. It is more anxiolitic and more long lasting than tranxilium, probably with faster effect, but not as much a flunitrazepam (Rohypnol). The reason because they use this 3 compounds together is =to form the naturally ocurring compound GABA in the brain, it's needed the GABOB and in another metabolic step, a form of piridoxine.



So taking it as prescription med, is not anyway funny, but it really kicks anxiety when other benzos can't get it totally. 



I have ocassionally administered this drug to other people, in small dosages, as a quarter or half pill. And all of them find it more rewarding than other typical benzodizepines. Specially mention to a woman that with a quarter of that pill, said in a lot of ocasions, that she was happy for the real first time in her life, because `the little dwarfs she had in her chest' had been blown away and that never had happened to her before. Obviously she had a long anxiety problem that has never been treated, but when she went to therapy, no other benzodiazepine could make her feel the same feeling of peace and calm. I have to say that this woman, had an entheogenic experience with 10 mgs Zolpidem. I mean that she was awake after taking it, and she was really in a world of incredible visions, afraid, but always knowing where she was, who she was, etc. And as that effects were there to stay for a while, the best option was sex. So she had an incredible experience as far as long she has never taken any other drug, nor cannabis.

And she is not a psychotic. Just suffers some anxiety ocasionally, and has a normal way of living, far away from drugs.



And I personally, when I have felt really nervous, even having a lot of possibilities to choose from, if I find the feeling to be really hard, I always choose the GABOB-Piridoxine-Tranxilium option.



After long term use, even with no large dosage, such as half a pill a day, if I stop use abruptly, I won't feel problems the first day, or even the next one\ldots  but after the second day, I'll get more anxiety than I have experienced before. Far much more than with other benzos or sleep help, like Zolpidem, alpralozam, bromacepam, etc. So stop its use with smaller steps.
