This is an experience that has changed my life for ever. I have always thought myself to be a pretty safe experimentalist when it came to drugs. I regularly smoke weed, done mushrooms, painkillers, antidepressants, dxm, alchohol, and various other things. Well one day I came into possession of 25 wellbutrin pills (bupropion) they were 150 milligram time released pills. So I did a little research on it but still made a bad judgement in dosage. Some where I read that 6-8 pills was a normal dose. So I chewed up nine at lunch time around 10:45 and my friend G took chewed ten and my other friend C chewed 3 and swallowed 3 whole. First off let me tell that was the worst tasting pill I have ever chewed there is nothing else like it. Also these were time released pills another thing I did not realize.



10:45- Took pills and ate some food, pretty much a normal lunch. No real effects other than kind of feeling like I might of been coming up, kind of lightheaded.



11:45- In ceramics class and really starting to notice some effects. First I became really energetic and talkative, a lot like aderral. But that lasted about 15 minutes as my heart began beating faster and faster and I felt very uneasy. I began breathing very very fast and felt like I had just ran miles.



12:15- Feeling very exhausted, my friend G isn't doing so well either he looks very pale and clammy. My heart was beating so sporadically that it would have felt better if it just stopped beating. I was starting to get really paranoid because I knew I was sick and it wasn't getting any better.



1:00- Realizing I might overdose I decided to rest as best I could in my next class, I spent the whole period breathing deep and trying to rest. I went to look at myself in the mirror and my pupils were dilated insanely and my eyes were kind of a greyish color. And my heart was still racing like crazy.



2:30- Finally at home I tried to eat some food but I could barely get anything down as I had cotton mouth to the extreme. So I decided to lie down in my room and this is when it got really weird. As I lie there in my room I began hearing a high pitch hum. At first I thought it was the t.v. but it wasn't on. And it kept getting louder and louder. And my heart was still racing.



2:45- I couldn't take the sound anymore so I drank a glass of water with some tylenol and got in the shower to try and cool myself off. The weirdest thing about the shower was that I couldn't tell if it was hot or cold but it felt like it was both.



3:45- Trying to rest some more and having the humming voice in my head again. So I tried to watch t.v. but it was way to loud. So I turned it down but then the hum of the t.v. was to unbearable so I turned it off. Suddenly I heard the door open and some one run in. So I went out to see who came home. No one was home\ldots  So I went back into my room freaked out by that. Then I heard the door open again. So I checked again, no one. And I could hear every single sound made around me like it was exploding in my ear. This kept going on for hours.



8:45- Finally feeling the effects ceasing slowly, my heart is starting to beat slower and I can breath normal. I don't know how my parents didn't notice me like this I was in my room for the whole night but if they would have came in to talk to me it would have been very obvious how sick I was. And I probably should have just said something with how severe that trip was because I could have at anypoint had a heart attack thats what it felt like.



11:15-I tried to sleep but I was laying for hours before I even got anything you could call sleep.



This trip has changed me forever, I will never take 9 pills of something I have never researched before or even tried. It was really scary knowing that I took way to much and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I felt like I was going to die or end up crazy. Luckily after a couple days I felt a lot better and only suffered a good reminder of how dangerous something can be if you don't know what your doing.
