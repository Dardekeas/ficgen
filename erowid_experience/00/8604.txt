 While searching for the `correct' cough medicine to use in the drug store, I noticed that they had a bottle of dietary supplement pills called Kava kava. I remembered reading about it on the internet, and thought to gave it a try. When I got home, I found that there was not much on the site I checked about kava\ldots 



-The pills were 200mg with 30\% kavalactones (60mg a pill).

-The bottle says three pills daily (180mg).

-I ate a half hour ago, a belgian waffle.



 A few other users' comments were not greatly descriptive on the amount taken, so I made a guess of 700mg of the kavalactones. Which was 12 pills\ldots  and these pills were the bigger kind, but I managed to down them and hold them easily.



 The other users' comments said that it took more than an hour to feel anything. It was 5:30 in the morning, and I had no sleep. After an hour went by, two friends and I went to a park to look around out of boredom.



 I think it started working about 2 hours later, but it was very light, if not being completely imagined. My sleepiness probably did not help, but I have been up for 24 hours before, and I do know how it normally feels like.



 It is now 12 hours later, and I have been feeling a little odd emotionally since then. Not in a bad way, but nothing much good, either. I had a stomach ache for about 30 mins a while back, definately from the pills, but it was nothing painful.



 Either kava is over-rated, needs to be mixed with something else, or requires a higher dosage. Good luck.
