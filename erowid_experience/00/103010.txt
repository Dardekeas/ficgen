This is a summary of my experiences Using Moclobemide and Recreational Drugs.



The conditions I have are Bi-polar disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder (APD). I also have a heart condition SVT. I have been on Moclobemide for over 10 years, prescribed by my psychiatrist for my Bi-polar disorder. My dose is 300mg x 4 per day. I am also prescribed 2 x 200mg of Lamotrigine daily, as a mood stabiliser. It is an anti-convulsant, but is also used as a mood stabiliser. Thought I'd share some info about my experiences using Moclobemide and recreational drugs.



A little info about Moclobemide. It is a Reversible Inhibitor of Monoamine Oxidase A (RIMA). RIMA's are a type of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) which is an anti-depressant. Moclobemide is sold under names including Amira, Aurorix and Clobemix.



Compared to traditional MAOI's, the advantages of Moclobemide are: it has no dietary restrictions, fewer side effects, has less drug interactions and much shorter half-life. In fact the half-life is so short that if changing to another type of anti-depressant you only need a day or two before switching. I chose Moclobemide as my anti-depressant because SSRIs and SNRIs pretty much stopped MDMA working at all. Couldn't have that!



I wasn't as knowledgeable about drugs when I started using Moclobemide as I now am, if I had been more educated at the time I probably wouldn't have taken the drugs listed below with Moclobemide, and I know I wouldn't be as casual about taking any recreational drugs with a traditional MAOI opposed to a RIMA.



Recreational drugs I have used while taking 1200mg a day of Moclobemide (dose taken at 600mg twice a day) are - amphetamines/speed, Ice (meth), MDMA, LSD, 2CB, 25i-NBOME (N-BOMB), marijuana as well as alcohol I think that at least some are pretty much contraindicated. I never have a `washout period', I take my usual dose of Moclobemide while using all of them.



Speed - I have used speed for 20 years, without any addiction problems at all. In fact I hold down a very responsible job in the IT department in one of Australia' biggest banks, and have done so for 15 years. While doing 12 hour rotating shifts in a 24 x 7 x 365 environment. I never, ever, use it at work, even though staying awake until 8AM and driving home in heavy traffic can be hard at times.



I genuinely use it for therapeutic reasons. It is the ONLY thing that allows me to escape my APD for a day, maybe two. If anything I would say that Moclobemide potentiates the effect of speed. I'm not looking to get high, just enough for me to feel `normal'. I generally take about 0.1 gm (a point) orally of speed, maybe once every two to three weeks. The speed is high quality, purchased from SR. Very rarely my heart condition does kick off when using it, but no worse than when not using. Never had any issues really.



I have used much larger doses when using it at dance parties, and in combination with MDMA. Still no problems at all.



Marijuana - Again I use dope for therapeutic reasons, not saying I don't enjoy it though. I have terrible dreams and dope is one of the few things that stop them. As opposed to anti-psychotics it's much the lesser evil. I used to used about 2gm a day. Now I only use (vaporise) 0.25 to 0.50 gm before bed. I have even got to the point that I don't really want it, but after one night without it, I wake up either terrified, angry and aggressive and sometimes even a little violent, as in waking up punching a pillow. I'm a very passive person by nature.



I have never had any problems what so ever combining marijuana and Moclobemide.



ICE/Methamphetamine - which I smoked. No interaction. I haven't used Ice without being on Moclobemide at the same time. But if anything I would say I got less out of it than my friends. But that is probably the reverse of what would be expected, I'd have thought Moclobemide would increase the effects.



MDMA - never any issue when combining the two. But I think I have had very slight symptoms of serotonin syndrome when coming down. I had mild uncontrollable twitching, agitation, increased pulse rate and increased body temperature, I also remember being really tense around the neck and shoulders. Serotonin syndrome is a possible outcome when combining MDMA with any anti-depressant. It can be a very serious condition. But I am on a large dose of Moclobemide and that only happened once to me and only very slightly. Put it this way it doesn't stop me using MDMA.



I have had maybe 0.2 gm of MDMA powder over a night. I have until recently usually used pills. (Thank god for SR). I have had many various pills over the years, and who knows what was in them? Plenty of MDMA, but with almost all pills plenty of other stuff mixed in too. Don't think I ever had more than 2 or 3 pills in one night, don't see the point. But I never had any issues with mixing anything so far with Moclobemide. I also often use more than one drug at once: Speed/MDMA/Marijuana.



LSD - I would have to say that for me LSD is less effective than normal. It takes me twice as much as friends use to get less effect. But no problems when used with Moclobemide apart from that.



2CB - I have taken this only twice, and always when being on Moclobemide. So a bit hard to say if the effects of 2CB are altered by Moclobemide. But I can say that I was tripping my tits off. And again no adverse reactions.



25I-NBOMe (N-BOMB) - haven't used N-BOMB without being on Moclobemide. But I seem to need a little more than everybody else. But when it does kick in, it was good. No problems combining Moclobemide with N-BOMB for me.  



Alcohol - I have really gone off booze the past year. But when I do drink I have a high tolerance and always have had. When I was manic I was going through 24 cans of beer a day for 30 days strait. So I can definitely say that I have no issues drinking while using Moclobemide.



Caffeine -  The only thing I have ever had any real problem with is energy drinks. I had to call an ambulance and go to the emergency room within a year of each other with heart issues. It wasn't my heart condition, this was different. Both occasions I'd been using various drugs, and drinking, all pretty much in moderation, and different drug combos both times. The one common factor I'm sure caused issues with my heart both times was energy drinks. The only time I ever drank them was when I was using speed with or without other drugs as well. Thought I was having a heart attack, both times was told there was nothing wrong with my blood pressure or pulse, ECG showed nothing unusual.



The above is only my personal experience, do not take the above as a green light to mix Moclobemide with the anything else. Reactions of the same drug(s) in different people can vary widely. I strongly urge you to do a little research before combining Moclobemide with any recreational drug. Especially if using any other psychoactive medication along with Moclobemide.



To sum up, Moclobemide has been a relatively safe drug for me, with few side-effects. It's been safe with all drugs I have mixed with it. BUT I do now have a physical addiction. I don't crave it or even need it mentally, however I now get `brain zaps' which extend to my whole body when I haven't taken any for 16-18 hours. It is very unpleasant. But I have been on a dose twice the recommended maximum for years. I think this might not occur if taking a smaller dose for a shorter period, but that's just a guess. Many anti-depressants have this `brain zap' effect when stopping using them for some people.
