I have been on daily doses of Zoloft (100 mg) for about a year now, and recently began experimenting with new drugs.  I first tried mushrooms, and have taken half an eighth of mushrooms three separate times.  I never experienced any hallucinations of any kind, and at most was influenced by the atmosphere into feeling slightly high or euphoric.  I even tried a half eighth of golden caps and ended up simply falling asleep on my couch without experiencing any psychedelic effects.  



After shrooms I sampled DOB, starting with a dose of two hits.  I didn't feel anything after taking those, so I tried again a few days later.  The second time I took four hits under the tongue and smoked one.  I initially felt euphoria after smoking the last hit and became very giggly.  Soon I was back to normal, but a few hours later I seemed to feel a slight amount of highness and euphoria because of the previous hits.  I never had any hallucinations though, visual, auditory, or otherwise.  



Finally, I tried LSD.  I was tired of psychedelics being ineffective, so I wanted something stronger.  First I took one hit of acid, the same dose as my friends who had experienced obvious effects.  The acid supposedly wasn't very `visual,' but just made you think differently and feel euphoric.  After the first hit I felt absolutely nothing.  About two hours after taking the first hit I took two more and smoked a large bowl of weed.  I definitely got high off the weed, but didn't notice the acid for a while.  About 45 minutes after dropping I began to feel happy and giggly, and my sense of space was distorted.  I felt the need to lay or sit down and couldn't seem to stop thinking.  I was immersed in my thoughts while I contentedly smoked a cigarette outside on the porch.  My LSD experience was quite pleasent. 



I'm certain that SSRIs interfere with hallucinations, but they don't make it impossible to trip.  I think higher doses are just required for those on SSRIs.
