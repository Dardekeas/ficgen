My parents got divorced when I was about 13. My mom wanted it, my dad and I didn't. Naturally, it shook me up a bit; and things definitely didn't help with puberty coming on and all, so whenever I was with my mom I was short tempered and irritable. I wasn't really sad, just angry I guess.



Well my mom insisted I see a therapist, and after a couple sessions I was prescribed prozac. It seemed to help; I didn't notice an increase in happiness, but I was less irritable. 



After a couple years I basically quit (almost) cold turkey, and soon after noticed that my libido was sort of out of whack. I still thoroughly enjoy the company of women, but I can't get `it' up too easy, and now I find myself confused about my sexuality and might even say that because of it, im more depressed than when I started. Anyways I did some research and apparently prozac tends to have that effect.



In conclusion: Prozac gave me moderate ED and it sucks.



0/10 would not reccomend; take a different Antidepressant
