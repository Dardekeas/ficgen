 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



Cocaine was not on the schedule for that Friday night. Another average night out with my friends, but I was driving. So I wanted something other than alcohol to get high off, namely cannabis. All times are approximate.  At the time of this experience I was 17.



At the first bar we got to I met T, an acquaintance I wasn't very familiar with. After smoking a joint in the bar garden he informed me he had some coke on him and asked whether I wanted a few bumps; I accepted. I had never done coke before but had wanted to try for some time. We went outside into some alleyway, I couldn't feel any of the effects of the cannabis; I was overcome with nerves. I guess the constant indoctrination in youth against ``hard drugs'' came into an effect as I couldn't stop shaking. I blamed it on the cold to save face.



We used a phone light to see and he offered me to go first. I used my house key to scrape up a small bump and held it up to my nose and sniffed. It didn't burn or anything. I rubbed some all over my gums and it instantly became numb, but it felt wonderful. The rush started to hit me as I was walking away after approx 2 minutes, and whenever I inhaled it felt like I was breathing ice. It felt absolutely brilliant though. My head felt like it was floating.



T+5: Me and T started chatting about random stuff and I felt a really strong bond. This never would have happened normally so I think the cocaine was taking effect. He offered me his jumper seeing I was cold, insisting I have it. I never would have normally considered him this friendly. We went back inside the bar and I felt really confident and chatty. I was meeting new people and chatting with them as if I had known them for years. My nose started to clog up which was unpleasant. Some people needed money so I offered them a lift. 



T+10 Two in the back and T in front, we took a drive to the bank machine. For some reason I insisted he have my phone holder in the shape of a driving seat, because I saw him looking at it. I don't know why I did that, because I really liked it. But at the time I felt I wanted to give someone else happiness.



T+15 I drive increasingly aggressively after we find out the first bank machine is broken. I was getting rushes and tingles down my spine. The coke made me reckless. I was driving too fast for the roads. Why could I not stop laughing? I didn't have any perception of danger, or feel any fear in my gut. Cocaine made me feel invincible. Everyone in the car was coked up and encouraging me to speed. I get in a race with a mini cooper but it was wayyy to fast for me. Although my perception was skewed, my driving skills felt at 110\%. Fast speeds felt slow to me and my reactions were quick. I am never normally an aggressive driver, but I felt the urge to go faster and faster. I'm not proud of it, but doing 120 mph down the motorway felt brilliant. I was getting such a buzz out of it. T was laughing uncontrollably. I kept burning through cigarettes, about 1 every 10 minutes. 



T+30 We got cash and got back and I was still feeling it a lot. T wanted to do more, and we looked around to buy more as we had nearly run out.



T+45 We get a gram of coke and split it, I go home. Lots of people wanted a lift, but they were too drunk and I didn't know them before that night, so I ditch them. I don't take any more coke and go straight to bed.



Morning after:



Finished off the rest of the coke in the morning, it was clearly way under half a gram. Felt fine all day, and tired for sleep. I sleep fine. Day after that didn't experience any crash or comedown.



Overall a good first experience, I liked the feeling of invincibility. But its not a drug I'll do too often.
