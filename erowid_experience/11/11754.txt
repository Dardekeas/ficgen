I ordered a packet of 25g of Argyreia nervosa (baby hawaiian woodrose)(Convolvulaceae) for Â£10 from a website that speciallises in ethnobotical seeds, cacti and chemically novel plants etc.  The seeds were an off white light yellow-brown colour approximately 3-5 mm in diameter (roughly).  As the seeds did not appear to have a `fuzzy coating' of any kind I presumed this had been removed by the supplier.  



I crushed about 30 with a nut-cracker and broke them down as best I could (i don't have a grinder) and placed the seeds in a small jar of water.  I allowed the seeds to soak for about a day and drank half the fluid (not the seed matter at the bottom - I heard this induced vommiting).  There were no apparent effects at all.  



I also tried eating the seeds - I ate about 5 (which incidentally I was able to chew with my teeth - I don't know if this is usual, I heard they should be rock hard).  Again no effects.  I don't know if I am doing something fundamentally wrong or if these are the wrong seeds.  The ethnoboticist isn't a `head shop', but comments on the seeds having `Probably the most potent vegetative source of Lysergic amide alkaloids. Current strain in stock is a West Indian variety.'  I think I'll try chewing down about 20 seeds and swallowing them - if that doesn't work I'll probably try planting them instead.
