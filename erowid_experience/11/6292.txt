     I bought what I thought was E off of what I thought was a reliable source.  I popped the little yellow emoticon stamped pill and went off to have a good time.  Later, my friend came up to me and told me he had gone and had his pill (of the same `brand') tested, and that it was negative for speed and MDA/MDMA, which I found funny, cuz I was definatly feeling \_something\_, about 45 mins after popping.  I shrugged it off, thinking that it had just been a bad test.  Within 30 minutes, I was puking.  Now, I have never puked off of an E trip.  I've had slight cases of mild nausea, but I've got a stomach or iron when it comes to this type of thing, but here I was, puking behind a couch, where i stood and in the bathroom.  After puking in random spurts for about 45 minutes to an hour, I was feeling somewhat better, despite the odd gagging fit.  However, I felt like I had eaten 5 bowls of chili and was about to loose control of my bowls, and while I never did, the feeling was obviously unpleasant.  I suppose the worst part of this little mishap was the muscle spasms.  Around the same time I was puking, which was about hour and a half after dosing, i had very extreme muscle spasma, mainly in my legs, which continued almost all night, making dancing uncomfortable and seemingliy `heavy' on my legs.  My hamstrings felt like they were going to snap.  I sat down and constantly stretched, crossed and uncrossed my legs for over an hour, and flexed my arms.  Combined with the puking, gagging, and heavy breathing, I basically sat on the couch all night, as dancing just was not my top priority.  

     

A day later (still feeling jittery and tired and like I'd run a marathon) the same friend who tested the pill contacted me.  Because of the reaction I'd had, he'd crushed up his pill to test it again with a tsting kit.  He still did not find MDMA or Speed.  SO he had gotten a different kit.  One that tested for PMA and the likes.  He had gotten a minor result for PMA.  Given the fact that I'm anemic and did have a reaction, with no results pointing to MDA/MDMA or speed like substances, all signs point to PMA.  Luckily, I only did one pill.  The only really amusing thing that came out of this little `trip' was that later in the night, I turned around after hearing noises from behind the couch in the chill room I was in, and found two people in the process of having sex in my puke.  I warned them I had puked there.  They said they were aware and that they were avoiding it, and then told me to go away, as i was `ruining the moment'.
