Here's my favorite way to ingest kava. In this recipe I use kava emptied from gelcaps containing 425mg ground kava root each. I usually empty between 20-30 gelcaps for use in the recipe, although I have done up to 60 gelcaps worth to no ill effect, outside of a drunkeness and lethergy leading into sleep. Usually, I enter a nice trance like state. My thoughts settle down and my mind grows quiet. I find kava is an excellent meditation aid. Worries shed like fall leaves. The nuerotic inner Catfish hits the pines and takes a few hours off. I become more relaxed and sociable. It also seems to have a wonderful synergy with cannabis. Several times, I have noticed this combo to produce a digital block-like effect on my visual field. Everything appears to consist of blocks, as if I was viewing the images under high computer magnification. 



While fresh root is admittedly more potent, I often find it much more convenient to just grab a bottle from the market when I am planning to `shake' things up and settle into the kava groove. Make sure to buy gelcaps and not softgels, as the latter is a pain in the ass to pop and squeeze out the kava splooge. And now, without further malarky, here's the recipe:



Add the contents of 20-30 kava gelcaps into a blender with 3 large scoops of vanilla ice cream and about 8-12 oz milk. Add a few drops of vanilla extract and a few shakes of cinnamon and blend for about 5 minutes. Simple as 1,2,3\ldots 



Of course, any ice cream flavor can be used. Milk works best at 2\% or higher. Also, the more liquidy you make the shake, the more kava powder that will settle at the bottom of your glass. Adding a teaspoon or so of vegetable oil seems to help better emulsify the kava. I find this an extremely easy, yet effective manner in which to sit and speak with the kava gods. Enjoy!
