Neurontin has been suggested for many off-label uses and it has been suggested that it is beneficial in alcohol withdrawal maintenance. This could be no further from the truth. Doctors, despite being thoroughly educated, can fall for a sales pitch just like anyone else. 



Not too long ago, I was admitted to an inpatient behavioral unit at my local hospital. It was not the first time I had been there, but was the first time being there under the new unit policies for detox patients. (The new policy being no benzos after the first 96 hrs.) So, in place of Ativan/Librium, I was immediately switched to Neurontin, which I was told would ease my symptoms. Yeah right. 



I had become a sweaty, nauseous, tingling, sleepless nightmare. I was so upset by this that I left against medical advice, figuring that I could suffer this at home just the same. I had the current dose of Neurontin in my system by the time I made it home that night \& still wound up having a nasty seizure. 



After all this happened, I spoke to a doctor who had treated me before \& was familiar with my condition. He told me that only benzos \& barbituates like Phenobarbital are useful in treating alcohol withdrawal seizures. Drugs like Neurontin, Dilantin, Tegretol, Depakote, etc. are useless to a person who's seizures aren't caused by epilepsy \& they have no benefit in treating withdrawal anxiety \& psychotic reactions that could be better managed through antipsychotics like Seroquel, Zyprexa, or Haldol.
