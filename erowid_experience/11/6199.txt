I've recently come down with allergies, which means that whenever I smoke I end up coughing and hacking. I would like to give marijuana smokers a simple alternative to ingesting cannabis without the hacking. I know there are other recipes on preparing cannabis, but I found this fast, effective and tasty!



What you need:



1 veggie burger. I used Garden Burger's Savory Mushroom. Any type will do. If you eat meat, use hamburger\ldots  A joint's amount of weed. I was lucky to have some nice bud, so I ended up using less than a joint. NOTE: Make sure you remove all seeds and stems!



Put veggie burger in microwave for about a minute. Remove. Mash veggie burger with hands or a fork. (whatever's clever) Evenly sprinkle marijuana on veggie burger. Mix and mash veggie burger \& weed. (Re)-shape into a patty. Place patty on wax paper. Place in microwave for about a minute and a half. Take out, and enjoy as you would a regular hamburger! NOTE: Weed in the microwave will give off a smell, but it's very faint and goes away after a moment\ldots   



Not only is this tasty, but I didn't cough up a lung! In my experience, it took around 30-35 minutes for the buzz to set in, (similar to LSD) but the high lasted in excess of four hours! Be prepared! I had a nice, calm, stony buzz.
