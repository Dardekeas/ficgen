I got into an argument w/my mom before I went to bed so I decided to take 3 generic Alprazolams that my friend gave me. I couldn't sleep because my bed was uncomfortable so I slept in the living room. I thought I had gotten up at one point and found my mom cleaning her room and asked her why she was cleaning so late at night. She didnt answer me so I went back to the living room. 



I looked in the mirror and freaked out cuz my face looked weird and my teeth were crooked. I ignored this and went back to my bed. I woke up thought I was in my bed and realized I was on the couch and my teeth weren't crooked and my face is ok. It was all a weird dream! I kept drifting off, falling asleep and thinking I'm walking around the house but then I hear my own voice say `Wake up!' and I wake up, but only to realize I'm still dreaming so I tell myself to `wake up or mom is gonna find you dead in here!' I finally wake up and say fuck trying to sleep. I thought I was going to die It was a little like robo-tripping. Real xanax never did that to me.
