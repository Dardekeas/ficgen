I've been on Zoloft for almost 2 months now, and I feel good.



There were a number of factors that lead to my depression. When I was younger I was bullied an awful lot, I was an outcast in my class in high school, and still have some self esteem issues. When I finished high school I began uni, and quickly realised that I hated it I went on feeling like this for 2 years. I had no friends there, and hated the course I was taking, but I kept going because I didn't want to be a disappointment to my family. I'm also very insecure, and have trouble with women and relationships in general.



All of this stuff just snowballed and became overwhelming, I'd stay up at night hating who I was, crying and feeling helpless. I began to think about suicide on a daily basis. One day I made the decision to tell my parents how terrible I felt. I came to the conclusion that I needed to leave uni for a period of time, but it didn't help. Finally I mustered up the courage to speak to my doctor and he put me on zoloft and referred me to a psychiatrist.



At first there were some side effects. For about 2 weeks I had trouble getting to sleep, and my appetite was chaotic, I lost weight because I wasn't hungry at all, but these side effects have lessened gradually. I also have a bit of trouble achieving ejaculation, I can still do it, but if I've been drinking or smoking grass it's damn near impossible to ejaculate.



I've been taking 50mg a day and feel great. Things that used to bother me just don't bother me as much any more. I haven't thought about suicide for a ages. I also have more confidence in myself, and have realised that I'm not worthless.



All in all I really have no complaints about this drug, it has worked wonders for me.
