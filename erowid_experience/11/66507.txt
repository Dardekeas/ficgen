It was around 12:38 pm when I decided to try them. I had already tried them last night but had less and still made me feel good enough to try it again. Well back to how it went. I was making a personal pizza while I ate the cloves and drank some 7up to help me get them down get rid the taste. a couple minutes late (probably like 4) I started noticing some of the effects. The effect was more the feeling of a nice but still pleasing head buzz from weed. Wehn I started eating the pizza i didn't notice the effects at all but 5 minutes after finishing it they came back.It is now 1:45pm an I'm not sure if the effect is wearing off or not but I still feel good, sort of like a good head buzz like I said before. Later if I can find some papers I'm going to grind some up and tried smoking that.
