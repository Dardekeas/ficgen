I got 25 HBWR seeds, I then used a pair of pliers to crush the seeds.  I did not remove anything from the outside of the seeds, they were used as is.  I then put the crushed seeds in a jar with about 2 cups of water.  I let the mixture sit for 36 hours, shaking occaisonally.  The water turned a nasty brownish color, but didn't smell of much.



At about 1:30 pm, `B' and I drank an equal part of the liquid and ate the remains of the seeds (leaving about a 3rd of the seed mush).  This was done on an empty stomach.  It was very mild tasting, somewhat like an oatmeal taste or something.  We then sat back smoked a joint or two and waited.  



+2 hours- we both noticed slight sensation\ldots somewhat lazy, groggy\ldots .nothing very strong.



+3 hours- noticable feeling of happiness, silly grin on face.  `trippy' sensation\ldots tightness of jaw, jittery stomach.  Very similiar to the feeling I get on LSD.  Although no visuals whatsoever.  



+5 hours- giddy, giggly and feeling different.  Nothing strong at all, but a noticable effect.  Could have been active during the experience, but was quite happy to be chilling at home listening to music and hanging out.



No nasuea or pain\ldots some gas, burping.  



Overall, we both agreed that it was quite pleasant, felt like half of a hit of a drug somewhere between LSD and MDMA\ldots I wonder what 20 seeds would feel like?  Anyway, I was skeptical about these things, but I am a convert now, and will look into other natural legal drugs of this type\ldots look in other vaults in the future, to see how I like em.



Overall grade, C+ (would have been higher but my expectations were too high)
