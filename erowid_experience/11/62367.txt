 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#  



I don't know why but one Friday night me and a couple friends decided it would be cool to ingest mass amounts of caffeine. We took 2 NoDoz each and realized it did nothing and drank some Red Bull. When we again felt nuthing we took more and I ended up taking 18 pills and drink 3 different energy drinks.



We went into a store and I felt as if I was cutting through the air and moving extremely fast when I was simply walking. We met up with other friends while there and decided to go to one of their houses. I had to make the person driving me stop and pull over so I could throw up because I felt terrible. Then I thought I was fine. But I definatley was not.



We got to the house about 2 blocks away and I began to feel extremely sick. I went outside to puke and ended up curling up in a ball and sitting in the driveway. Everything seemed so unreal at the time. I got home and threw up all night. I had nuthing in my stomach but I was just throwing up what I thought was blood or the lining of my stomach. I couldn't say anything to my mom or anyone because I didn't want to get in trouble for being so stupid.



So for the rest of the weekend I lied in bed and vomited. Finally on Sunday I stopped puking and was keeping liquid down. Mostly water because anything else burned going down because my throat was destroyed. The sick feeling last for about another 2 weeks and still to this day I can't drink energy drinks or even smell them without getting sick. I don't care what anyone says I would never touch NoDoz again.
