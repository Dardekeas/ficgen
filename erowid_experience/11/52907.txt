Okay, First of all I've been diagnosed with severe depression/insomnia.  I had been up for two nights in a row now, and it's about 7:30am.  Why waste the day, so I pop my prescribed 300mg wellbutrin for the morning.  Yep, I'm up and runnin' within 30 minutes now.  



Later that day I was bored with no narcotics at hand.  So I pop 40mg propranolol at 8:00pm (not prescribed), then 300mg more of wellbutrin, prescribed, at 8:30.  Within 45 minutes I am sweating horribly, and tweakin' like I've downed 8 cups of coffee and took some amphetamine.  This sweating is starting to irritate me so I take my shirt off and turn the fan on.  Spiders and Vinaragoons is starting to wig me out, so I play something soothing hoping for a change in mood.  



It's hard to concentrate because of my tweaking arms and pulsing heart rate.  I change the song to Bowie's `Drive In Saturday'\ldots aahhhh.  I keep  it with the Bowie tunes for a long while.  About 10:00pm I feel somewhat better, but still tweaking and my head feels warm, but a bloodrush loving type of warm.  Well to make this long story short now; day three of the insomnia occurred.  I smoked a pack of Reds/played guitar/took a shower/ and cleaned most of my room, (which was a wasteland).
