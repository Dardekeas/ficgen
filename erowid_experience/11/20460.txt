1st experience:



I came across this stuff which was described to me as `Doggy K'  The person selling it to us had gotten it from a friend who had worked in a animal hospital. 



We figured why not try it? It was being offered at a cheaper price and there was no Ketamine to be found.



I remember it was in a bottle but there was no liquid inside just a large white (or could have been yellowish) rock inside the bottle..after breaking it up a little into a  chunky powder it seemed that the more I cut it up the more it turned sticky and began to clump more, so we left it at that and put some small lines out to test.



I remember snorting a little and when it first kicked in it felt good, almost like an onset of Ecstacy but nothing more, though it felt nice, my aim was to go into a K Hole so I put out another line and snorted it. After this I do not remeber ANYTHING\ldots nothing at all



After it was all over, My friends who had stayed sober were telling me that I was being very noisy, I was jumping off the couch thinking I was a bird, I was also going up to my friend and telling him in a robotic voice that I was a robot, I also repeatedly approached him every 5 minutes saying 'hey whats up Bob I didnt know you were here, when did you get here.?\ldots .



Again, I Do Not Remember any of this.



2nd experience:



That fact that i had a Total Blackout of the night really bothered me. i was determined to remeber what the experience was like. so i got some more and a few nights later I tryed it in my room.

I woke up the next day With absolutley no recolection of the night..

I didnt think it was a drug worth persuing anymore so i got rid of it.

---------------------

Looking it up on the internet it seems people use this drug.

I wonder why?

Maybe i just did to much?

Maybe it is meant to be used in very small doses.?

From what my friends told me of the night..the experience seems to be more closely related to an Angel Dust high then it is to the Ketamine experience.



I dont think i will ever try Telazol again.



Be Safe people.Be Smart

Research your drugs before you do them\ldots .
