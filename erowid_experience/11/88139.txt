\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#





[Erowid Note: The following report documents the ingestion of an unusually high and potentially dangerous dose of MDPV. It is possible that the `White Rush' material described was not pure MDPV. We have chosen to include this report to help document the dose range, but its inclusion does not imply that this dose is safe.]





4:30 PM: At this time my friend and I have purchased and are ready to insufflate 125mg each of MDPV (Sold as White Rush). The White Rush is sold in 250mg packages so we thought it would be best to just split a pack. After only about 3-5 minutes later I could begin to feel the chemical. I suddenly had the urge to walk somewhere; I couldn't stand still. Then for the next 15 minutes was the coming up phase of the chemical, and I could literally feel every minute becoming happier and having more energy.





5:00 PM: I was already at the plateau, however, it was not going anywhere anytime soon. Snorting this much gave me a very similar feeling of ecstasy. My mind was going at a hundred miles an hour, I was very easily distracted by even the smallest things, I could not stop talking, textures felt great, and I felt as if I was the happiest person in the entire world. These feelings all were going to last for quite some time.





6:45 PM: The feelings of ecstasy had started to wear off for me, however, I still felt as if I was coming off of a line of coke. At this point we are ready to have the ecstasy feeling back again so we go buy more and make ourselves a small line. This time several other of our friends join in and we all snort about a 75 mg line.


7:00 PM: Just arrived at a local bar with the same friends, the feelings of being very social, very happy, and rubbing everything in sight had returned already. Everyone is about on the same page, which makes all of us having conversations virtually impossible. In a surrounding such as a bar I found it a lot easier to be distracted. A thousand thoughts were flying through my head at any single moment. However, this time I did not feel the need to have to get up and walk. Although I wanted to get up and talk to people around the bar, I was perfectly content sitting in my chair.





10:00 PM: This is about the time when everything goes south. Little did I know at this point, that the more I redose on MDPV it exponentially adds time to how long it's going to last. However, at about this time I went from being the happiest person in the world to somewhat of a zombie. I was not nearly as happy as I was earlier in the day or even a few hours prior. The want to talk to everyone around me had completely disappeared. In fact, I didn't want to talk to anyone besides my friends at the same table as me. Being the na√Øve person I am, I thought ``let's do another line to be happy again''\ldots unfortunately it does not work that way.


10:45 PM: Because of our sudden decrease in mood my buddy, that had did a line with me the first time, and I go out to his car for the third line of the day. Again, this was about 75mg.  I knew when it came to 10:50 or even 11:00 and I wasn't any happier that I shouldn't have done that third line.


11:15 PM: I am almost completely zombied out. My speech was starting to become monotone, I had no interest in talking with anyone, and I was staring off into space. This is when we decide to leave the bar and head home.





11:45 PM: After all the complaining I'm doing because the last line didn't do anything for me, another friend of mine offers me about a 50 mg line back at home. So, again, looking for my now bad mood to go away and something to pick me up, I take it.


12:15 AM: I am staring off into nothingness, it is now impossible to hold a conversation with anyone, I was giving one word answers to questions. My head felt completely scrambled, I could not generate a complete sentence in my head. And if I tried to, it came out making no sense. 


2:00 AM: I felt like I was so coked out that I could do nothing besides sit back in a recliner and stare. My pupils were huge and I couldn't close my eyes for the life of me. I wanted to go to bed really bad but at this point it was impossible.


4:30 AM: Realized I had been messed up on this stuff for 12 hours. 


6:00 AM: Sun was starting to come up and I had no choice but to watch it. Still wide awake, and now pissed off because all I wanted was bed.





4:00 PM: It wasn't until this time that even as hard as it was for me to close my eyes, that I could actually keep myself asleep for a half hour. After the nap, I wake up and still feel jittery and very very tired but I could make sense out of what I was trying to say a lot easier. When I wake up, realize this stuff had me messed up for 24 hours.


10:00 PM: Yes, that's right. It was not until 10 PM the next day that I actually fell asleep.





Final Notes: I believe MDPV would be very fun to use in controlled amounts. My first line was an absolute blast, however, it should have been there that I stopped. I found that my body seemed to have a very quick tolerance to the chemical and that is what caused me to fiend. Each time I redosed on the chemical it had a less effect. Also the more I ingest, the longer it will last. It seemed to be similar to ecstasy in higher doses and similar to coke on smaller doses. Very fun chemical, however, as much as you think you want to, do not redose in the same night.
