It was about one or two on a sunny afternoon as me and two of my friends sat, crammed into a small Suburu, in a deserted church parking lot.  This was in the infancy of my weed smoking days, and I wasn't quite sure I was ready for mushies.  My friend, Alucard I'll call him, had already done mushrooms several times and wanted to try smoking them to see what sort of effect it had.  I decided to go along with it since we hadn't been able to get any chron that day.  Alucard broke out his bong and we started ripping dry bowls.  The smoke was almost undetectable in my throat until I had inhaled too much and then coughed it all out.



After we had finished that eigth Alucard decided he didn't want to waste any more of his mushies, so he gave me and our other friend each a cap and a few stems to eat, in hopes of stimulating some sort of effect.  After a little bit, I don't remember how long exactly, I started to feel something.  It felt like I was really really stoned.  I had an incredible body high; it just felt great to sit there and not move at all.  I was so relaxed that my body was on the verge of sleep, but I kept telling myself that I needed to stay awake to experience this.



As I looked out the windows at the surrounding trees and plants I began to feel a vast amount of appreciation for them.  I was both ecstatic and amazed that something like a tree could exist.  Just the fact that it was there was like the greatest thing ever.  I looked to my left and began admiring the dumpster that was there.  It was a plain, brown, garbage dumpster.  But I noticed all the little scratches, nicks, and marks on it.  I started to wonder `How did each individual scratch get there? And what was the person who put it there like?'  I began imagining the people who could've done that, and I was fascinated by them.  This wasn't represented visually at all, but rather on a more subconscious level.  Kind of like daydreaming I think.



So while I was busy feeling incredible appreciation for life, my other two friends didn't seem to be experiencing much at all.  It was decided that smoking them was not really worth it, when you could just eat them and trip out much harder.
