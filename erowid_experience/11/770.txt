 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 

Me and a couple of friends had gone out and looking for some fun since we were bored. We came across apartments and decide to do freon since one of my friend has. I was the first to try it that day, one of my friend kept watch out and i inhaled the sugary air(freon) till i felt amazingly dizzy.. then i had trouble getting up.. soon i began to see things move farther away but my eye sight was alright. My heart begin to beat rapidly faster and faster and faster.. I felt incredably happy and all i could do was smile like a clown, then i lost balance and i fell to the ground smiling amazingly. My hearing was odd.. it was like closeing your ears then poping, so every word or sound every other second. It all lasted about 25 to 30 seconds. We all took 5 more little trips each then when we were all okay we went home a little tired but fine. 

Its worth trying once.
