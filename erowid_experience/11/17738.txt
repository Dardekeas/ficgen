Recently, I was at the dentist, and I was going to call somone to give me a ride home.  But I decided to walk home for some reason, despite it being a pretty long walk.  During that walk home, I stumbled across a beautiful Datura Inoxia plant.  I immediatly picked a thorn apple and a few flowers.



I tried smoking some Datura flower with Cannabis.  At First, I noticed nothing but the Cannabis high.  Then as I walked around, I relised that I did feel different, when I walked, my body moved a little more drunkenly, and colors seemed alot brighter, especially the sunset, and plants.  I also seemed to have an extra mood lift that made me want to act strange, or laugh.



Then just before bed, I boiled a half a flower in a cup of water.  It wasn't very bad tasting at all.



What an amazing night of sleep, I had tons of dreams, some I don't remember, others I do.  And I remember several times during the night, somone opening my door and walking into my room, but apparently, noone ever opened my door.  Most of the dreams I had took place in my house, so maybe it was an OBE.



Extremely Light Doses of Datura before bed are perfect for inducing lucid dreams or OBE's.  I was amazed at the results I got.



I've read that some people wake up in the morning with a Datura hangover, and just feel like crap.  But I guess that's only when you take high doses, cause I felt fine this morning.  In fact, I feel great this morning.



Just remember don't take too much, cause it can kill you.
