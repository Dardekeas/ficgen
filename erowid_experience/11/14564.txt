I call it a crazy combo because whenever you mix alcohol with a sedative / hypnotic, you may be digging your own grave.



Of course, that's just people who take it to excess amounts. As for myself, on a real mellow evening, there's nothing more enjoyable than taking a couple Xanax tabs and tipping back a few beers. But you've got to know your limit. Usually, with the right pills, it just feels so good and the alcohol just makes it feel so much better\ldots  till before you know it, you're blacked out and doing all sorts of crazy shit you will never remember.



I have been in this state before, and it's not fun (of course it was fun at first!). Blacking out, vomiting, or experiencing extreme dizziness is usually one or two steps below slipping into a coma or worse. So here's the point of my story\ldots . try this sometime, and you'll see why I like it so much. Be careful though, it becomes addicting, and habitual intake of alcohol and pills can really fry your liver.



Here's the suggested dosage:

In a very mellow, controlled setting (such as a campfire) take two or three Alprazolam (Xanax) 0.5mg tabs or up to one and a half 1mg tabs. 0.5mg tabs are usually an off-pink color, while the 1-mg tabs (the best) are usually a deep blue. Chase the pills with a LITE beer, sipping slowly. Don't drink to fast or too much\ldots  unless you wanna wake up the next morning covered in your own vomit, hearing stories from your friends about crazy things you did. Drink no more than two beers per hour. Even after drinking just one beer after taking Xanax, you will definitely feel the effects at the onset (20-30 min). (Note: Beer and Xanax are the perfect two substances for coming down from coke or crank)



Usual effects after 3-4 beers (although this depends on the person's body weight): Giddyness, warm rushes throughout the body, extreme euphoria, flushed skin, jelly-like feeling in the legs. 



Comedown effects: same as above but with decreasing intensity. Deep sleep usually follows within 3-4 hours. 



Negative effects (but only if you overdo it): vomiting, blackouts, delirium, hallucinations, coma, overdose, death.



be careful!!!!
