 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:LACED\_CANNABIS\#\# 



Background: I smoke cannabis regularly. I'm used to being baked out of my mind. I'll often go bowls beyond what my friends are up for, regardless of whether we're smoking mids or dank, or if we're smoking from a joint or a bong. I've had closed-eye visual hallucinations from mary jane before, and I've passed out after a boatload of bong hits and brownies. Never in my life have I experienced a high as intense or frightening as I did last Monday.



It was midnight. School approached in the morning, and I knew I would have to sleep now if I wanted to be able to get up early without a problem. However, I was feeling unusually energetic. I did what I normally do when I suffer from insomnia. I reached for the drawer that contains my stash. I had just finished my last bag, and so I reached for the new bag of dank that I had bought the other day. Because I was smoking inside, and through a spoof, I pinched off the tiniest nug I could. It couldn't have been more than .1 grams. I broke it up, and loaded it into my small glass piece. I held the lighter over the bowl and inhaled sharply. There was a certain unexpected harshness. I coughed it out through the spoof and crawled back to my bed. 



I sat down in front of my laptop, ready to watch a psychedelic video on youtube before I the drowsiness set in. I began to feel extremely high. At first, I was pleased. My dealer had really come through this time. My heart began to pound furiously. I remained calm; this phenomenon was nothing new. I assumed at the time that it was just the sativa kicking in. The pounding in my chest intensified to a level that was surprising and unpleasant. I closed my eyes. That's when I heard the music. Intense, loud rock music was shredding its way through my brain. This was upsetting, since I knew for a fact that there was no music playing in my room. I tried to calm my mind. My mind didn't listen. 



A buzzing, grating energy filled my mind and made me unable to think. I remained on my bed, mostly due to the fact that I had lost my ability to move. I fell into a strongly dissociative state. The music crashed all around me. It, and the energy coursing through my skull, were the only things I could feel. I lost track of space and time. I lost track of the position of my body. I felt as though I were drifting. At this point I had some mild visual hallucinations, but nothing more than what good bud can produce. My heart was beating so hard that I thought it would burst. I slowly returned to my body and to my sense of reality. I was sweating bullets and shaking nervously. It was the first time I was able to register anything at all in my mind after I started tripping. I realized, in horror, that there must have been something other than marijuana in that bowl.



I went over the possible drugs in my mind. I remembered cocaine and thought that my heart beat might have been an indicator of this. However, I then recognized my dissociated state for what it was, and I began to brainstorm drugs that could do that so powerfully. The first that occurred to me was \emph{Salvia divinorum}, but this seemed unbelievable for several reasons. The primary reason is that it takes more than the amount I smoked to be as high as I was. The second is that I didn't think Salvia caused increased heart rate and blood pressure. I finally settled on what I believe now to be the likeliest candidate: PCP. Less than a second after I decided on this, I started tripping again, and harder.



Everything that happened the first time happened the second time, except with greater force and in a more terrifying way. I then slipped back into a state of mental clarity. And then I would trip again. I alternated between these states until about 3:00 or 4:00 am, when I finally fell asleep. It has been almost a full 48 hours since this experience and my heart is still beating irregularly. My mind still feels buzzing -- simultaneously powerful and impotent. I have been shaky and have been unable to experience a full range of emotions over the past two days. Of course, it may never be possible to know what was in that little piece of weed. It's possible that it was just extremely potent bud. I do not believe that for a minute, though. The experience was too intense and the long-term effects are too pronounced to be the result of only cannabinoids. I am convinced that my weed was laced with something, and based on the current evidence I suspect that mystery substance to be PCP, one of the few hallucinogenic drugs I had never planned on trying.



The moral of this story is to never trust someone who sells a black market commodity too much. Without the quality control afforded to legal goods, there is always a risk of something unexpected in your product. I plan on switching dealers and laying off the grass for a while, to let my mind recuperate.
