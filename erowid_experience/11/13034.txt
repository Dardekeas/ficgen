 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



I was only 15 when I had begun to feel the impact of peer-pressure. Everyone around me was getting high from one thing or another and I wanted to find out what the fuss was about. I had tried marijuana before but it had no effect on me (I inhaled and exhaled as if I was smoking a cigg). So a friend of mine suggested huffing some gasoline. It sounded like an OK idea so off to the garage we went.



We spotted the gas can and began our 4 foot journey to our bright red can of enlightenment. It had a nozzle on it that was about a foot long. It was very dirty and it looked like it had been used a million times for various intended purposes.



I wasn't sure what to do so I simply placed my lips around the nozzle and inhaled violently a few times. The effect hit me hard and fast. Blurred vision, very light-headed and the desire not to move. It only lasted but a few minutes but I loved those few minutes. They were filled with thoughts that made no sense whatsoever. So I decided to give it another shot, but this time I was going to put my heart into it. I placed my bright red lips around the nozzle and this time I inhaled deeper, harder and faster then before. The next thing I knew I was half conscious on the floor crawling around, lost in those same strange thoughts. I hadn't noticed that I had pulled that gas can down with me and I was lying in a pool of gasoline. Then I blacked out again and woke up about an hour later.
