Hmmm\ldots  how to start this off\ldots 



I never done any hard drugs\ldots  in fact, 1999 was the first time I tried any hash.  I used to toke pretty regularly, but I never mixed it with anything.  I had a friend that had access to Zoloft, a drug similar to Prozac.  He told me that if I took a pill and smoked later, I would be in for a trip\ldots   



Considering myself a `psychonaut', I agreed to this for experimental purposes.. I was well aware of the risks\ldots  I know everything about this\ldots 



12:00pm\ldots  I took in a pill from his Zoloft pack\ldots  felt nothing at all hours later.  It's 3:00pm\ldots  decided to take another.  



Ok\ldots  6:00pm\ldots  two pills of Zoloft already working, although I wasn't aware of it\ldots 



Sometime during that evening me and the ZoloftMan hooked up with our friend, Asshole, and he had a nice J already rolled.  We smoked out, and me bein the hit-hog that I am, I had most of it.  Almost right after I finished takin my hits\ldots  it started to occur to me that everything was 10 million times more intense.  



     We were in an apartment my band uses as a jam room.  I remember walking out of the main room into the hallway, and then blinking and finding myself back in the room, totally seated and everything.  This freaked me out.  I started to tell Z-man about the feelings I was having.  He said he knew everything I was talking about.  He got on the drumset, and each time he kicked the bass drum, I felt a wave of electricity through my body.  This was definitely not a hash high.



    We left the J-room, and Z-man got me in his car, strapped me in, said `Close your eyes\ldots . Listen to the music.'  I did\ldots  and what a trip.  I could feel the car moving\ldots  I felt like I was flying, felt the wind in my hair, on my face.  The music was totally speaking to me.  Z-man was a real close friend of mine\ldots  I remember thinking about how I can trust him with everything\ldots  he totally had my mind in his hands at this point.  The song `No Good' by Prodigy came on, and I felt the synths in that song as if they were speaking to me.  I cant describe it.  I was full blown tripping.  Z later told me that my eyes where rolled up and shaking\ldots  a sign of the REM state of sleep.  I was totally tripping.  I saw things\ldots  and the cool thing is HE was orchestrating everything in my mind\ldots  He would tell me and I would see.  Painting in my brain.  It was amazing.  Then He started tapping his fingers on my head to the rythm and `walking them around my head' like a spider.  I saw water\ldots  and every tap of the finger was a splash, and it was all rippling\ldots  then I started imagining spiders on my head, so I told him to stop\ldots 



     After, that, `Poison' came on, and I saw a tunnel\ldots  and it was surrounded with musical notes, and they were all spiralling inside the tunnel, like it was a whirlpool, then I saw myself runing into it\ldots  It was great.  The car felt like a rollercoaster.



      I kep tripping my balls off, and then Z man told me to open my eyes for a minute.  I did, and I found that the car was still parked right outside the J room.  It was there the whole time!  He diidn't even move yet!!  Time distortions?  I dont know.  



     After the ride, he drove me home\ldots  and he parked outside my house and waited for me to finish tripping.  It was great.  He didn't try to snap me out of the trance.  He just stopped and waited for me to `finish'.  I got myself home\ldots .. fell asleep\ldots  not easily.  Too many thoughts raced through my head.  I woke up feeling great.  Virtually no headache no hangover\ldots  But I kep thinking about the trip.  Emotional intensity\ldots  it's unbelievable.  



     In conclusion, I wouldn't really recommend doing this if you don't know what you're doing.  If you do, and can measure the dosage and stuff, then try it\ldots  But dont get caried away\ldots  I seriously doubt doing that again\ldots  No..no\ldots  definitely not.  But it WAS the biggest learning experience of my life.  I really learned from it.  And Z-man\ldots  When it comes to substances, you're always my man\ldots  I know I can trust you with my state of mind.  Thanks.



`I got the Poison\ldots  i got the Remedy!!'
