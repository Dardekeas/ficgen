Substance: MCPP

Expierence: Second or third time

Setting: At home

Gender: Male



The amount I took could very well have been a few grams if I compare the strength of the trip I had with all the other piperazines I have tried. (BZP, TFMPP, MEOPP, PFPP)





22:20 



Swallowed a pill containing mCPP with some water to chase it down. The thing gives me a really bitter taste while it didn't even touch my tongue. Just the way good E should be. I found a picture of a pill with the same logo on pill reports but the one I took was a clean white pill without the colored speckles. The pink hearts are the same crap. I know because I've done them too.



23:00



Getting a little nausea. Starting to feel effects come on very gradually. Nothing enjoyable. Also a hot-cold feeling with chills. This stuff is weird and not in the slightest way recreational. My pupils are dilated. Ok, I know it's not going to get any better. The opposite is more true. I put my finger as far as I can but my puke-reflex doesn't seem to respond. Yet another useless, disturbing high. Almost as if this stuff was made for making people sick. I have absolutely no interest in doing anything except for maybe writing this. And my thought patterns keep getting weirder and weirder. It's like my brain isn't able to decide whether I am feeling cold or hot. Kind off like an extreme temperature of both at once.



23:25



Feeling more hot than cold now but both are still present. I'm still sick. Very confusing stuff. How can this drug have such strong resemblance to mdma but still suck so much? There is no euphoria, just blah. The previous time I did this I felt little empathy and also relaxed after feeling completely sick. Maybe because I took 2 then or maybe there's just a small amount of mdma in those pink hearts. Doesn't matter, they still suck. This stuff has a way to disgust me from whatever my senses are picking up.

Television is the devil in this case. The more familiar it is, the more it freaks me out. Even the subtitles! To me, that's the worst about this drug. Almost the opposite of ecstacy. I really hate this feeling. I've got some minor jaw friction, teeth clenching.



23:40



I'm smiling but I don't feel happy. It makes me almost emotionless, numb. But it's weirder than that. My nausea's still going strong. Victoria's secret looks like it would interest a guy but I seem to show more interest in all the shiny things and flashy lights. But that could be just me. Lust is really weird now. I rather avoid it. Still I'm glad I don't feel as sick as the previous time. I hate this drug. If you're like me and want to try every drug at least once in your lifetime I'll tell you to skip this one. Nobody deserves this feeling of sickness injected in their soul. Visually it's like a light dose of mdma. That's the only similarity however.



00:00



I feel my nausea becoming less bad. I still feel this unbalanced temperature. Not hot or cold yet both at the same time. Was I really going to sell this stuff so more people can have this god-awful trip? I think I might just know someone. I dislike looking at people's faces more than ever right now. My thoughts make weird jumps and water gives me cold chills. Time has slowed down. This stuff is the worst philosophical bullshit ever. I don't feel relaxed or more anxious than I usually do.



00:30



Well, these effects aren't getting worse. But my writing is - CPP? See pipi? I think I see a toilet that I'm going to flush these in.



01:10



I don't feel happy but I'm smiling? Funny things make me smile. How is funny and happy related? What's a 5-htp receptor agonist? Wait, I know a 5-htp receptor but what's an agonist? I'll look it up.



Hmm. It's not there. The closest is\ldots 



Agonize, Agony\ldots 



\ldots Ooh, that's bad\ldots 



Yes, that's what this drug is doing alright. I hope those aren't related.



02:00 or something 



I feel ok again. The effects are still present but the worst effects are gone now. So now I'm just bored. That's why I'm going to drink now. I pour out a glass of hard liquor. And do something I like. I watch this year's Norwegian finals of jesc. But first another glass.



06:00



I ended up drinking the whole bottle.



07:20



I go to sleep.



The next day I felt okay except for a headache and I felt kind off down when I started drinking again in the evening because I was getting drunk again for three days in a row.



Good Night
