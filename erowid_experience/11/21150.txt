After reading the `very' few scattered, yet positive reports online regarding this substance, I was very much looking forward to trying a relatively unknown phen..Since receiving my shipment, I have since taken 2C-C with a friend about 5 times, and I have to say that I'm less than impressed, and my friend agrees with me. The highest dose we ever did was 55 mg.(30 mg., with a 25 mg. booster at about 1 hour after the original effects were felt).



At this dose, and at every other dose I have tried, I don't feel the effects are particularly `comfortable' in the body (like they are with 2CI, MDBD, MDMA ect)..It feels more forced, like `ok I'm high, it feels wierd in my body, so what, and when is it going to end?'..The body sensations aren't particularly negative either, just not particulally positive, sensual or otherwise..There were no positive(any?) mental effects either. Nor was music enhanced . I never got any visuals off this, even though one report in PIHKAL claims visuals at 40 mg.



I have gained absolutly no benefit from this molecule whatsoever, and I wonder what to do with the rest of my supply? I have read one good report about combining it with 2CI, so I'll probably try that combo. But on it's own, I see no reason to do it again, as we don't particularly like the effects (although it beats being hit in the head with a bag of bricks!). I feel that `maybe' there could be more to experience at higher levels, and I'm sure I'll be forced to explore that some day, but why bother when there are MUCH better phen's available that are fully active at 15 mg?



YMMV
