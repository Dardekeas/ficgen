A little background:

For the past 2 years I have been addicted to vaious opiates, namely heroin. Recently, my parents forced me into a buprenorphine (Subutex) detox program. Over the course of three weeks I tapered from 16mg or bup to 2mg. According to my doctor I was to wait ten days and then begin a daily 50mg dose of naltrexone (a potent opioid antagonist, aka. blocker). 



My experience:

T 0:00 It had been eight days since my last bup dose and in order to leave my house my parents required me to begin the naltrexone. I felt it had been long enough and took half a pill to test it out.



T 0:30 I felt fairly normal and left home for a friends house.



T 0:45 I began to sweat. It didn't suprise me because I usually sweat a little.



T 1:00 I arrived at my friends house and was feeling a bit edgy like the beginning of opiate withdrawal. My buddy offered me three 1mg xanax pills which I swallowed immediately. These had no noticeable effect.



T 1:30 My entire body was sweating and my stomach was killing me. I believe the discomfort was more from the naltrexone itself and not opiate withdrawal. Opiate withdrawal is much more intense.



T 2:00 After talking with my friends for a bit I was feeling too uncomfortable to stay any longer and left for home.



T 3:00 Once I got home and tried to rest awhile I remembered that I could overpower the naltrexone by administering large amounts of opiates. Well, I gave that little thought before injecting 2 bags (approx. 60mg) of heroin intramuscularly.



T 3:30 All of the uncomfortable physical symptoms have subsided. I am not high, but feel back to baseline. I know that I will not be able to sleep one my own and therefore take an Ambien CR. This put me to sleep.



T 12:00 Upon waking I feel rested without the usual grogginess associated with Ambien.



T 13:00 I decided to test the effectiveness of the so called naltrexone blockade by injecting another three bags (90mg) of heroin. This puts me at ease and I feel slightly high. If I were to inject another two bags I'm sure I would get that warm comforting hug that only heroin can give me.



Conclusion: It is possible to overcome the blockade produced by naltrexone. However, all sources I have consulted advise strongly against it. Several weeks prior I injected two bags (60 mg) of heroin and got very very high. This leads me to believe that the seven bags I used over the course of this experience would have killed me if not for the naltrexone. I am sceduled to receive a Vivitrol (380mg, 1 month time release naltrexone) shot in a few days. I will not try this same experiment with the shot as I'm sure it would take a massive dose of heroin and would probably kill me.
