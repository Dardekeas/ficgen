After many experiences over the years with both `street narcotics' and pharmaceuticals I found myself regularly taking between 150mg and 300mg of Codeine extracted from Tylenol 3 tablets. Maybe once or twice a week I would enjoy this. On the specific night in question I ingested the 250mg of Ephedrine and half an hour later as effects were starting to be noticable I decided to also take the 300mg of Codeine. 



At about 1 hour after taking the Ephedrine and half hour after ingesting the Codeine I was feeling very warm and complacent. Fifteen minutes later I was sweating profusely and unable to ignore myself heating up. I had two glasses of water which seemed to help. I proceeded to watch a movie with my partner while I enjoyed the trip. At times I was manic, not able to sit still and constantly chattering as though `speeding' on amphetamines. At other points I would lapse into a dazed sort of state.



At the two hour mark I was shakey and could not walk without somewhat drunken appearance. Body tingling and quite euphoric I lay down to enjoy the trip. My speech was clear but I found myself mumbling, unable to speak above a whisper as though my chest was very heavy. It's at this point that the Codeine really took hold and I felt as though floating in a warm bath. I felt very peaceful if not somewhat detached. 



The experience lasted about 6 hours from start to finish with it just fading off quite nicely. I found my breathing very labored for the peak of the trip and at points had to conciously force myself to breathe deeply to avoid panting. 



I have not read any data about this combination of drugs so I would say that caution is the best route. The difficulty I found with my respiration would probably prevent me from attempting this combination again although seperately I adore both compounds and have had no ill effects.



Play safe.
