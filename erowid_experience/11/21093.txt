I have been taking Ritalin for 3 years now, all that time I have never abused it. But I had an exam, and I needed to stay up late. So I took 2 15 mg pills (I was always trustworthy so I kept the Ritalin in my room) crushed them up into a fine powder, and snorted then.



The burn was bad, but nothing too serious. After I was done, I remember thinking `Damn, it didn't work. Little did I know I'd have to wait for the drip (which was the nastiest tasting thing ever) to feel anything. I thought it be great. I could study, get a good grade, and pass my class.



Wrong! At first it was O.K. Mild euphoria, peaceful, etc\ldots  But every drug has its dark side. I was snapped back to reality real fast. 



First it started when I could feel my heart beating like a lab rat's, I swear, I thought I was gonna die. I tried to calm down and played `GTA Vice City' (I forgot about studying). No use, still felt like my chest was about to explode. 



Finally, I said `fuck it' and tried to sleep. HA! Not one fuckin wink. Then, as sudden as it started, it stopped. It was around 2:00 (I snorted the pill around 12:00). I finally got some shut-eye.



The next day I was the mean as ever. I felt tired, cranky and wanted to snort another line. I never did though, and I finally got out of that phase (and I didn't pass the exam).



Methylphenidate is one powerful, and I think my experience was one of a kind. It was 24 hours in hell for me.
