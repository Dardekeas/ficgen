I recently became curious about legal highs, so I ordered 1oz. of Wild Dagga and 1oz. of Salvia. First I smoked a joint of the Dagga, I got no effects so I rolled another joint, after this one I got a very slight, unsatisfied buzz that lasted about 10mins. I was very disappointed and went into the Salvia with low expectations. I loaded a small bowl and took it all in one hit, the next thing I know I am lying on my bed completely sober, but confused, I realize I have just spent the last two minutes laughing, nothing was funny, it was almost more like stomach convulsions than laughter.



I go to the bathroom and check the mirror to make sure I am still who I was five minutes ago. I decide to do it again properly, this time with MUCH more respect. I turn the lights out in my room, turn the music off, and light a candle intending to blow it out after I smoked and trip in total darkness. I load a large bowl, I was going to do two or three consecutively this time, I sit back on my bed in a position that allowed me to lay down quickly if need be. 



Here goes\ldots  I expel all the air from my lungs and take the entire bowl in one hit, then things started to get crazy, I see some sort of wave approaching rapidly from the front of my bedroom enveloping everything it crossed, I was worried but realized there was no escape so I set the bong down and hurriedly knocked over the candle as if horrible things would happen if there was light in the room. As the `wave' reached the point in my room where I was I felt it hit me, it hit my left shoulder first and this was when I got really worried `cause my shoulder disappeared into it, I would have done anything to go back in time and not smoke the Salvia. As it reached my head I felt it hit me like a freight-train, it literally knocked me sideways onto my bed, I closed my eyes to hide from it, I knew it was about to show me things I may never recover from, but felt as if it couldn't hurt me if I kept my eyes closed. Closing my eyes was a mistake, this was when I lost all touch with any form of reality, complete ego-death, I am pretty sure it wasn't a blackout. 



When I came to enough to remember that this was all happening because I had smoked Salvia I became very frightened that I had gone too far this time, it was like Salvia was some evil spirit that had tricked me, I actually believed I no longer had a physical self. The best way to describe it was like I had become a part of some ancient Egyptian wall and would be stuck there forever, it was a terrible feeling. A decade or so passed and I realized there may be a way to escape (basically I remembered my eyes) I opened my eyes and looked around, not as freeing as I had hoped, the place I was in slightly resembled the room I had left but there was alot more of everything, there were no walls and everything had changed into something else that I could not make sense of. 



At some point I realized my physical self may have returned, only I didn't know where it was. I tried moving my arms, I figured that if I could see my arms move that that was where I was, another bad idea, all that happened was that I saw things moving around below me which terrified me. I then remembered that the trip was only supposed to last a couple minutes. 



I spent the rest of the trip with my blanket pulled up to my neck for protection, clutching it for dear life with my eyes wide in fear, praying that I would be able to ride it out and get back home. I `sobered' up and spent the next twenty minutes in dumbfounded awe of the sheer power of Salvia. The trip had exhausted me so I fell asleep for two hours then spent the rest of the day reflecting and trying to figure out what exactly had happened. I can honestly say that this was a life-changing experience, I had a new found respect for life and decided I should stop wasting mine and make the most of it.



I will never do Salvia again but am glad for the experience.
