\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\#



[Erowid Note: The `2-3 cans' per `session' is a very large amount of butane and the author is unclear how long it took to inhale that much.  This is a very dangerous level of use and there are cases in which a single lungful of butane has caused death. (documentation pending, march 2005)]





a few years back iwas really enjoying life, casual drug use - smoking pot, chemicals at the weekends. then i embarked on a 4 year college course during which i was to be random drug tested, for the first few months i survived well without even drinking then i started getting bored and figured that gas (butane lighter refil) would be undetectable in drug tests. 



Occasional cans increased to 2-3 cans in a session, maximum 3-4 sessions a week a few years into the course, halucinations good and pleasant to start with, no adverse phsycological effects, but as time went by things got scarier and scarier and i could be quite shaken by some of my visions at times (ghosts of the living and the dead, pseudo religous experiences, visions of heaven and hell etc) - still didnt stop, this was purely escapism from my mundane existemce that i had brought upon myself. 



Eventually I started drinking heavily to avoid blasting gas and now im ok again - at least i dont do any drugs regularly (not even alcohol). no more gas ever again 4 me for i am still psychologically scarred by the life changing experiences which i had - ultimately for the worst - dont know if i will ever be fully back to `normal' but im trying every day. 



to conclude these words i say to anyone who reads this to avoid solvent abuse entirely - or suffer the consequences for the rest of your life. Word to the wise - get high on life (reality) - over and out.
