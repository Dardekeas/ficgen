One day I was very bored getting some fish and chips at the local Chinese shop. I went across the road to a dairy to get a red bull (I had already drunk three that day). While inside the shop I saw a rack of legal highs (Common in New Zealand but the shop has since removed them). I asked their effects and picked one out called `hypnotic' It said on the packet that it was a relaxing yet high energy buzz. I pick my fish and chips up and went home.



8:00pm - I take 2 pills and play battle field for about an hour. No effects.



9:00pm - I take 1 more pills. No effects.



10pm - Feeling like I had been scammed out of \$20 I take another pill. Then after about an hour I feel very relaxed like everything is so soft and content.



10:30pm - I feel I can do everything better! I start doing the house work. Then I feel I cannot breath I feel like I am going to die. I talk to my friend on MSN he tells me to take a walk. I try breath fresh air. It comes in waves I feel fine then like I am going to meet my death.



11:00pm - I get help from my mum tells me the same thing to relax and wont drive me to the emergency room.



2:00am - She drives me to the emergency room because I cannot walk and am crying out in pain and screaming that I am dying. I legitimately feel like I am going to die. I begin to relax in the car then I start having muscle spasms. At this point I cannot breath (We are about 5mins away from the E.R)



I am placed in a wheel car in the E.R and left in the waiting room. I feel relaxed now and safe. I begin to sober up. I am checked out and sent home at this point everything seems slow and time seems freezed. I stumble to my room and try sleep everything is spinning around slowly. I wake up about 12 times during the night feeling like I am dying. I power vomit 4 times.



For about 3 days after the experience I felt very depressed and `odd' sort of out of place not myself. I just wanted to be with my girlfriend and loved ones I had a new outlook on life felt that I would never use drugs again ( A week later I used san pedro)



It would have had to been the worst experience of my life and left me with anxiety issues for months later.
