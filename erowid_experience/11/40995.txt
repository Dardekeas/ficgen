I've used a lot of psychedelic drugs, including LSD, mescaline, DXM, DMT, LSA, shrooms, etc., etc.; I've also used a lot of tranquilizers and anti-psychotics (Ativan, Clonapin, Valium; Seroquel). I feel very qualified to analyze psychotropic effects of drugs.



Looking for something to combat anxiety attacks and insomnia (instead of benzodiazepams) I picked up some Valerian Root powder (in 450mg gelcaps). 



Taking 2 of these pills produces seems to have the same anti-anxiety and sedative properties as 1mg Ativan or 10mg Valium. I would highly recommend it as a replacement for these habit-forming prescription drugs.



Thinking that MJ might open gates when used in combination with Valerian Root, I decided to try smoking a bowl (or even just a few hits) of MJ and then take 2 caps Valerian Root for meditiation.



Once the valerian kicks in, there are very diffrent psychotropic effects from just weed. It is very easy to enter a waking dream-like state; that is, it is much easier to visualize during meditation with this combination than with either drug alone. CEVs take on a new, distinct character: they are more colorful, more intense, more geometric. Valerian Root and Marijuana allow me to enter a visual dream-state very similar to what I have encountered on a low 2nd plateau DXM trip or with a rag of ether. These characterizations are very imprecise; Valerian Root is not something that will throw me into a different conscious state, it just allows those gates to be broken down a bit easier.



I enjoy the MJ/Valerian Root combination. I enter a controlled dream state, a relaxed and introspective state, and then I fall asleep to vivid dreams. Not a miracle by any means, but decent for someone looking to stay away from `hard' psychedelics but still looking for a nice, clean, relaxing, pre-sleep meditation.



Very useful for coming down from speed/coke. With everyday use the drug seems to be much less psychologically active, but still sedating.



-G. Valerius
