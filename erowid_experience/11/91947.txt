I have previously smoked quite a lot of marijuana and have battled a zolpidem addiction. I know what real effects are like vs. placebo effects.



My sister one day bought home a lemon balm plant, I had heard of it's calming effects and wanted to try it.



I first made a tea with about 5 grams of leaves: to my own disappointment it had no effects at all. Because I liked the tea, I continued drinking a cup every now and again.



One day after drinking about 5 or 6 cups I suddenly felt an extreme relaxation, even better than Xanax or Valium, because I could function 100\% normal while feeling amazing. This never happened again, but that one time was enough to get me interested. 



I ordered a bag of 60grams at a local health food store and started making tea. I drank cups of the stuff, but felt nothing, until one day when I decided to snort a line of finely crushed lemon balm. WOW!!! it was like the first time all over again.



For weeks I wanted to feel it again, trying snorting line after line to no avail. But then one day it struck me again! I couldn't believe this!



Why doesn't anyone know about this, and why doesn't it work every time?? Believe me this is no placebo, it is the best feeling on earth!



I truly love lemon balm!
