My first experience was by myself in my house.  A friend gave me a pill to try out so on a Saturday I took it.



2pm-popped 1 ephedrine capsule with 25mg dose.



about 2:40pm I started to notice an elevated heart rate and a great sense of energy.  Mouth is extremely dry and water doesn't last very long. My mind feels a bit cloudy.



3:00pm-I have a tremendous amount of productive energy.  I have so much energy that I do all my chores and clean the entire house for no reason.  My heart rate is much higher and I am sweating while sitting.  When I close my eyes, I feel like I am floating.  I feel so much stronger and capable of anything.  I have little sense of pain and minor annoyances don't bug me.  There is no way I would be able to read a book now.



6:00pm-Time passed quickly and it felt like only 15 minutes went by.  My feet hurt for some reason.  My energy level is down as well.



7:30pm-Extra boost is completely gone.  I still have energy but nothing significant.  I am going to sleep well tonight.



My conclusion about ephedra- A little bit of ephedra goes along way and makes me feel much better than being drunk.
