It all happened like this. Long ago, before the internet, (1990). A friend of mind ordered some woodrose seeds out of a magazine. She then sold me a dozen or so seeds. Then myself and another girlfriend (actually a friend=girl) were to spend an evening tripping at my place. I have never tripped, she was a BIG acid head.



So we each took 3 or 4 seeds. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. After about 2 hours, she took 4 more, but I declined. We sat around for another hour or so and she finally had had enough. With a quick gesture she was up and out of there. I was now alone. It was about 7 pm.



So I decided to watch some t.v. Back then, we only had about 4 network channels (unless you were rich and had cable or satellite). I was watching NBC. As I watched, I played with a pen in may hand. And played. And played. After about 20 minutes of this, I noticed\ldots .I'm starting to trip! It had been about three hours since swallowing the seeds. So then `Dear John' (t.v. sitcom) came on. And I laughed like I have never laughed before. I mean, it was side splitting hysterical, but also controlled laughter at the truly funny parts. I really `got into' the comedy.



Then the phone rang. When I went to get to the phone (across the room on the floor) I found myself crawling, not walking to it. It seemed far more `natural' to crawl. I think I took too long though because it was dead when I picked it up. So the night went on, and I just got more and more `stoned trippy'. Then a crime show came on about 10 pm. It was about organized crime and whatnot. And I was REALLY into it. Not scared or anything, just gripped by the intensity and drama. To me, it was like watching an Academy Award winning film like The Godfather, it was that intense. So then around 12am, I decided to go to bed. I was entering a strange phase of my trip, kind of dark with purple pyramid scapes and a mantra from that day (drug free America phrase) saying `Don't let drugs get in the way of YOUR dreams!'. Sleep then came down.



The next morning, I was REALLY groggy. Someone was knocking at my door, but I ignored it. Then that person crawled in through my window! Why? It was the girl from the night before. She thought I was DEAD so she broke in to see me. Why did she think I was dead you ask? Because she had a BAD trip the night before. Remember, she took 8 seeds. Then she left. Turns out she went out to dinner later with an uncle. By the time the breadbasket came to the table, she started to see the bread rolls dancing around. She went to the bathroom (to throw up perchance?) but nothing happened I'm sure. When she came back to the table, she just told her uncle outright `Dude, I'm tripping balls. Please take me home'. Luckily her uncle was a Head too, so he obliged.



Back at home, she spent all night in front of the toilet, throwing up, shaking, tripping and whatnot. A Marilyn Monroe poster on her wall kept trying to grab her. She kept thinking of calling 911, but she never did, thank God. She just tripped, and trembled and puked. What a way to go. By morning light she was okay enough to drive. She had worried all night that I had been the same way, but I was fine! She then went to my place to check on me. When I didn't answer my door, she freaked! So she broke in through the window. She described unto me a LIVING HELL and I am SOOOOOO glad that I had had a good trip instead. By the way, I have not done woodrose since!
