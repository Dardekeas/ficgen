I picked up two white ecstasy pills with a glock/pistol logo on them off my friend who tried them, and said they made her trip out sort of like 5-MeO-DiPT made her feel but stronger.  She said the person who gave them to her said they were laced with LSD. I find this very hard to believe.  



But being curious, and seeing as she did not like or want them, I purchased them from her for five bucks.  Online reports have reported some of these to contain piperazines (although never tested) and one report suspected it contained a 2C- base with low MDxx content.  Other reports said they were great.  All I have learned is, pills are different everywhere, and hopefully it isn't piperazine.  Nausea is no fun.



It's a Tuesday, I'm home alone until I'm guessing at least 6pm. I'm kind of nervous, but that's to be expected when you don't know exactly what you're taking.  



2:24pm -- Swallowed both with a cup of OJ



2:34 -- The usual butterflies in my stomach I get after taking pills is present



2:44 -- Mild nausea, feeling very slightly off baseline.  Going to go take a hit from the bong to help my tummy



2:54 -- Go to the bathroom to throw up.  Lasts about a minute.



2:58 -- Eyes feel sort of tight, if that makes sense.  Starting to notice very slight visual distortions.  Nausea is mostly gone.



3:04 -- feeling simultaneously hot and cold, mainly on my back.  Probably just sunburnt.  No change in visuals



3:25 -- Nausea stays at about a 3.5 (of 10), occasionally moving up to a 6.5, but I haven't thrown up again.  The visuals stay at the point where it feels like you're about to start a mushroom trip, but haven't quite begun.  Just minor blurring out of the corner of my sight and what not.  Head feels slightly foggy.



3:28 -- Just had one of those full body pulses that rises up to the eyes, that usual happens to me on mushrooms or a fair amount of MDMA, although I feel almost no MDMA effects.  Maybe this is starting to pick up. 



*After this point, nothing new happened, just nausea and the occasional body pulse and slight visual distortions*



I felt fine the next day.  My official guess on what the substance is, is going to be 5-MeO-DiPT.  It made me feel just like it, and it tasted just as chemically and gross on purging it up.



I do not recommend taking a substance if you are not sure what is in it, a better idea would have been for me to buy a test kit, but I didn't have the time.
