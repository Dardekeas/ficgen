I was recently placed in the mental ward of my local hospital by my family for exhibiting `delusions.' The hospital deemed me to be potentially schizophrenic but decided they cannot know until I am older, due to me being 17. 



While in the hospital, I was given two Abilify each day; one before bed and one in the morning. I am unsure of the actual dosage.



The day after being released from the hospital I did some coke with some friends and took a few hits from a pipe going around. Within a few minutes I felt incredibly nauseated, but I reckoned the coke did it because I had not smoked very much pot at all. 



A few days later I smoked a joint with my friend's family and got the same sickness, only worse because I had smoked more, but I figured I was just car sick because we had been driving around all night.



Another few days later, I smoked a joint with some friends. To my dismay, this made me very sick once more. Being the sleuthful debunker of mysteries that I am, I have concluded that the marijuana did it.



However, I've always smoked pot. I've probably smoked my weight in pot over the last few years. Then I determined that I cross medicated myself with marijuana and Abilify because I was still getting mild side effects of Abilify (Blurred vision, for one).



Cocaine still works, though, but I can't smoke pot, for a good while, I imagine.
