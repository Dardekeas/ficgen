Well, this is my third time trying kratom. The first two were with Bali kratom, the regular and fairly shitty commercial stuff. I hardly felt anything, and I was losing hope in kratom. But then I ordered some Ultra Enhanced Indo from a different vendor, and got a 10g bag of Thai kratom as a free sample. I decided to try that first. 



The only mistake I made was trying to just mix the 10g with water and drink it. It didn't work, and it tasted awful. I was gagging to get it down and probably lost a gram or two in the process\ldots  and I felt a little sick to my stomach from all the water I drank. However, about 20 minutes later, the mellow relaxing effects set in, and I felt fine. 



The full effects of the kratom didn't kick in until about an hour later, when I noticed the regular mild euphoria and slight affects on vision. At about an hour and a half I hit the peak of the experience, feeling perfect bliss. I ate a bagel because I was hungry. That was a bad idea, I think, because now two hours later on the come-down I feel a bit nauseous. I also have a very slight headache, but the euphoria still lingers. 



Overall this was an extremely positive kratom experience. The high is great -- mellow enough to stay completely lucid, but sedating enough to feel amazing at the same time.
