 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 

I have worked in computer shops\ldots tech work..for quite a long time now..and it's a common thing to keep a case or 2 of this stuff on hand.  

When i first started using it, I would get a somewhat nitrous-like experience\ldots distorted sounds, little visuals (i'll let it be known i've not done much nitrous, just a few balloons at concerts etc., so I may not be relating this very well).

OOOH BOY did things start to change.  I mean, I've done shrooms, lsd, all that, but OOOOH BOY

The first sign was a tightening around the temples..and my eyeglasses would seem to move further from my point of view. Things would start to look familiar, but VERY different.

Soon I met ZEB..a quick little 4' mischevious dude, always just running around a corner, and with a devilish laugh that i can still hear.  How did i know his name?  These creatures, they tend to repeat words or phrases in an echoey sort of manner.  Zebzebzebzebzeb..etc.  I remember chasing him around the small office several laps (thank god nobody was there), before saying to myself..ITS NOT REAL.  is it?

He never meant harm, but I swear he wanted to drive me crazy.

Keep in mind, it wasn't during every session that i would trip this hard, but it came in spurts, usually while i was alone, with some sort of background sounds, tv, radio, other voices.

There were others:

Blah : somewhat of an ogre, dimwitted but scary, liked to sing along with van halen

Little green fairies:  when they spoke i was overcome with a sense of joy, peace.  very sentimental to me.  they lived among the empty cans.

The little old lady:  wanted a beer, so did i, but it was working time ;(

The seductress:  always came up behind me..humming softly, soothingly, while I sat or stood facing a wall.  When her mouth came close to my ear and her arms encircled me was the best, and as the buzz wore off she would slip away.  Never got a good look, but long hair, very slight, loving.

I could go on forever here

The sunbeam forcefield, shocked me when i tried to cross it.

Occasional fear of just having swallowed metal shavings

Time frame of buzz : not long, 30sec to maybe 2.5 min..but intense(duh)

I would really love to hear from anyone with a similar experience, I don't do this any longer for fear of damage, but it is really a fond memory..I do not regret it in any way.

This was true hallucination to me, not distortion of reality, but the real thing.  

Had a major trip listening to `my woman from tokyo' during the funky solo part..tick tock tick tock, everything started moving like a pendulum, too sweet.
