Administration: fingertip to tongue and a few sips of water.

me: male, 200\#, almost 6 feet, `late 20s, early 30s'



12:00 noon burger, fries, \& drink



2:30p	3 to 4 mg dose



2:45	+1 in effect. Something's happening!  Primarily, feel a little numb in mind. Feels like a light alcohol buzz, but with better clarity. Secondarily, have a little sweaty/clammy feeling on face.





3:00	slightly, but noticeably imbalanced. (harder to type, a little extra thought required when walking up or down stairs). Feels a little heavier, mentally. A deeper breath every once in a while. very mild [tactile] sensory enhancement. haven't had music or tv yet. going to lie down.





3:10	the weight of this makes me consider whether or not I'm approaching a +2. 



3:15	needed a blanket, hard to decide if I'm hot or cold. still, craving a hot shower. I just might take one.



3:20	muscles a bit sore. jaw and arm. shower is calling. turned off AC for fear of cold-shock on way back. Wow,   the lack of noise from that thing is nice! motor skills noticeably impaired now. like drinking 2 or 3 alcohol drinks.  pupils are responsive. dilation minimal. 



3:35	+3 I'd be a fool to try and ignore this! The shower was REALLY GREAT for first 10 mins. Then, it tapers off a little. I must do this with a girl next time. -lots of soapy water and lots of touching all over! Feels divine! got a little teeth-grind at this stage, too. -I can wish it away.



3:40 	I can't take it anymore! porn city.



3:50	an unbelievable experience. a little thirsty now.



3:55	feels like a plateau. going to ride it through with a small burger and a cig. pupils responsive and dilation is minimal. I'm definitely buzzing, but I can type and put stuff in the microwave and eat with no problems.





4:15	quite coherent. feels clean. clean means if I wanted to just try and `sleep it off', I could do so without laying there in misery. -been there before with bad `e', that's how I know.





4:16	took 3 mg more. attempting cannabis soon. now I understand what `tryptamine feel' means. cannabis complements this kind of PLATEAU. I must've consumed cousins of this drug before. There's no point in peaking on both at the same time unless utter incoherence is your wish. 



4:20	After-thoughts, referencing earlier.

* the soreness lasted only 10 mins or so and vanished without notice.

* not once did I feel nausea or actually vomit. if it weren't for my mind trying to conceive every possible thing to write down, I'd never have thought to mention it!

* had 16 oz. [or little less] of fluid plus that burger since we started.



4:25	first hints of being jittery. -only a tiny hint, like coffee. it's ten mins since last dose. maybe that's why. given the nature of this drug so far, I don't expect it to last.



4:30 I licked the knife to get an extra mg or two.



4:35	noticing teeth \& jaw muscles again. no problem, though. getting curious about that smoke.



4:39	ok, getting it now.



4:45 lighting up now..



515 2 unforgettable spanks and wowwww.. time for WinAmp visualizations.



6:11 orgasms aside, let's just say I've been to the top a number of times. nite nite.



635 darvocet

640 must've taken too much moxy. on the verge of freakout at times. 



645 topographical slides are my hallucinations



650 just realized that this drug is like a blade. if I lean on it too hard, I bleed. I'm bleeding pretty bad.



653 feel a little better, strangely. 



657 bearable now

658 I take that back. almost cried like a little girl a minute ago

659 wishing this would end.

700 in an attempt to preserve sanity, will put head to bed in silence.



709 bed doesnt work. morphine now. I have a drug problem.

pain, guilt tears coming. I can see. thank god nobody knows.

for this, I honestly believe that I deserve to die.



714 trying bed again

727 hurting badly. cig now

733 going for a walk. activity is soothing. rest turns into disrest. I am not at liberty to describe the deeply personal and religious thoughts I've had. They're pretty bad.



806 more morph, feeling better. walking helps. 



851 back from walking. still really fucked. thoughts that would shame my mother while walking. half a xanax now.



909 I feel *noticeably* better. taking the other half of xanax now. (.5mg tabs)

will lay in bed for a while. no music.



919 I would rather die a physically horrible death than go through this again.



933 I just realized that my name was Dan. now, it's Danny.



939 yes, I never thought this would happen to me. 



948 as far as I'm concerned, you all can pot-smoke, coke-sniff, and extacy pill your brains out. DON'T EVER TAKE THIS SHIT



957 finally feel sane. yeah, more morphine now. btw, I've been avoiding alcohol.

yes, there is a religious thing `going on' with using booze to heal pain. as a morphine addict (oral only, never IV) alcohol is [usually] essential for my stimulus. I think I may give-in soon. before, (when bleeding mentally) I was afraid of what it might do to me. now, I think it would just be like normal. -make me tired and numb.



10:13 god damn this shit is sad. I've read through it a few times and believe me, you missed the part where every line in between read `Jesus Christ is this hell'



10:15 I actually feel well enough to go for *another* walk outside. This time, it will be with vodka \& sprite or coke -whatever's in the fridge to collect my thoughts about why the fuck [a million emotions surge] 1.) this happened 2.) it had to be so BAD. 3.) why nobody told me. 



I finally understand all those `parents' that cry and scream about taking this shit off the streets. I have no kids, but would let them do almost anything (weed, code \& e), as I have done before, except THIS. 



btw, the hallucinations stopped around the time of my 2nd half-tab of xanax.



going for a walk now. 10:25



10:38 got caught up with my roommate in some landlord politics. new fridge coming, apparently. I feel really good now. no booze yet, but going to sip it slowly in a min and see if I can bring a smile to today's -ahem. about the stuff before regarding misery, bleeding mentally and whatnot. it's all true. 



11:12 ok, 2nd slug of vodka is coming right up. considering what's in my system now, it's safe to assume that everything's gonna be ok. 



I think that tryptamines are the kind of drugs I wouldn't give to my worst enemy *or* my lover (the latter, I had been thinking the whole time). Extacy/MDMA, cocaine, and pot are childs-play, in my opinion, cause I've done them for years. Today, it was 5-MeO MIPT.
