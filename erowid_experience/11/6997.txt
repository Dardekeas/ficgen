[Erowid note: this person took 5,500mg (5 and a half grams) of acetaminophen (paracetamol) which can be dangerous to the liver if taken in very high doses; over 10 grams at a time can be fatal. See the Vermont Safety Information Resources, Inc. \href{http://hazard.com/msds/tox/f/q2/q730.html}{toxicity data page on acetaminophen} for more information. The maximum daily dosage (adult) is 4 grams (this estimate is from \href{http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic819.htm}{emedicine.com}, more on acetaminophen can be found through your favorite search engine). People with liver disease or who are regular users of alcohol are more at risk of liver failure from high doses of acetaminophen, even doses lower than 4 grams.]





By the way, this is my first time trying codeine. I stopped using illegal drugs and now use only pharmaceuticals when I can.





7:30


I just swallowed four pills containing codeine. They each contain 30mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol. This makes a total of 120mg of codeine. Lets wait and see..





7:45


I am taking 2mg of xanax for the combination. Just swallowed them\ldots going to lie down and listen to gatecrasher\ldots if the phone rings I will not answer\ldots 





8:00


Lying down and feeling EXTREMELY euphoric\ldots God Bless\ldots going to smoke a cigarette too, to make sure I don't fall asleep\ldots feeling really nice\ldots I wonder how long this is going to last. I am going to take another two tablets. Just swallowed them\ldots making a grand total of 180mg of codeine\ldots I am LOVING IT\ldots my back is feeling like I need to stretch it\ldots when I smoke the cigarette, I felt SOOOOO dizzy and bouncy that I  put it off\ldots 





Ok\ldots so I'm going to take another two pills, making a grand total of 240mg of codeine\ldots it's just TOO good and its only 9 o'clock. I wonder how I'm going to feel tomorrow morning? I just took another three pills cause the half life is very short and I want the high\ldots  Strange\ldots when I just got up to walk around, I felt some pain in my chest area (is that normal)\ldots 





WOWOWOWOWOWO!!!!!! I took 330mg of codeine on my first try\ldots  MY GOD!!! It was INCREDIBLE!! I just lay on the floor in pure euphoria for hour after hour after hour\ldots listening to albums in the dark\ldots every once in a while I would hear voices (hallucinate) and would be thinking of the ODDEST things on earth\ldots then I would impulsively say out words that came to my mind. I HAD to say them\ldots I felt like I was talking to someone who was listening to my every thought\ldots tomorrow again!!! And again\ldots and again\ldots this was GREAT!!!! (except for the pain in my chest that subsided after a few minutes\ldots I wonder what that was from). My mind set was strange. Sometimes I would find myself thinking of the weirdest things like I thought I was in a taxi one time and I started talking to the taxi driver to tell him where my house was\ldots another time I remember imagining I was somewhere else and my mind REALLY thought I was there and so I would say things accordingly\ldots I remember saying I love God very much for letting me feel this peace of mind.





I recommend doing codeine when the telephone is off, and you are NOT expecting anyone and have hours and hours and hours to kill\ldots and of course REALLY good music\ldots  this was an INCREDIBLE experience for me\ldots I'm off to bed now and the time in 2:00 AM\ldots 





Peace and Love to everyone in Erowid's vault
