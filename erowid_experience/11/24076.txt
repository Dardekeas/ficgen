It was a dark, rainy night.  A good friend of mine was throwing a party for his 21st birthday, and I was ready for it.  Another friend of mine had just bought a new bowl and was excited to break it in.  He packed one bowl of schwaggy weed after another, which definately had the schwaggy kind of high, but still very fun, especially seeing as how I hadn't smoked in a week or so.  After some insightful conversations and a lot of laughing and eating, my friend pulled out some salvia, of which I'd never done before.



The two guys who smoked it before me took two hits each, but I walked out of the room after my first hit and that ended up being my only one.  I came in and sat down a minute later, and one of them said that he was starting to feel kind of wierd.  After a few minutes of incoherent conversation and thourough confusion, we walked outside and the `trip' seemed to be over.  I am definately not giving up on salvia, seeing as how I had such a small amount, but I can't exactly say that it enhanced the evening at all\ldots but then it was time to tap the keg\ldots 



The beer was from a local brewery, 8.5\% alcohol, and tasting good.  The next few hours was a typical party:  every so often some kind soul would pass to me a bowl or joint, sipping at the beer, a little dancing here and there, a little talking here and there\ldots overall a very good time.  Then something amazing happened.



I am a very serious musician.  Thus, when the drum circles begin, I am all about joining in.  This time, however, I had brought a small wooden flute as a birthday gift for my friend.  When the drums began to beat, I picked up that little wooden flute and began to jam.  --(at this point I will say that as a child I took three years of private recorder lessons (yes, private recorder lessons) and know how to play quite well, even though this wasn't quite a recorder)--  I had smoked just enough pot and drank just enough beer for my self-consciousness (and other boundaries, for that matter) to melt away, and my spirit came soaring forth.  I danced with incredible intensity and played the flute like I've never played before.  I don't know how long it lasted, as time didn't really seem to exist during that period, but it was one of the most liberating experiences I have had in a long time.  After the music ended, I, tired from dancing, made a cup of tea for myself (yerba mate, namely).



At that point I got into a philosophical conversation with my birthday friend.  After a few minutes he said that he wanted to show me something in his room.  He closed the door behind us when we went in and suggested that we smoke some DMT.  I had been curious about the drug for a long time, so I immediately agreed.



The way we smoked it wasn't like I had heard it being smoked before.  The DMT was in the bottom of a glass vial.  He held the lighter underneath the vial and it began to mist up inside.  I sucked it out through a small pipe that I stuck into the vial, and couldn't really even see much of the smoke when I breathed out, although I could feel it in my lungs a little.



When he was taking his hit, I was staring at a lamp shade, and the colors on it and all the details became incredibly vivid.  I looked at him when he was done and said `wow, this is amazing already,' and, without much thought, lay down on my back.  At that point, staring at his ceiling, it was as if everything beautiful I had ever experienced surfaced to my present conscious level and culminated with a live performance of Bach's B Minor Mass that I had attended about a week before.  I could feel the tears coming and they began streaming down the sides of my face.



Of all the beautiful things I experience and enjoy, DMT seemed to really bring them to their fullest reality.  Sometimes looking at a great painting, or the sky, or listening to a great piece of music, those things seem so seperate.  But at that moment, even though I was experiencing none of those things, all of them that I have experienced and I still hold with me came out and touched me in a way that I'll never forget, reminding me of the fullness of life.



After an indefinate period of this, probably 2 or 3 minutes, I sat back up and gave my friend a big hug, which lasted for another 2 or 3 minutes.  At that point we both sat down and talked for a few minutes, most of which was me blabbering about what had just gone through my mind.  I don't think he heard much of it, but it didn't matter, it was a great moment.



The effects wore off and the rest of the night was a gradual decrescendo from there.  I don't know if I'll ever do DMT again, even if its offered to me (in other words, I probably will).  Even though I'm sure that it was a light trip as DMT trips go, I couldn't have asked for or wanted any more.  Drugs may be fun, but we all must be reminded that there is much more to explore in the uncharted depths of our minds than those experiences which drugs bring us, and to let them expand us rather than destroy us.  For those of you who have just finished reading this report, I advise you to log off your computer and go outside, or read a book, or listen to your favorite music.  Staring at the same source of light thats 2 feet in front of your face is incredibly unhealthy and minimizes cognitive activity!  But enough of this!  Thank you.
