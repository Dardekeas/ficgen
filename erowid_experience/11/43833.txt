SSRI's (Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, etc..) were a Big Thing in the mid-90's.  I was on Zoloft for 5 years, starting in 1996. They first gave me Zoloft when I was 12.



I was a quiet, sad and docile pre-teen, very shy, had been chronically suicidal since childhood.  A concerned teacher, who tired of my bursting into tears during class, reccomended I see a therapist.  The therapist reccomended I see a psychiatrist.  After a brief evaulation, the psychiatrist scratched his shiny, bald head and told me I had Depression.  He sent me home, that night with a paper bag full of light blue Zoloft pills.



After a week on Zoloft, it started to kick in.  And I had my first manic episode.  I ran around the block screaming, then came home talking happy gibberish with a dazed look on my face.  My poor mother was bewildered.  She called the psychiatrist and got his partner, instead.  His partner said, `If your daughter is reacting like that to Zoloft, she's probably bi-polar.'  My mom did not want me to endure the stigma of being bi-polar, so she didn't tell my real psychiatrist about the incident.



I continued to have manic phases while on Zoloft, throughout the years.  However, the Zoloft did give me a new kind of confidence I never had before.  I felt less depressed and a whole lot braver.  So brave, I picked fights all through high school and was an angry beast of a girl until I finally quit taking it, when I was 17.

Another thing:

NEVER SNORT ZOLOFT!  IT HURTS!



My freshman year of high school, I was trying to impress these boys, notorius druggies, so I offered them some of my Zoloft.  `Wow!  Pharmies!' they said and began to chop up my pills with their school IDs.  Soon, the Zoloft was crushed to a powder and sorted into lines.  We stuck straws up our noses and snorted it.  Then all, simultaneously began to howl.



Now, I've felt a lot of pain in my time.  And not much has hurted worse than Zoloft eating away at my nostrils.  It was like a thousand wasps, covered in acid, stinging the insides of my nose.  As it dripped down my throat, I feared I was going to suffocate.  And the pain didn't stop for hours!



The next day was Thanksgiving.  I went to my family dinner and everyone wondered why I was blowing my nose every 5 seconds.  `Uhh.. just a cold.'  I told them, when in reality, my nose was still tight and achey, my throat still raw from snorting the dreaded Zoloft.
