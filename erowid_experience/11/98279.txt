In the pub one evening with a few friends, I disappeared to the toilets with an associate to try this `MXE' drug that everybody had been banging on about. It was in powder form and I racked up a decent sized line (at least 0.6g) as I had been informed that the effects were similar to that of Ketamine, a drug which I have used heavily.

After about five minutes I started to feel heavy and quickly escaped into the pub garden for some fresh air\ldots 



10.00am the next morning I wake up on my sofa wearing a pair of men's boxers and none of the clothes I had been wearing the night before, obviously wondering what the fuck had happened as I couldn't remember anything past sitting in that pub garden. I felt absolutely horrific, blurred vision, dehydrated, incredibly weak stomach, heavy legs, absolutely confused and tripping balls, the sort of balls that you get when verging on a K-hole. There was a distinctive pain in my face, so I decided to check myself out in the mirror and was shocked to discover I had a massive black eye and had split my eyebrow open, all encrusted with blood alongside a bent, puffy and obviously broken nose.



I rang one of the friends that were at the pub with me to ask for an explanation and this is what they told me:



After I had disappeared I was found outside sitting on a bench staring straight into space with my mouth open, a cigarette rapidly burning down and spilling ash all over my hand. They had tried to get my attention by shouting me, shaking me, waving in front of my face, screaming in my ear and even slapping me, but it didn't work. The lights were on but I definitely wasn't home.



They then made a fast decision to carry me out of the pub, but I was completely rigid and a dead weight, making it difficult for them to try and bend my arms and legs into the back of a taxi. They could not get a peep out of me for the next 10 hours (despite the fact my eyes were open and blinking) panicking as they were not aware of the fact I had even taken this drug. I had ended up vomiting and pissing myself all over my couch (and my friends which were sitting on it), completely oblivious. My heartbeat (which they had been keeping an eye on) was ridiculously irregular, beating hard and fast one minute, then hardly beating at all a moment later.



A few hours into this, they had tried standing me up to see if they could get me to walk, but as I had no sense of balance, I just fell straight forward, smashing my face off the wooden floor, therefore resulting in the cut up face I was explaining earlier.

Eventually I started to come to life, my arms and legs twitching as I began to regain the use of them. 



Overall, my experience of MXE was one I would not recommend, where is the fun in disappearing from inside your mind for 12 hours? Pointless. However I have since tried significantly smaller doses of this drug, which have in turn had reasonably similar effects to Ketamine, only lasting a hell of a lot longer and leading to you just wishing it would end. All in all, I would not recommend.
