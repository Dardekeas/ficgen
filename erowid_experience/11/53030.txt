Prior to this, my experiences with trees were pretty humdrum. I hardly ever felt anything, even after smoking 4 Ls. I always hoped that maybe one day I would experience the sensations that are supposed to come with weed. However, I got more than I asked for. 



I was in my friend's car around 9 at night, parked on an empty street. He was packing his bowl, then lit up, and passed it to me. I inhaled the smoke like nothing, as I've done this plenty of times before. I took 6 strong hits, allowing the smoke to fill my lungs as much as it could. My friend's phone rang and he talked to them for about 10 seconds when I began to feel somewhat odd. My legs were becoming a little bit numb but I just sat back, excited, because I thought I was finally getting a high. 



Suddenly, I felt as if my body was being thrust forward, as if I was on a roller coaster. I looked up to the sky and felt as if I was flying. I screamed for my friend and asked him if this was how I was supposed to feel. He laughed and said no, which made me freak out a great deal. I began shaking uncontrollably and screamed at my friend to drive. He seemed so confused, as he was stoned out of his mind. I was crying histerically and screamed `DRIVE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND!! WHY AREN'T YOU DRIVING?' I hardly knew what I was saying and why. But at that point, I was so terrified that I didn't care. I felt like my head was disconnected from my body. He parked his car in front of the place that everybody in their teens hang around at night. I opened my door because I felt incredibly clausterphobic and I felt like I was losing my mind. My friend came up to me and began examining me and asking me if I was on any other drugs. I told him `no' and kept sobbing histerically and holding on to the seat.



I kept talking to myself, and telling myself to calm down but I couldn't. I've always said that if I was in a situation like this, I'd be able to control what I was saying/doing/etc. But I was wrong. Every emotion/word/cry that came out of my body seemed to flow without any inducement. I thought about things that depressed the shit out of me. I called my friends and cried. I couldn't talk and they weren't understanding so I felt like they didn't care. So I cried even more, feeling closer to death. There were bizarre times that would follow my depressive state of mind, and I would start laughing randomly at absolutely nothing. I knew exactly what was going on, but I could not control it. I kept telling myself to stop shaking, but I could not. My heart was beating so rapidly and I began talking to God. Talk about a spiritual epiphany.



My friend told me to talk to his friend on the phone who has apparently had many experiences like mine with other drugs. She told me `Weed is just a plant. Everything you are feeling right now is real and it will wear off in about 30 minutes.' She made me feel so much better but all I could do was cry out a thank you to her on the phone. I still felt like I was flying. But the scariest thought was that this would never end. My friend took me to my other friend's house where I cried//laughed// and said a lot of random bull. 



Thankfully, I was able to sleep this trip off, and awaken the next day with a somewhat opaque visual in my mind of what happened the night before. I still felt somewhat disconnected from my body and very depressed as well. I didn't smoke for a while after that. And needless to say, I felt like shit for a while after. I understood that I was going through withdrawal so I made the best of it. But I could sure have used some anti-depressants within that time.



Unfortunately, I find it that my curiosity gets the best of me all to often. So I smoked 3 Ls again that night with my friends. I felt like I was flying again a little and everything seemed a bit funnier but other than that, it wasn't bad. Now, I have realized that I must move on and leave my drug experiences in the past. I regret a lot of things I said and did that night. Also, I found that smoking marijuana, over time, made me incredibly lazy and I tend to space out a lot more than I used to. I also stopped doing work at school and my grades have dropped significantly. It's not going to be easy to get back up to where I was, and I am a person with not very much will power, but doing my best.
