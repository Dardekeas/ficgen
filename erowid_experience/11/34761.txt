I started taking 100 mg of Tramadol, 2 pills of 50 mg each at 23:30 (11:30). 



I was sitting in my room in front of my computer and nothing happened for about half an hour (00:00). I took 2 more pills, that makes the total dosage to 200 mg. I started to sweat, but that passed a few minutes later. All over I felt calm and my pulse/breathing was very slow. I felt nothing other for about an hour when suddenly att 01:00 it started to itch all over my body, that went on about ten minutes. 



Around 02:00 some pain started to come back, I felt pain in my shoulders from sitting down to long so I moved around a bit. The clock went on to 03:20 when I started feeling nausea so I laid down on my bed. That's when things started to happen. I got some weird sound hallucinations, it could have been sleep oriented but I felt awake and warm. 



The nausea passed after 10-15 minutes so I got up and felt disoriented, kinda, what's the word, `new awake'(?). I turned on the tv and watched some cartoons and later decided to masturbate to test aphrodisiac effects. I had a hard time there, I couldn't get an orgasm for a long time, and I'm not one of those guys that can work all night if you know what I mean. So my guess is that some functions got sedated, perhaps it could work as a sex prolonger. 



I did 2 hours before, 21:00-21:30, drink 1/4 gallon of beer (1 liter) and ate some candy. So I got a lot of carbohydrates in my stomach, but no real food.



Over all it was a nice experience, not so intense that I hoped for, perhaps 100 mg more would have done the trick.
