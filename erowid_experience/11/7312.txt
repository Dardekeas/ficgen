I had found a very large bottle of Hydrocodone/APAP (Acetaminophen) pills in my parents' medicine cabinet and decided to grab a few to see what they did.  Before I tried them, I gave 3 to my friend who took them and told me that it had been a very enjoyable experience that was almost like an LSD trip.  So today I decided to try them, taking 3 as well.  

	

I took them at about 11:45 and started feeling the effects 20 or so minutes later.  It felt just like a codeine high at that point but I knew it would get quite a bit more intense.  At that point me and 2 friends, J and L, decided to leave campus and walk to a nearby park (we were in school).  On the way there about 10 minutes later, the effects were still coming up, and becoming more surreal.  We were walking up a hill and I had the feeling that we were climbing a very steep mountain and that we would never get to the top. My legs got tired and I had to rest once (even though it was quite a gentle slope), and when we got to the park at about 12:35 the effects had gotten pretty intense.  

	

The three of us smoked one bowl of some fairly strong weed, then hung out in the park with 2 other friends we had found there.  At that point it was definitely more than a normal codeine high.  I kept claiming I was different animals and kept mistaking normal objects for other things (for example I thought this tree was a `cow with a big horn that starts out small then gets all big' etc).  I had a nice body feel, but my skin was all cold and clammy, and my arms were pretty numb.  

	

We walked back to school and by the time we got there, both the weed and the hydrocodone had reached thier plateaus, and it was a fairly heavy trip.  On the way back, we were of course walking downhill, but I was convinced that we were still walking uphill which was very confusing because we walked uphill to get there.  

	

When we got back was when the most interesting part of the experience happened.  I started just rattling off poetry, it just kept flowing from me for about half an hour.  A couple of the friends I was with are very good poets, and they said that the stuff I was saying was some of the best poetry they had ever heard (even though I have always sucked at writing poetry).  I wish someone had been able to write what I was saying down, but no one had a pencil and paper.  I just kept talking in poetry for quite a while, and after a while I realized that I wasnt even able to talk in anything but rhymes and poetry, it was quite wierd.  Everything I was talking about was very surreal too, I wish I could remember some.  

	

The effects lasted until about 5:00.  Overall it was a very very enjoyable trip, something I would definitely want to do again, but this time have a taperecorder with me.  Someone told me my voice was very different, calmer, smoother and mellower.  The one bad part of it was that at one point about halfway through, I suddenly totally flipped out on someone for like nothing at all, I was yelling and kicking over trash cans and stuff.  After I calmed down, for about 10 minutes, I had this horrible wave of depression and sadness and I almost cried for no reason at all but after that I was fine.
