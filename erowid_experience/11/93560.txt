This was my first experience with ethylone. I have not used any other MDxx drugs before.



I was visiting my friend, T, for a night of smoking weed and watching football with a few other friends. Shortly before midnight, T suggested that we do some ethylone, also known as bk-MDEA. T has done ethylone before and enjoyed it. He told me that he was going to do 150mg. After doing some research on the internet, I decided that 100mg would be a good dose for me. If we had dosed earlier, I would have done more, but I wanted to get some decent sleep. We had not smoked in a few hours so T and I decided that we would hit the bong during our experience.



-T+0:00-



T weighed out 100mg of powder on a scale. I dissolved the powder in a cup of water and drank it. The water had a bitter medicine-like taste, but it wasn't too bad. I have had medicine that tasted much worse. The time of the dose was 12:15 am. I was in a great mood and my surroundings were comfortable and calm. I was eager to start feeling the effects.



-T+0:10-



A few minutes after the dose, I smoked a little bit of weed from the bong that my other friend, D, had loaded. 



-T+0:45-



At 1:00 am, T and I started smoking some very nice bud from the bong. After a few minutes, we realized that we were talking fast. Our conversation went back and forth rather rapidly. T suspected that the ethylone high would involve more of this attentive, fast paced talking. I agreed. We were talking in depth about the chemistry and effects of this drug. Normally it would still be an interesting topic, but on this, it's fascinating! Marijuana often puts me in an intellectually stimulated mindset. The ethylone seemed to have enhanced this effect as I found myself thinking very clearly and thouroughly articulating the points of our conversation, despite having smoked enough to get me pretty high.



-T+1:30-



It about 1:45 am, I loaded a bowl in the bong with some super resiny weed from an unfinished joint and shared it with D. T then proceeded to load two more bowls. 

Given the potency of the weed and the strong effects that it had on me earlier in the night, I should have been extremely high, but I was not. At this point, I felt very calm and relaxed, almost stoned. The effects differed from the those of the weed in that they were more uplifting and stimulating. The ethylone countered most of the effects of the weed. I felt absolutely no cognitive impairment despite the marijuana. I am unsure if I actually was unimpaired, or if I had an unrealistic confidence in my mental functioning. I continued to be intellectually intrigued and was highly

interested in two psychedelics T had that I was not familiar with. I would double task between reading online and rambling on to T about whatever I was reading, regardless of if he particularly cared.



-T+2:00-



We had been exchanging descriptions of our recent drug experiences for a while. I noticed the empathogenic effects of the ethylone. It felt easier to express my feelings about our conversation and tell stories involving other people that I may not have brought up otherwise. What I perceive to be the social part of my mind was very hyperactive at this point. I still felt very intellectually active.



-T+2:24-



Cool moment. We noticed that the clock on T's tv box wasn't right. The clock read 1:39am, which was earlier. We then realized that the time had changed for the DST change. Excited that we get an extra hour, we celebrate by hitting the bong. :)



-T+3:00-



I started to come down after about three hours. I wasn't so perky anymore. I finally started to feel like I had actually been smoking. My mind started to get cloudy. I was laughing a lot.  This state was relaxing.



-T+3:30-



Everything is not so good from this point on. I felt really stoned and drained. I developed a headache, my body felt stiff and somewhat unstable when I walked outside.



-T+4:15-



The headache got worse. I began to get tired but at the same time, I knew that I could not calm down my mind enough to sleep. The stiffness I felt earlier began to manifest itself as soreness in my joints, starting with my knees and slowly progressing out on my limbs. I started to feel like crap.



-T+5:00-



I tried to sleep but didn't have much luck. I couldn't find a comfortable position without being sore within a minute of two. The headache didn't help either.



-T+12:00-



The next day I was rather groggy. I got maybe four hours of sleep and the sleep I got wasn't that great. The headache was gone but I still felt a little off. The next night I slept like a baby!



-Summary-



Overall, I was a bit disappointed with ethylone. Even though my dose wasn't particularly high, the comedown and hangover was pretty bad.  The high was pretty nice. It was definitely an interesting feeling. I didn't feel any euphoria, but I just felt generally content and interested. I had a sense of being very comfortable in my body. However, the way that this drug interacted with the weed was an additional downside. The ethylone numbed my body buzz and overpowered my head high. The full effects of both at the same time surely would have been great. 



I suspect the negative effects were do to a crash in my serotonin levels. The crash was surprising considering that I only used 100mg. My friend reported a much more positive experience. He felt euphoric but did not experience any crash symptoms. For me, the crash and the suppression of the weed made the high not worth it. As this drug becomes more well known, maybe I will understand why it affected me and my friend in such different ways.
