I am submitting this simply because I don't someone to make the same mistakes I did. I read up on Kava, thought I had a good grasp of how to prepare the drug, and how to prepare myself for it. I bought two 1/4 ounce bags of Kava root pieces at a local [Alternative] Bookstore. I took them home, chewed on two pieces of root and felt a numbing sensation in my mouth.



I dumped both bags into a cuisinart and unsuccessfully tried to make Kava powder. When this didn't work, I poured in 1 cup of 2\% milk and tried again. Kava root is hard to grind up!



Frustrated, I poured the milky substance into a larger bowl, added 2 cups of milk, 2 teaspoons of nutmeg grounds and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I'm not entirely sure why, it just seemed like a good idea at the time. I let this mixture set for about 30 minutes, stirred it up, strained out the bits of Kava root, and drank the resulting 3 cups of fluid. It didn't taste all that bad really. My mouth went numb almost immediately, but that was it. The only thing I noticed was at my band's practice two hours later, I found myself easily frustrated by my drummer's incompetence.



I'm not sure what I did wrong, but possibly it had something to do with the fact that the Kava wasn't ground up.  Oh well, learn from my mistakes, whatever they were!
