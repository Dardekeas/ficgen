Recently, a bunch of my friends went to local doctors where they were prescribed 8mg Suboxone sublingual tablets for their so called `addiction'. They really were in no condition to need these pills, but pushed for them anyway, until eventually getting their way. After trying them, they gave a few of the tabs to me to try. Mind you, I have a high opiate tolerance, and have been abusing OCs, Percocets, and Hydrocodones for quite some time now. 



To begin with, not knowing the absolute strength of the drug, I let one tab dissolve under my tongue. It tasted like oranges, with a little bit of medicine mixed in. A nice little buzz was felt approx. 45 minutes after first taking it, and I had high hopes. I waited about another 45 minutes to no avail, and without doing any research, dissolved the second tab.



In know way shape or form should I have ever take down 16 mg of Suboxone on my first dose without knowing the full effects. Apparently, this is a 24 hour drug and I was nowhere near reaching a peak before downing the second dose. Well, as soon as I dissolved that second tab, the first one started kicking in hard, and I knew I was gonna be comatose before long. I popped in a movie, layed in my bed, and let the drug take its course.



Wow, this stuff is really strong. For a while, I was dozing in and out, not really paying attention to the movie, loving life, and loving the feeling in my body. I've never done heroin in its pure form, so I don't know where it is on the chain, but Suboxone is very comparable to a strong OC dosage.



Anyways, The next day I was still high, and my addiction did not ask for anymore the whole day. All in all, it was a fun time, and is a drug I may or may not use in the future.
