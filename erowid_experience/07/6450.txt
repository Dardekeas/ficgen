The Great Red Rock Debate sure did get my interest.  I had never before even seen opium, when someone I knew just happened to have some.  It did not resemble the bright red, ruby-like appearance of the Dragon's Blood incense, but was rather more reddish brown in color.  I smoked some on top of a bowl, and by the time I went home I felt stoned, with an added dimesion of pure calm.  Needless to say, I wanted to buy some for myself.  So I bought 1/4 oz. of the infamous substance still not absolutely knowing whether or not it was a hoax.  I set out for my own answer, so here I sit smoking my second bowl of straight red rock, no cannabis to get in the way and screw up my perception of the experience.  It does have an effect.  It is not like that of marijuana, where to me the effects come on very pronounced after the first few inhalations.  It is a very slow process of reaching a comfortable level\ldots too little won't do it, so smoking one bowl and calling it quits does not work.  I just think it depends on what you get.  Some smart S.O.B. figured he could sell incense for red rock, and so he succeeded as I read many of these reports claiming different things.  It just depends on what you get.
