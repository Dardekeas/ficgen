I have been snorting Heroin everyday for about the last 4 months and I got to the point to where I knew I was addicted and I couldn't take it anymore. At first it started out as occasional use as I would buy maybe 2 or 3 \$20 caps a week but soon within a month turned into a \$40-\$60 a day habit. If I went a day without it my nose would start running, my eyes would start watering and the 2nd day without it I would get severe diahrea, be extremely depressed and anxious, and would have extremely intense cravings for more Heroin.



About 4 weeks ago I was at the beginning stages of withdrawal when my friend gave me 2 50mg Tramadol pills. Within about 1 1/2 hours a sense of well being came over me I didn't really feel high but I felt content, my runny nose dried up and I really didn't crave Heroin much at all. After trying the tramadol I ordered 150 50mg pills off the internet for \$75. When I got the pills delivered 3 days later I was a wreck, I was going almost 3 days without Heroin. I took 2 pills and within 2 hours it felt like the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders. The first couple of weeks I took 2 50mg pills of Tramadol 3 times a day and it kept my Heroin withdrawals at bay pretty well, it actually even improved my mood and gave me more energy then Heroin ever did. 



The last week I weened myself down to 2 50mg of Tramadol twice a day and when I had only 6 pills left I only I took 2 once a day for 3 days. It has been almost 4 days since I've had any Tramadol and nearly a month without any Heroin and I won't lie, I do think about Heroin, but I'm not suffering from the crushing depression, anxiety and cravings that I always got and that's what always made me get more Heroin. I only used about 4 months and I only snorted it.
