I found this plant for sale on the website of my usual herbal reseller. They were very little explanations. I searched the internet and found many photographs and botanical descriptions, but very little mention of the alleged medicinal virtues of the plant. 



settings:

I'm not very happy these days. I feel a bit lonely, not very involved in my activities. I feel sometimes depressed, but not all day long. I had 3 cups of China black tea in the morning (I'm a former strong coffee drinker, I quit 3 weeks ago for stomach problems - tea is less aggressive but doesnt give me my `morning boost', it just helps to avoid withdrawal) and started the day with a marijuana cigarette containing a pinch of kanna (Sceletium tortuosum). I'm not taking otc or prescription pharms. I'm smoking pot daily. I'm using kratom and blue lotus once a week. I occasionally consume other `herbal highs'. I drink alcohol less than once a week, rarely more than 1or 2 glasses of wine or beer.



The plant material consists mostly of big hollow stems and of green hard fragments which could come off leaves or of not bloomed flowers. It smells `vegetal' in a way which reminds me of many plants - but I cannot say which.



T - 5 : 30 : I drink 3 cups of good quality black smoked tea (from China - my favorite one). I feel depressed of the (partial) lack of coffeine, and also for living in a place I hate.



T - 5 : I smoke a cigarette of marijuana with a little kanna in it. I get computer hardware problems. I solve them and feel rather happy at that.



T + 0 : I smoke a little amount (1 or 2 g ?) of the green material in a cigarette. The fragments are thick and hard. The little cigarette weights more than a twice bigger marijuana stick. The taste is light, not bad tasting. The smoke isnt harsh. I'm experienced in smoking herbs, so other people could find it bad tasting and harsh. The taste has something from wild dagga flowers and also from Salvia divinorum leaves, but very very light. 



10 minutes later, I feel a light relaxation. It's nice and makes me want to smoke some pot. 20 minutes later, the relaxed feeling vanishes. So i decide to boil a tea, just to see.



T + 0 :30 : I put 2 teaspoons of the green plant material plus a handful of stems in a pot of water. The whole weighs about 7 or 8grams. (the stems are very light, while the green material is heavy). I allow it to boil for 15 minutes. The tea becomes quickly yellow/light green. I let it cool down for ten minutes and then drink the 2 cups of liquid. The smell reminds me of the Salvia divinorum leaves, but the taste is much lighter than I expected. It's rather nice to drink, even if I guess that many people wouldn't like it. It is not bitter and i drink it without adding sugar. The effects progressively come in 20 minutes later. 



T + 1 :30 The effects are growing stronger. I feel a bit excited, in a way which reminds me of catuaba but with some sedation which is more like Lagochilus inebrians. I'm feeling slightly confused, but my mind works normally.  I'm a little irritable, but patient at the same time. It is weird. I don't feel euphoric nor happy. I feel like having taken a stimulant for a long lasting physical outdoor work, although the stimulation is not really strong. 



Being physically active while mentally relaxed could sound a bit like low-dosed Ephedra, but it has not much in common. I feel a bit cloudy minded and I'm making mistakes while typing. I'm feeling a little inebriated. My body is itching just like in an opiate come down. 



T + 2:30 :  The effects seem to very slowly fade away. 



This plant has some effects of its own but doesn't bring something really new. It certainly has a medicinal potential, but (at the dose I used) has nothing interesting as a fun or enlightening drug. Maybe there is a special way to use it. I didn't find any info about the dosage and preparation methods\ldots
