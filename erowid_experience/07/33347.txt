I must declare, anyone involved in using any sort of opiate for a long time, certainly can deem themselves as a fiend; no, just joking, in actuality, my flower-tea has been very very good to me.



I have been involved in two accidents, both times I was rearended; I have had a VERY hectic life, been involved in a breakdown of a engagement (:() and deaths in the family. I've quit school for now and have been busting my ass day in and day out with a very physical job.



Poppy tea keeps me going.



All I can say is when I go ahead and drink some of my brew (prepared by cutting the pods in half, removing the seeds, using a coffee grinder (thanks mr. coffee!) to grind them into dust and then boiling water.. taking the water off the stove when it has boiled, then mixing in the dust.. finally waiting a few mins, then running it through the coffee filter and drinking it -- goddamn run on sentence) I feel like a million bucks -- I'd relate it to `liquid heroin'.. there is a rush, if you do enough and everything seems crystal clear and perfect.



I get probably 50\% more work done at work (construction laborer) than I would if I was just dragging ass all day.



Short of time for now, but I'll add a few more experiments and items later on this week.  For now, just know that poppy tea, and arranging those flowers in a liquid way.. is quite good and I suggest anyone looking for a relaxing, slow and pure day, to try it.
