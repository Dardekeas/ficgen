Although snorting clon.  Is to me naughty, I could not resist doing it\ldots  It is a fine sat.  night and I took the insufflated clon. , about 5 mins ago.  Naughty. I just had to know. 



To be utterly fair clonazepam is a very helpful drug and has helped me significantly with panic disorder/anxiety. I personally think also that pregabalin (lyrica) could well be a useful aid in the fight to recover from substance dependency. Its also helped my meralgia p.  For which it was prescribed. It (pregabalin) with occasional usage of clonazepam as required has changed my life positively and the potent mood stabilisation of pregabalin is a real life saver. Its basically dumb of me to snort this amazing med, and I never will again, out of principal. It is the most effective benzo (and I've had em all) for real anxiety, long lasting, paralysing and nightmarish. 



Pregabalin+clonazepam cured my agoraphobia and I could for the first time ever face the flower man and buy my girlfreind some flowers. I have noticed a lot of positives about this combo. I am starting a full time sound engineerring exam\ldots  On the basis of the empathic way which I had-2mg clonazepam, 150 pregabalin. As I had done a mediocre test score it was up to me to keep on talking. I also used 20mg vinpocetine that time, for proper brain functioning. Although pregabalin takes up tp 2 weeks to kick in, its an amazingly efective painkiller/antidepressant. Anyways I got in to college, they liked me. Cool.  +ten mins\ldots  . Melting nicely\ldots  Typing difficult\ldots  Mmmmmm. I have a pile of it powdered up next to the computer. If only I could find that e.
