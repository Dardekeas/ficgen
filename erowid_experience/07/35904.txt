One afternoon at school, after showing them off to my friends, I took 4 milligrams of xanax.  It was lunch time at school and I took them on a full stomach.  



I went back to English class and everything was starting to get a little dizzy.



I went on to band class, in which we were doing nothing because the director was leaving us.  I only know this because I was told, I don't remember what happened in that class at all.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



After school I somehow managed to safely drive home.  It's beyond me how I didn't wreck or something.



I came home and soon crashed in the recliner.  I must have zonked completely out.  Later when my mom was home,  I staggered like a drunk man into our living room.  She asked what was wrong and I drunkenly replied `Nothin\ldots ' And went back to the recliner. 

I woke up later that evening and felt normal.  My mom didn't think too much about the episode that afternoon, though both my parents remarked that my speech sounded slurred.
