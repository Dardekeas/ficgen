Recently ive been experimenting with alot of different drugs and medications, then I found a bottle of effexor (Venlafaxine). I decided to pop 2 effexor pills (75mg each) and took some alcohol with it. Be warned that this is not a good idea to mix effexor with alcohol, but I considered the risk and took it anyway.



I downed the pills about about 6pm and sat back a drank a few beers. Around 30 min later I started to feel very dissy and began to get lightheaded. Shortly after that I felt very isolated, and felt very relaxed but strangely frightened at the same time. I also felt strong nausea.



At about 7:30 pm I became very drowsy, and my speach was extreamly slured, I tried to walk to my kitchen but found myself stumbling over myself. I convinced myself that it was just the alcohol so went back into my room and laid down to watch TV. As I tried to watch TV, I noticed movement in the corner of my eyes. I cant describe what I saw exactly but it was like a bunch of flies were flying all around.



Shortly after, at about 8 pm I get very sleepy and passed out.



I woke up the next morning feeling very strange, like I would the next day after smoking alot of marijuana, but it was more than that, I felt isolated from everything, I couldn't focus. This was a very weird experience, one that I will not try again because of the effects during and after taking the drug.
