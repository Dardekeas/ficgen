This happened a while ago now, so I'll try to remember the details best I can. I had read the one report about this plant's root claiming it to be more powerful then opium. Well, I figured if theres something out there better then opium and legal, I should get some.



I went to a local herb store and found it. The smallest amount one could get was 1 ounce and around \$12.00. Relative to the other herbs, it was expensive, but if it was anything like opium I figured it would be worth it. They sold it powdered or as the root cut, and I went with cut. I didn't want to deal with the mess and straining of powders.



So I go home, boil some water and put about 2 grams in a tea bag. I steep for a few minutes then drink. I wait and wait and wait for about an hour. No euphoria, not even any sedation. So I decided since I just spent \$12 on this stuff, the situation called for drastic measures.



I dumped the remainder of the ounce into a pot of hot water and steeped for a while. I strained, drank, and layed in bed waiting for effects. Nothing except maybe a little sedation, but that may have just been from laying in bed.



Perhaps what I had was really low in potency, or I prepared it wrong. But for me it wasn't worth the money. Also, I believe it is an endangered species, and it's not worth their extinction attempting to get an opiate buzz that just isn't there.
