Tomorrow is going to be my first vacation in years, and I finished packing a little early\ldots so why not indulge a tad, right? I put 30mg of 2C-T-2 in a gelcap, and swallowed the cap at noon. I haven't had much luck with this substance in the past -- although, each time I've tried it was from the same 1g I recently acquired from a lab out of the country. I have purchased other chemicals from them before, and have always been very happy with the quality of their products. 



T+ :60  - First signs - I get the familiar slight tingling in the back of my head, not completely unlike the feeling I get from DXM at first. This feeling quickly passes, though, and I just get cold (as is usual for me on this substance).



T+ 2:00 - Start noticing slight trails, but conversation is completely normal. I really don't notice anything at this point other than still being cold.



T+ 3:10 - Now things are getting interesting. I just felt a little rush, which always reminds me of tryptamine rush, but not as intense. With tryptamines I know that ``there is more to come'' and it sometimes freaks me out. But with this substance I feel OK -- like it just wants to let me know it's there, but nothing else.



T+ 3:33 -- White walls have color to them, and this screen seems to be shimmering in a spectacular way. Thought process doesn't seem affected, but I can feel a definite change of consciousness. Concentration is a little skewed, and I'm having difficulty focusing on my typing.



T+ 5:00 -- Spent the last hour and change listening to music and watching TV. Music isn't really enhanced, and I don't feel especially drawn into drama on TV. The color shifting and image trails are nice, though. All that's really noteworthy is the ``off kilter'' feeling; that feeling of not knowing what is different, but knowing I'm definitely not straight. Having those usual paranoid thoughts of what ifs -- what if I never come out of it\ldots how would I go through life like this. Not nearly as pronounced as oral 5-meo-DMT experience (with Syrian Rue), but still there.



T+ 6:30 -- Coming down completely -- it happens pretty quickly for me on this stuff. The trails are stopping, colors aren't shimmering, and the mental effects are disappearing.



T+ 7:30 -- Down almost completely. Some residual visual changes, but other than that I am almost back to baseline.



T+ 8:00 -- Back to baseline, more or less. I do feel a little spacey, but just a tad -- this feeling usually lingers for a while after dosing with 2c-t-2 for me. A headache is moving in, as usual. They usually last half a day after for me.



Summary:

Another successful 2c-t-2 trip, but the highest dosage I've tried yet. The shift in consciousness was more pronounced, and was accompanied by a little confusion and scatter mindedness at this dosage. 2c-t-2 is not my favorite chemical -- its effects don't impress me much, don't leave me in a productive state of mind, and it leaves me with a pretty bad headache. As always I am reminded how great weed is, and that I think I'll stick to it for a while to come. After my vacation it's back to my dealer :-)



Safe travels, all.
