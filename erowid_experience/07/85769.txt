Having read some of the kratom experiences online, especially from the long-term users I feel I should post a partial warning on the withdrawal from this truly wonderful drug.



I have been taking kratom for about two years on and off and totally agree that it insulates the human psyche from the urban hell we have created for our race. It helped me sleep, it helped me work (out) made me a more sociable person and even stopped me drinking so much (although it does mix very nicely with alcohol).



I love that I didn't build tolerance to it but it really can be habit forming. I am an addictive person; drugs (E, whiz, legal highs, mushies, booze, caffeine), habits (exercise, sex) you name it I can get addicted to it and the same with kratom. 



The problem is there is never a good time to `come off' I perform better at work, at home with the kids, at the gym and even in bed! I used to have two days per week off and would have a little trouble sleeping on the second; I guess it had cleared my system by then. This when to one day, then none and I actually went full time about a month ago. 



I am three days into my `turkey' now and it is really bad. No sleep at all! My arms and legs are tingling and I thrash about all night, cold sweats, goosebumps. I can't sleep in bed with my wife, too twitchy.  Concentration span is next to nothing, no appetite etc. Probably a lot like coming of heroin.



Three days in and I am starting again, next time a controlled weaning I think. 10g, - 2 g per day over a week or so, never 10 g/day then zero.



Just my word of warning; kratom is a great servant but a poor master.
