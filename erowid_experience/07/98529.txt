Substance: 5-MeO-DALT hydrochloride

Subject: Male, 75 kg, 24 yo.

Meal: yogurt with muesli, banana, chestnuts; black tea; orange juice at T -0:45 (17.30). Note that I woke up at 16:45 after 8 hours sleep.

Dose: 20 mg +/- 2 (? Crappy scale) at 18:15

Set: my last day of 2 weeks of holiday, tomorrow starting a 9 months long  internship. I feel good with myself, it's a good period in my life. 

Setting: my own room in a student house, comfortable. Low lights, candles, high quality soundsystem.

Subject's background: used to LSD, some experiences with LSA, mushrooms, salvia divinorum, 2C-B. Only one experience with DOB (very overwhelming), 2C-I, and an unknown psychedelic amphetamine (it was a red star). Some stimulants: amphetamines, camfetamine, ethylphenidate, cocaine. Some downers: alcohol, ketamine, opium. Have been into weed for 6 years, now smoke once and then.
Smoked some weed the night before.

T+0 : 20mg 

T +0:23 - 18:38 -- Feeling ``something''..? relaxation. Placebo? What? Pleasant.

T +0:26 - 18:41 -- Some energy and restlessness. Then, not much..

T +1:07 - 19:22 -- 20 mg more have been ingested in a rizla bomb.

T +1:29 - 19:44 -- Feeling it more. First hot, then cold, then fine again.. developing.

T +2:00 - 20:15 -- Into it. Pleasant. Trippy. Organic. Low lights, candles, body high and relaxed state of mind. High appreciation of music. Time slowed down. Lights are enanched and senses are enanched. 

T +2:15 - 20:30: smoked one medium joint of Jack Herrer with 15 mg 5-MeO-DALT. Definitely into it. Can barely type on the keyboard. Body rush, pleasure, increased heart rate. Lay on bed and enjoy ``Atom Heart - Live In Barcelona 02/06/94''.

T +3:40 - 21:55 -- It's less intense now.. I'm out of bed. Sexual arousment. Back to bed soon.. Very pleasant high. Clear thoughts. Really into music. Uwe Schmidt is awesome (Atom Heart - Morphogenetic Fields). Thinking about eating but I'm lazy to go to the kitchen.

T +4:41 - 22:56 -- I'm definitely not baseline, but probably I just need food and water! Being in a room lightened just by candles, laying on a bed listening to ``Deathprod -- Morals and Dogma'' doesn't help being clear minded. Route to the kitchen.

T +6:17 - 00:32 -- After a good meal I'm totally fine. Almost baseline, with good energies and good mood. I feel no confusion at all, but being clever and sharp in thoughts.

Overall: nice substance. Very organic feeling, natural feeling. No intoxication feeling like amphetamines or phenethylamines. The afterglow is pleasant and natural. Smoking is more fun, fast coming up, each hit is a rush. Eating is more comfortable, slower coming up.

This substance makes me more able to listen to myself, to feel myself. I am more aware of my body and of my thoughts. No paranoia, no anorexia, no jaw clenching, just relaxed body high. Time is spaced out, the nature out of the window is more natural. 
What else to say, it seems a pleasant and easy to handle psychedelic, even if with low psychedelic activity. It's more about the body high\ldots  gentle psychedelic. It brought me to a comfortable well known place, when lights sparkle and everything is real. 

Everything seemed perfect. The disposition of the objects in my room, observed from my bed, was perfect. The posters and postcards on the wall are perfectly disposed. Sense of immanent perfection underlying in all the things.

Will try with slightly higher dosage (40mg all in once, and smoking again maybe without weed, to feel only the tryptamine. Adding this to weed joints makes the joint more fun, yet easy experience.
