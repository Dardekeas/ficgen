After my first experience eating 25mg of 2CT7 and having minimal effects my girlfreind and I decided to try smoking it.



We used a method referred to as chasing the dragon.  That is placing a small amount of powder ($\sim$1mg with 2CT7) on tin foil, heating it with a flame from beneath (do not light the flame until ready to inhale b/c 2CT7 evaporates very fast) and using a half cut off 20oz plastic bottle to inhale the evaporated smoke with. 



Although this is the method we used I have since learned that chemicals on the tin foil evapoate as well making the experience less than good for you.  I would recommend using the light bulb method, or an evaparater.  I also think the tin foil had a lot to do with the toxic, dirty effect we got.



T + 0:00  I smoke about 2-3mg for the first try not knowing how much smoke it would create.  Most of it I was unable to inhale and therefore was wasted.  I immediately notice the effects.  Everything in my perception, especially my visual field, is much more pronounced.  Having had intensley bad experinces with acid, i begin to get nervous, wondering if it is so intense already where ic ould be headed.  However, there is was no need to worry, from what I have learned of 2CT7 (from personal experience) it seems very benign to me.  



T + 0:10  We went for a walk to cool my nerves.  This worked very well, I realize there was no need to worry, I'm not going anywhere I don't want to go.  I am definately having visuals, this worked much better than ingesting.  I only used 2-3mg versus 25!  And it is working much better.  ALthough, I must admit smoking this stuff is not something I want to do often.  I immediately felt a headache, and my lungs were not happy with me when I inhaled the smoke.  Could this be the tin foil? or just the 2CT7?



T + 1:00  Having been tripping fairly steadily.  Prevalent visuals, although not extremely intense, noting like I expected from reading the user reports.  We smoke more, this time only using about 1mg per hit.  I smoke two or three hits.  I am definately tripping harder now, my headache although worse from smoking more seems to be more in the background. 



T + 1:30  Wow, this stuff is much more easy on the ego than acid.  At no point in time did I feel my world being beaten or crushed or even severly distored.  Its more like I have been given another perspective on things, ont that I like much.  I do not find this nearly as creativity inspiring as LSD either.  Not that this is neccessarily a bad thing.  I would just recommend it be used in a different way, I am much more mentally clear than acid.  



T + 2:30  I have noticed that although I smoke more the effects will only reach a certain level.  A friend who has smoked a lot of meth tells me that after a certain point smoking more doesn't have much effect.  I wonder why?  Maybe your lungs can only absorb so much?  Maybe they close off to the foreign substance somehow?  Any which way I am convinced that I can not have an experince much more intense by smoking.  



T + 4:20  Coming down now a fair amount, we are considering going to bed.  I get talked into taking a hit from the bong.  Wow!  Pot with this stuff is wild!  I'm not sure how I can describe it.  Sort of like DXM.  I feel very far away and things are certainly distorted in a way they have not been all night.  I don't really in contact with anything but my thoughts.  I hate pot.  If it weren't for the mind dulling effects of pot I think the 2CT7 \& pot combo could really be a duo.  It is worthwhile to note here that I am a person who is extremely sensitive to pot, and don't smoke it frequently.  Someone with a substanstial tolerance may not find the combo as explosive.   ALthough, a freind of mine who smokes daily is convinced that the pot took his trip somewhere he wouldn't have gone otherwise.  



Concluding comments:  Although smoking is worth further experiment, i will not again do it with tin foil.  Hopefully this will reduce the toxic effects.  I also think a combo of eating \& smoking may work best.  I have attempted this once and it has been my best experince by far.  I intend to do a report of it soon, so keep your eyes open.  =)
