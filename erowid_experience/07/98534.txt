Background: Have tried countless substituted amphetamines, phenethylamines and tryptamines over the decades in moderate doses



Experience: A bunch of us had gone to another city for a psychedelic festival to wrap up the festival season. 



10pm We've just finished the yoga set and a delightful vegan meal served to us with poetry and acoustic music, the opening ceremony for the festival is about to begin. I go to the washroom and drop 1 cap of mdma and place a 400ug* tab of 25C-NBOMe under my tongue until it disintegrates then swallow it.



10:30 before the opening ceremony is finished I'm getting restless standing in a circle holding hands, find I am blinking a lot



11:30 we've gone over to the electro swing stage where the music is more upbeat and it also where the bar is. Dancing is effortless, my mood is very buoyant, able to connect with others on the dance floor around me. Feeling just supreme. Feeling very openhearted.



1:00 decide I want to ramp the experience up a notch I place a 2nd 400ug blotter under my tongue until it disintegrates.



1:30: The music has gotten heavier now, more a psytance vibe, the crowd has become more reptilian ,I seem to have the ability to weave in and out of a very crowded dance floor effortlessly without missing a beat. Feeling wonderful



2:00am My lady friend has enough and decides to head back to the hotel room, so I drop another cap of mdma and go out on the terrace and smoke a joint of pot that has been infused with di-ethyl tryptamine. Not sure how much, but it was a big one, and usually one this size I would only smoke 1/3 and save the rest for later, but this time I kept on smoking until it is gone. The friend I was smoking with couldn';t even smoke anymore, he passed. I start to feel a little claustrophobic stuck in conversation with a few people and escape back to the dance floor. As soon as I get to the dance floor, it hits me and the world explodes into pixeled tracers and everything goes crazy, almost like the tail end of a dmt trip when you can't be sure if your eyes are open or closed. I'm thinking, there is no way I can navigate through the crowded dance floor, everything has gone completely haywire. But as soon as I get on the floor I decide to dance my way across, and same as before I am totally in the groove and the movements are effortless, but I am totally blown away. I am on autopilot now. I experience no anxiety though. This is heavy tripping but sooooo fine.  A buddy comes up and I am able to have a conversation with him, despite tripping out heavily, The pixelated  dmt-esque tracers persist.



2:30 I head back to the main dance floor where Askhan is wrapping up his set. I find the whole crew from my city all together and join them on the floor. The music is beyond sublime. It reaches way down inside me and massages my soul to the very core of my being. I can see the music when I close my eyes. I become the music. I am in a blissed out cocoon of pure energy I am elemental now. Yet when I look around at all my friends on the floor I can totally connect with them. This state of being is no barrier to communication. This girl I've never met before comes up to me and throws her arms around me a gives me a huge wet kiss on the lips then another hug. She explains that my smile is soooo amazing that it makes her feel great and she is kissing me out of gratitude or how my smile makes her feel.



3:30 Everywhere I look I am surrounded by smiling people. There are no cliques, every group is wide open. At the end of each song everyone on the floor is hugging and kissing one another. I've never been to anything like this. The room is about to explode with love. I can see my bliss reflected on so many faces and the faces where I see it we lock eyes and we know, we just know, we are connected, we are one and it is all sooo beautiful. I never want this to end.



4:30 Still on the floor, but legs are beginning to ache. The peak is now over and I decide not to redose. I promised to take my lady friend for breakfast and don't want to disappoint. Dancing is still effortless, but am making much smaller movements now, the dance is becoming more internal than external. Still connecting with folk on the dance floor, but less energetically. When I take a break, I don't have as much to contribute to conversations. I am more into just being than relating right now.

I would like to sit down in the plounge area, but the visual distortion makes it difficult to discern people from cushions so I refrain from trying to navigate a room full of people crashed out on the floor. There is no where to sit down \ldots



5:30: The visual disturbances have died down now and I go to get my coat from the coat check several times, but each time I pause and look back, only to find myself slowly beginning to dance and flowing back onto the floor. I smoke a joint but don't really notice any change in my state.



6:00 I'm ready to go, but in a strange city not knowing the taxi number or how to spell the street name where I am. Dealing with all that seems like a bigger more daunting task than it normally would. When I ask the bouncer for help he informs me there are taxis lined up outside. And sure enough when I go out there are dozens of taxis.



10am I've been lying in bed since 6:30 but not able to sleep. So decide to get up and go for breakfast. Sure glad I am taking the train home instead of driving.



7pm Back at home now, sleeeeep at long last



* the 25c-NBOMe blotters was prepared by dissolving 20mgs of 25c-NBOMe in 4mls of 100\% ethanol. The using an eyedropper, which dispenses 50, drops of ethanol/ml, four drops where placed on each blotter, allowing the blotters to dry between drops.
