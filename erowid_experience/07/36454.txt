Setting: College Apartment in Tampa with Dali paintings and 5 friends experienced in tripping.



Mindset: Testing/Openminded willing to push the envelope.



Preparation: German mg scale and cut with 200 mg's effedrine and  softpressed with pencil pressure, isopropy alchohol, melted capsules,  and  compressed using plastic cylinders on a'0' size capsule filling machine.



15mg's was also prepared in plastic dime baggie weighted with mg scale, and snorted with straw.



Prescription Medications Taken Daily:  1 Aderal 20mg XR every morning and 1 Xanax generic 1mg when aniexty attacks occur.



Initial Dose \& Time: 10 mg soft pressed tablet 4:00pm

  

4:30pm-No intial effects



5:00pm-Still no physical or mental effects



5:30pm-2 more softpressed 10mg tablets taken



6:00pm-slight speedy sensation like that of an amphetamine rush. No nausea, vomiting or physical/mental effects



6:45pm-2 doses of 30mg's messured out in two dime baggies.  I snort one baggie and half of the other bagie that the other dose(e) couldn't finish himself.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



5:13am- back at the apartment the 15 year old also had a girlfriend he had brought over for the night. He kept asking if we were tripping and saying things like fuck you,\ldots .and shut-up to try to make us trip harder or just plain get mad at him. At one point he asked to take his girl in my bedroom and proceed to fuck her in my bed and that was the breaking point. I began screaming and telling him to shut up and he kept challenging me for some reason. Well it got to a point where I pulled my hangun out on him full blown vissuals and paranoia and he pulled his gun on me as well,\ldots .my friends interjected to a point where we both put out handguns down and they locked them in a small safe at the back of the apartment.



6:56am-we come to an agreement to rid our selves of the 15 year old and his whore for the evening. 2 of my friends barrow my car and drop him off when \$20 at a burger king. While I was still in the apartment I would up taking 5 more xanax's to sleep off the rest of the trip which was getting agonizely painful as the nausea and teath clentching began to return.





9:00pm- I awaken to see my girlfriend lying next to me still tripping and I'm still tripping a tiny bit with minimal tracers and and color distortions.



After going back to sleep I awoke at 2:37pm the next day and concered the minus the nausea and phyiscal pain and drama with the gun that I had enjoyed the experience. 



It's now been a year after begining my journey with 5-meo-amt. I didn't ever do over 3-10mg's again but i found that after use I would build a tollerence and have persitent pain in my chest and kidney area's and lung area's too. This would only occure if I didnt take 5-meo-amt every other week,..and would discontiue if i fasted off the substance for over a month.
