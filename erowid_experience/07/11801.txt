We started the evening with a small miniature bottle of Absinthe that I ordered from a store in the Czech Republic.  They had advertised it as `the best quality', so we had high hopes.  A friend and I mixed it according to the French ritual (pour one shot absinthe into a glass, and pour in three shots of water over a slotted spoon w/sugar or a sugar cube).  The taste was very interesting - like nothing I had ever tried.  I can't really describe it due to lack of something to compare it against.  However, I did notice that it leaves a somewhat bitter, oily aftertaste in the mouth which abates in a few minutes.  This absinthe reminded me of Sambuca; the anise smell was very strong, like licorice. 



We slowly drank the absinthe, relaxing.  The entire scene was very pleasant, a few friends over for an evening.  Almost immediately after finishing the drink, I felt my tongue go somewhat numb.  I felt immediately relaxed, completely relaxed - even more than with marijuana.  Warmth and a feeling of peace spread throughout my body.  The absinthe also numbed my body somewhat; very similar to the effects of alcohol (this brand of absinthe, with a picture of Van Gogh on the label, was 150 proof), but with an underlying warmth that just isn't there when you're intoxicated.  As I mentioned, it was a relaxing, peaceful warmth, and I had general feelings of everything being completely fine and right in the world.



About 45 minutes later, we also passed several bowls between a few friends.  My friend and I both noticed that we were more alert than usual (we're both somewhat experienced smokers), able to focus and understand things very clearly, even when we were very high.  Normally, I feel quite a bit of paranoia every once in a while; it seemed like the absinthe negated that effect.  We remained totally and completely relaxed the entire time, and it was a very pleasant, enriching feeling.  Overall we both felt very clear, and that time was progressing `slow and steady' rather than the microamnesia that sometimes occurs with marijuana.  We both had very interesting conversations relating to the fact that my friend and I could both very clearly understand each other and pose interesting questions about what effects the absinthe + THC was having.



In conclusion, it was a very rewarding experience.  I would like to explore the effects of absinthe in greater detail - since we only had a miniature bottle, we didn't have enough for more drinks, but we plan on ordering a 750mL bottle and having an old-fashioned absinthe party.
