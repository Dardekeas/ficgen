I had eaten only half hour before, which will probably affect how the med will work. 



4:30 PM. Crushed 12.5 mg Ambien CR taken with soda.



5:00p



I  feel mostly normal. Just a little different, kind of relaxed, bit more carefree. I crush another 12.5mg Ambien CR and take it.



5:30pm



I am  beginning to feel the affects. From the total 25mg



I am not really feeling sleepy, but if I were to lay down, I probably could fall asleep quickly. If that makes sense. My body feels heavy, walking is somewhat awkward\ldots in slow speed. Motor skills affected. Different than when drunk. When I attempt to do something on the computer, it takes me much longer than usual to do so. Sometimes find myself `spacing out' in thoughts for brief moments. Also, staring at nothing in general and seeing subtle movements/transformations of the objects. Looking into the laptop screen in a darkened room. The windows and the writings seem to move around a bit 3 dimensionally. 



7:30: I feel the effects start to wear off some after 3 hours from the initial pill. So I had another one crushed 12.5mg more. 



8:30: crushed and took 25mg (total since start 62.50)



Looking at normal objects they seem different. I am in my own apartment and very aware it is my place, but sort of feel some king of displacement from it. As I am typing this, the lines I am writing are slowly curving back and forth like a slithering snake. I keep forgetting where I have placed cigarettes and lighter, even though it has been in the same spot for the past hour. 



The occasional visual hallucinations are neat to see. I am feeling very relaxed and care free. I can't type quite as fast as usual otherwise I'll make too many mistakes. Motor skills def affected. Totally different from alcohol though, as I don't have problem with walking or typing when drunk. When drunk, my balance feels off a bit, but I am able to keep it managed enough that it isn't a problem. With Ambiem, it seems the motor control is slowed. Arms hands legs and feet feel heavier. Movement feels like slow motionnnn. 



I decided to walk over to the store around the corner to get some snacks. Walking outside I still felt that sense of self displacement as I slowly stumbled over to the store. Walking long distances like that, I can definitely see the comparisons between being drunk and Ambien's affects. My voice sounds mostly normal and unaffected.



10:30pm: crushed 36.5mg and took it with soda



This should probably be my last `test' dose and at some point I will probably go to sleep lol. Within 30 minutes I tired and heavy all over. Sleep is calling my name. I decide to try and stay up and lay down on the couch and watch a movie\ldots .I didn't make it too long, as I was alseep by 11:20.



6:45 AM: Wide Awake, well rested and ready for an other day! No hangover or after effects.
