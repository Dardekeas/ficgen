Used: Peruvian Torch Cactus Cuttings boiled in 1 liter of water along with 1oz of powdered Peruvian Torch cactus.



Method: Chew and Swallow.



-------------------------------

| Began Ingestion at 5:04pm    |

| Finished at 5:19pm           |

-------------------------------



5:53pm - Notices lights brighter and such.



6:21pm - Head begins to get tingly, moving aross shoulders.



6:31pm - Notice a light sense of giddyness.



7:02pm - Somewhat blurred vision. Altered state of mind definately present, series of goosebumps all over        body quite often.



7:59pm - Christmas tree flashed red and then back to green (the tree itself/without the lights), floor        looked, and moved like water.



8:37pm - Computer screen wavey, lining of anything straight edged is moving\ldots 



9:22pm - Visuals are definately present now. `Breathing Walls', colorfull patterns, yet my mind still        seems clear-headed.



9:58pm - Very intense now. Pulsing vision (objects growing large, then small in a pulsing fashion.) Hard        to type, or make out what is being typed.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[December 24th - The Next Day.] - This is where I was unable to continue updating the experience report live. So I am having to come back now and fill in the gaps.



After my last entry, things became quite intense. I experienced what I would call a vision of sort. I saw three beings, or entities. One I understood its name to be `The Everseeing Eye', and looked like a floating eyeball with eyelid turned on its side with a brownish-green aura around it. I understood it to be sort of the witness to the experience of mescaline. Like whether it is a good or bad experience, it is there to watch you. 



Another was what I understood to be, `The One' and I understood it to be sort of like a judge over whether or not you will be blessed with a good or bad experience. It looked like some sort of Hawaiian ritual mask or something, a floating one that is.



Then there was the last entity, the one I understood to be known as, `Sin'. I understood it to be what `The One' uses to grant you a bad experience if it deems you deserve it or not. `Sin' looked like a completely black head with a cut in its forehead and one, red, menacing eye.



These entities are what I understood to be the entities of the cactus. Before I had ingested the cactus, I said a quick Shamanistic Prayer, if you will to grant me a good experience and sure enough, I was given one.



I spent the entire time after this vision drawing the entities and writing down everything I could remember from the vision before I was overwhelmed and forgot or something.



After writing down everything I could remember, I put on some KoRn and listened to music for about 4 hours. 



The effects are still felt even as I type this. Mescaline is a very strong drug and should not be taken lightly.
