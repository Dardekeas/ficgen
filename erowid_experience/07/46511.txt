I am a 30 year old business man who has not done any mind altering drugs in about 10 years.  I have looked for Mesc and LSD but I have been out of the scene too long and I cannot find it.  This led me to research chemicals. The first one I tried was 5-meO-DMT but that substance was not enjoyable to me.  Through research I decided 2c-e looked like my cup of tea.  



I ordered 100mg and repaired a 10mg/ml sterile solution for injection using a drop of Benzyl Alcohol mixed with sterile water.  Then I dissolved the 2c-e in the solution and pushed it through a sterile syringe filter.  Now all I had to do was waiting for the right time to try the substance.  I have a wife and a child so I can't go getting high when ever I want.  



The day came where my wife and son would be out of the house for 5 hours.  I figured I would start at the threshold dose for snorting it.  I used an insulin syringe to load up 2mg and injected into my leg.  2 minutes later I could feel the affects.  I peaked in about 30 mins and I would compare the affect to that of a really good tab of mescaline.  I had a really nice euphoria, with mild open eye visuals and nice closed eye visuals.  The entire trip lasted 3 hours with lingering affects for the rest of the evening.  



I am glad that I tried such a small dosage because I was contemplating 10mg for a good trip.  Now I think 5mg would get me to +3 and 8mg would be the absolute max I would want to go.
