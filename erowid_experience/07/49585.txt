inhaled

waited.



how much time had pass?



HOLYFUCKINGCHRISTALMGIHTYDONTPULLMETHATFAST!

screaming fury

a roar all around



got me a moving; ohhohoho

o man; here we gogogogo go



-hold on little one

     lead me sally

-that i will



the field of vision; dark

twenty seconds..

errupting color

the emptyness, 

sparkeles to life

vibrant fucking life



tunnels; tunnels errupting everywhere

intertwining vines;

mirror images; 

so many vines?

so many patterns\ldots 

they shoot back, back into infinity

   these numbers know no bounderies\ldots 

they hold no limits

that i see; which i have sought

   there the bending tree

times; howmany times?  it etched backwards

this bending tree; 

fire; ablaze in glory

greens; strange hues; strange sensations\ldots 



voices all around; whispers of here and there

discussing the anywho's

the what nots of life



patterns; decending upon me

at terriable speed and unstopable furry

 the end of the tunnel

    breakthrough..



hyperspace.



   ITS BREEDING?!

HOLY JESUS im feeding it 

     no use stopping

   no one can stop it



`you cant stop me you cant stop me you cant stop me'

I dont want to

`follow me follow me follow me'

        down the winding winding path



what is this that i see?

strange reality; 

purple; colors; entities have come

I float through a field 

strange vibes

strange glows

time; its as existant as a one dimentional object



ahah ; there we  have it; two sides of the circle; a floating syphony of elves 

and throbbing orbs



still I ascend to heights

I had no intention of reaching

an all to familiar sensation..

splicing



my feet; miles away

me torso; segmented beyond belief

cakleling laughter: YOU CANT STOP IT

  no; your right; I cant stop it

I merely hold on

this hurricane of exotic chemicals

unleashed upon my head;



how long has it been?

that concept has merely faded



then the true contacct was made;

the one that i was ment to see

the thing i was ment to behold

I had come

the pullsing edge of DMT hyperspace

so near; the vaulting speed of lady ska

so strong.

pushing; pushing

if i was already in hyperspace?

where was this place i was going to?



memory fades\ldots 

there is no level

no single analogy

that will ever mark; that will ever come close to

retelling this lizard Kingdome

this Kingdome come; 

this realm of two worlds



fabric; the fabric tears

sickening shudders

violent shakes

tunnels; i continue down more and more

elves; fucking elves

they cant keep their fucking pants on

erotic fucks\ldots 

   I love it



merging with space

no refriderators\ldots 

this is 

far more\ldots 

galactic proportions

cosmic visions



before me stands a temple

infinitely high

infinitely large

climbing up it

lizards; of varying color

I travel around it; warping

pulsating beats

are those drums I hear?



   BOOMSHAKLAKA MOTHERFUCKER NO TURNING BACK

conversations

misty conversations; sweep upon me; sweet familiarity

fearful alieniess

is that a word?

what is a word?

logos?

what are those?

Christ; spinning and spinning



colors.



vibrant colors



odd de ja vu

familiarity

I am meeting an old friend; how about some tea?

no tea tonight

no rest for those who test the limits

what are the limits?

the end; ahaha; no concept of an end

circling this ancient structure

I am content on 

simply completing my orbit; round

and round the merrygoround

then we all fall down.

down?



viscious speed



decending into the structure

throbbing masses

entangled patterns

I see Mayan symbols

cosmically huge patterns

they rotate

to my left a smelve (smelve?  aha; he is built of DMT likes; ska personality; freindly; benignly watching me)

he points

I look

the patterns before my field of vision

 begin to extend backwards

and backwards

mirror images

then a kaleidoscope of colors

rotating inwards

jumping glee

euphoria.



then it turns.

jesus fuck; how long has it been?!

lady ska departs; slowly; notcibly

familiar DMT patterns

familiar DMT entities

a purple room; I stare through tinted glass

inside are desks with knobs

and things i dont remember

mirror images extend backwards\ldots .



how long has it been!?!?!?!??!!?



blackout



why do we throw it all away?



Conclusion:

I blacked out after 10 minutes according to my sitter.

The Salvia never left; the point where I begin to feel as though its presence is leaving is marked by the arrival of a Level Six in combination with a truly magnificent dosage of DMT.  I simply forgot I was on drugs.  Therefore I merged with the high and accepted it as my eternal state of mind.



This trip did not teach me anything; it did not open up any new insights into life.  What it did was take my mind so far past the limits to places never before imagined.  This was a psychic journey in a literal sense.  I wasn't out to find any answers; I was merely an explorer.  And that is exactly what I did.



Unimaginably intense.



The trip itself rivaled that of le Belladonna.
