Last weekend my buddy tried his first mind altering substance while i was just really trying blue lotus.  I had made blue lotus twice before but i microwaved it in a teaglass instead of boiling it.  i found it much more convenient if you hate waiting.  the first time i used about a gram of blue lotus in about a cup of water, it was mood enhancing but nothing very good.  the second time i upped it to about 1.5grams in a cup, drank it and 20 minutes later decided to play a video game, about 5 minutes into my game my hands lock up and all i can do is stare, it was quite an exhilerating experience as a matter of fact, but this was just the beginning.  about a week later my friend and i said hey what the hell lets boil up some lotus, so we let the lotus sit in boiling water for about 5 minutes this dosage was about 3 grams.  we drank about 2 pints each and laid down, i felt rather floaty and very cheerful.  that night i chewed a large quid of salvia i think that the lotus enhanced this experience as i received stronger visuals than i ever have when i used salvia.  The visuals were actually quite wierd but i was a bit giggly but had a good time.  



the next night was quite a good night.  my same friend and i boiled up about a liter with 3.5-4 grams of leaf.  we let it boil for 10 minutes then poured into a mountain dew bottle and brought it to a party.  my friend and i drank half the bottle each then immediately walked into the party, i drank a beer and so did he, i can speak for me that once drinking the first gulp i immediately fealt joyous and everyone had a great aura, if anyone is going to make tea out of this, make sure you drink a beer afterwards, it produced very very desirable results, my friend drank 6 beers and im sure he and his girlfriend appreciated my lotus hehe.  later that night, i smoked a lot of salvia which i think bogged down most of the lotus, i smoked about 10-16 bowls of salvia and then was being disturbed by someone else, i wanted to be at peace but it was disturbed, i got a headache that night but i think that the lotus did not cause it, if you are looking for a substance that will make you happier, less worriful, and all around better, look no further than blue lotus, this has to be the flower of god
