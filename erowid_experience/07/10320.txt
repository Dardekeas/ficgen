This is sort of an odd story. You're probably thinking:is this kid trying to kill himself? Well at the time of this experience, yes.



INTRO:



It was the middle of october and things had not gone too well at all. I was more depressed than I have ever been in my life so far. I was homeless and pennyless. Then I thought I had finally gotten my break and was allowed to move back into my families house. It felt so good to be back. I hadn't been on my computer for atleast 7 or 8 months. So I decided to go through my bookmarked sites to see what was new and if they still existed and what they were (I didn't remember what alot of them were about). The next morning I woke up all happy only to find out my mom had gone onto my computer and scrolled through my cache and had seen what she assumed was some sort of drug recipe sight and told me I had to leave.



At that point my whole world collapsed and I lost it. I smashed my computer, a big screen TV, many CDs, and took off. I walked to a drug store (about a mile and a half),ganked a package of EZ-DOZE and downed all 30 pills. Now I know that I am supposed to take prescription sleeping drugs if I want to commit suicide but I figured it couldn't really hurt to try these and they both make you sleep right? So why not.



I began walking around to find a place where I could be alone and gather my thoughts as I(hopefully)slip away into the afterlife or nothingness. It started getting dark but I was suprisingly not cold or tired yet. It must have been atleast 1/2hr to 45min since I took all those pills and I had an empty stomach so why isn't it working yet?



THE TRIP:



As I was walking to my surprise my energy level was building quite rapidly. I knew then that anything close to death was out of the question and that I couldn't even nap if I wanted to. That is when the most bizarre trip I have ever had took place.



I started getting visuals which intensified pretty quickly. Things would swirl around, I'd look at the road and the pavement would swirl around and move around in all kinds of directions. But it wasn't like acid,shrooms,or dmt, where things would flow like liquid and swirl beautifly, it was in fast,jerky,eratic,violent motions that would move around quite intensly and then disappear almost and then come back seconds later. In front of me I could see this transparent blob moving around. It was really weird, it was moving around really fast and would fly around and contort itself like a giant ameoba. It would hover about 20ft up in the air infront of me and little bubbles would fly around it. It kind of reminded my of the movie predator only it was just a giant formless blob and it appeared so real as if I could grab it if it got close enough to me.



Other wierd things would happen, like cars scared the shit out of me. I could sense if a car was coming and how close it was to me so I would assume that once it got close to me I wouldn't be scared because I was anticipating it. But sure enough everytime a car would pass me a would jump out of my skin, like when I'm walking and someone jumps out and scares me. The sky would turn bright blue sometimes and I kept thinking it was daytime even though I knew it was night. It also felt REALLY wierd to put my hands in my pockets. Sometimes I'd just stand there with my hands in my pockets and bug out because it felt so strange like gravity and matter no longer existed, it's a little too wierd to describe. I was also really fucked up but I've been more fucked up before so it wasn't something I couldn't handle.



Even though this was all very interesting it was getting really cold out and I needed to go somewhere. I had 1 quarter to call someone. So I called my dad. I didn't say I was tripping, just that I had taken 30 sleeping pills and when I talked I sounded really fucked so he brought me to the hospital. By the time I got there I was completely sober. I tried to tell my dad and the guy at the emergency room desk that I was straight to go. But they both assumed I was crazy and insisted that I stay. I drank that awfull charcoal shit and they stuck the needles in my arms and did their analysis.

I had to goto a special mental hospital after that for a few weeks before they would allow my to return to the outside world. Fortunatly things got better after that.



I was very fortunate to live and I believe I got a 2nd chance at life.
