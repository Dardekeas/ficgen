I had ordered a large bag of hb woodrose seeds from a website and had tried them once with very mild results.  The first time that I had taken them I did seven.  This time I decided to crush up ten seeds and soak them in water for an hour.  At 5:00pm I drank the water and ate the seed gunk at the bottom of the glass.  Then I proceeded to play final fantasy for about an hour.  Almost exactly an hour after ingesting I just could not play the game anymore.  My hands and arms felt very heavy and I was having a hard time holding my head up.  I turned off the game and headed to my room to lay in bed for a bit while waiting for a friend to call me to go out.  At this point I almost totally lost track of the time, but this is everything that I can recall.



I started to feel really nauseated, but I wasn't really worried.  I tried to get up to go to the bathroom and almost fell over!  The backs of my legs had severly cramped up and I had to limp to the bathroom.  No amount of rubbing or walking could work out the terrible pain in the back of my legs.  When I got to the bathroom I tried to throw up, knowing I would feel better after, but no matter how hard I tried I just could not throw up.  So I dragged myself out of the bathroom and back in bed.  I hadn't noticed it happening but my nose had become so stuffed up that I could hardly breath out of it.  My friend call me at a quarter to eight and at that point I had to turn her down.  I was naseated, unable to breathe out of my nose, and I had to pee every five minutes.  The woodrose wasn't done with me yet.  Within a half hour I was so dizzy and light-headed that I couldn't even sit up in bed.  At one point I got up to use to bathroom and had to crawl the short distance, because if I had walked I would have fainted.  I also had a terrible headache which lasted for all of the next two days.   



Throughout the evening none of these bad experiences ever subsided.  It was awful.  Things might have been more tolerable if maybe the nausea or cramping ended, but neither did.  At 10:00pm, right before I passed out into sleep, I was experiencing all of it, plus nothing I looked at would stay still.  I wouldn't call it visuals, but everything just seemed to be shifting.  I would stare at a corner of my blanket and it would seem to just be shifting around.  



The whole time this was going on I had the gotten into the mindset that it was never going to end.  I thought I was going to continue the awful experience for the rest of my life.  Eventually, I became too worn out and light-headed to even care anymore.  Right before I fell asleep I got up one last time to use the bathroom and nearly fell down while trying to pull my bathrobe out of the closet.  I had been laying around in my underwear because I was feeling too warm in my clothes\ldots exactly how you would feel with a high fever.  I remember spending ten minutes kneeling in front of the toilet just staring into the water during that bathroom trip.  I still could not make myself throw up.  Thankfully, I managed to fall asleep after that (something I had not been able to do up until that point).  



It was the worst experience of my life.  Strangely, I haven't sworn off woodrose seeds, I will just never do more than five or six ever again.  The physical pain was just too much for me to want a woodrose experience to more than just mild.



One last note:  I know this experience seems like the minority and people might be tempted to ignore it, but the first time I did it I was with three people and two of them had very similiar experiences as my bad one.  One person's bad experience only lasted two hours and then became wonderful, but the other person was confined to bed for the rest of the evening.  Neither of them had done any other substance that night.

If you decide to try woodrose be careful!  Don't be tempted to take too many on the first try.  Get to know how your body reacts to it first.

Peace
