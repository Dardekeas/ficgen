I first tried Gabapentin about 2 years ago when my wife got a prescription for carpal tunnel syndrome. She was not taking them, so I decided to try them out for myself. I began by taking 5 300mg capsules on an empty stomach.

	

The effects took about 1-2 hours to fully kick in. What I experienced was a very relaxed, mellow feeling. I felt slightly zombied out, but I was so relaxed that this didn't bother me. To me, the feeling was superior to all of the benzo's I have tried. 

	

Despite the heavy relaxation I experienced, I found that I still had a lot of energy. Doing regular activities proved no problems, and sex was definitely better. I was able to last a lot longer, because my nerve sensations were dulled. I continued this for several nights until I ran out of pills. There were no withdrawal symptoms, and I had no hangover the next day. I also discovered that even though the drug didn't make me tired, I was able to fall asleep fast, and stay asleep the entire night.

	

Recently, I developed nerve inflammation in my lower back, which caused severe pain in my left leg. When I asked my doctor about trying Gabapentin, he had no problems prescribing it to me, and I now had my own continuous supply! This time, I decided to up the dose to 15-20 of the 300mg capsules. The effects were slightly different. After about an hour,I began to feel a pleasant tingling in my limbs accompanied by a feeling of well-being similar to that of opiates. After about an hour of this, I felt the same relaxed, zombied feeling described above. I found that drinking a lot of water intensified the high. Smoking cigarettes while on this drug also seemed to intensify my buzz.

	

Some of the negative effects I experienced were that tolerance developed rapidly. Taking the same dose of Gabapentin the next day didn't even produce half the high, and was a waste of pills. I found that waiting 2 days between doses seemed to bring tolerance back down to normal. Another bad effect I noticed was that I felt kinda jittery and paranoid when I began to come down. I also became very obsessive-compulsive, having to constantly arrange things in a certain order.

	

The really good things about Gabapentin were that it seemed to open me up. I wanted to call friends, and talk to my wife all the time. I was also able to do some introspection, and resolve issues about myself that were bothering me. Another good thing about Gabapentin is that the effects would last very long, about 8 to 10 hours from coming up to coming down. I find that it is good to take this stuff first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Also, it really did help with my nerve pain, better than my Norco and Percocet, in fact.
