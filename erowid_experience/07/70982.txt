So one night at a club with some friends, one of them offered me a couple of Zoloft as she noted I seemed `a little down'. Normally I don't take things prescribed to other people, but this once I figured `what the hell' and did it anyway. Not alot happened after that - my mood improved a little but that may have had something to do with the few drinks I had; not enough to get drunk but enough to loosen up a bit.



Cut to the next morning. I haven't been able to sleep all night. My jaw aches from clenching my teeth. All my muscles feel like they're taut to the point of snapping. I'm jittery, walking is a joke as my legs ache. I'm jumpy like I've just slammed back 10 cups of coffee and everything seems too bright. I felt like that for 2 GODDAMN DAYS. After 200mg of Zoloft.



All I want to know is why the hell do they prescribe this shit and what excuse could anyone possibly have for wanting to take it more than once?
