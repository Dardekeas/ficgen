I've been smoking cannabis for the past nine years. I'm 29 years old. I've done salvia; opiates; alcohol; nitrous oxide gas; dextromethorphan; `antidepressants' such as desyrel, buspar, etc; diphenhydramine\ldots 



My first experiences with cannabis were immensely mind-blowing, showing me an entirely different way of looking at reality. But over the years I became so accustomed to the psychedelic effects of the mild-to-weak potency stuff I was getting that being high eventually became my normal state of mind, and I'd feel anxious and slowed down when I couldn't get any. 



One experience with the chronic (high-grade hydroponic stuff) made me realize the overwhelming potential was still there, but I never had enough at one time to fully trip out. Whenever I'd run out, and go without (against my will) for a few days, maybe a week or two at most, I'd feel a taste of that origianal, glowing force again, but soon I'd be back in my rut of `staying high'---Barely appreciating the plant's effects as anything but a means to shutting out the boredom and tedious frustrations of waking reality. 



Then, this year (2008), my connection suddenly dried up, and I was left without cannabis for over a month. I went through a brief, irritaing `withdrawal', and I knew that when I finally got some it was going to be intense again, but I had no idea it was going to be an entire quarter-ounce of the most potent, crystaline chronic imaginable! 



The stuff was expensive, but well worth it. I took one look at the bright green, purple-and-orange-haired, THC-crystalized buds and knew this was going to be intense. After one hit I was flying. The second hit brought on orgasmic waves of electric pleasure, lighting up all neural connections---Sure enough, I was rambling like a first timer. Successive hits blasted me with rushing waves of paranoiac death-fear (pleasurable at the same time). I put a Tricky (Adrian Thaws, not that new rip-off who stole his name) mix CD and sat on my bed Indian-style, spouting every thought that came into my head a hundred words per-minute. The buzz was intense. 



My cat jumped on my bed and suddenly it occured to me to start writing a new Alice story. I grabbed a red sharpie marker and my steno-notebook and the first dozen pages flowed out of me like dictation. A recent dream in which I kept `waking up' over and over, only to realize I'd still been dreaming recurred to me, and I knew this would make the perfect plot-device; every morning Alice awakens to realize the previous day had been `only a dream'---But the further back her memories go, the less certain she is of whether something was really a dream or not---I haven't been excited enough to write longhand in years---But it's like a puzzle, I keep automatically returning to our `Real Rord vs. Multiple Dream Worlds' dichotomy, contradicting myself, and having to scribble things out\ldots  (I actually enjoy WRITING longhand, it's reading and transcribing it onto the computer which I find torturous)\ldots 



Anyway, I now intend to use cannabis respectfully, like I use salvia; maybe once a week or so, getting the full effects, and learning from each experience, instead of puffing away constantly every day, and burning myself out on it. This is a wonderful and powerful plant, and it deserves much respect.
