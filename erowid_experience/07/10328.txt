My experience with sleep deprivation took place about 7 years ago.  I was working as a night watchman at a hotel and for some strange reason I decided to help out a friend who was going out of town for a few days and mind his store during the day.  For 5 days I worked at the hotel from 2:00 pm to 8:00 am and at my friends store from 9:00 am -- 1:00 pm, so I was working 21 hour a day!  I drank coffee and smoked cigarettes all the time and dosed off maybe 10 minutes once in awhile.

	

The last night I was working was the worst, I started hallucinating.  I was walking around to see if everything was okay, and I saw the Spiderman running across the hall (red and blue costume and everything).  I followed him to investigate but there was nobody there.  Later that night I thought there was a party going on in the kitchen (I heard party-noises), the damn cooks are drunk again, I thought and stormed in there to stop the party.  There was nobody there and the lights were off and everything.



When I finished the morning after I had to drive 20 km across Icelandic country roads.  I thought I was dying and I would never make it home but I did, luckily, and then I slept for 20 hours and woke up with a hangover.  My friends didn't believe me when I told them I had seen the Spiderman, I was probably could have died from sleep deprivation or fallen asleep at the wheel. The experience was uncomfortable and dangerous.
