I am a 32 year old mother of 2 young boys, now 6 and 4.  I also received my graduate education in nursing from one of the world's leading universities.  With marital problems and the normal every day stress of being a mother, I began to experience extreme generalized anxiety.  I was initially placed on Lexapro.  It was great, but made me too tired to function.  My PCP recommended Paxil but I quickly learned it did nothing for me.  I then started Effexor 37.5mg XR once every day.  It too made me very tired.  But it also made me feel sedate.  I figured out that if I took it at bedtime, I was able to sleep better than I had ever before.  My PCP raised the does to 75mg XR once a day.  I was off and running.  



I experienced a warm chilling sensation over my entire body at random times.  It was a good feeling.  Weird, but good.  I had an increase in my appetite.  Nothing crazy, I had a 5 lb. weight gain as a result.  I had mild headaches during the first 2 to 3 weeks of begining the drug.  I was more even tempered and patient with my children.  Life was good.



I begin to experience a strange sensation after about a month or so of taking Effexor.  If I missed a dose, I would notice at random times a visual vibration.  The best way I can describe this is if you have ever watched a football game on TV, occasionally the players hit into a camera just enough that we see the picture vibrate.  Or taking home video and the person doing the filming is shaking slightly.  I have heard similar descriptions called `brain shivers', `electric buzzes', `shock waves', `electric shocks', vertigo, and nystagmus.  I am assuming nystagmus is what it really is.  When these `shivers' occur, they happen (to me) rapidly and last anywhere from 1 to 3 seconds.  Their frequency seems to be directly related to falling blood levels.  If I missed 1 dose, they were not as frequent nor lasting as if I had missed 3 or 4 doses.  



This `shiver' or nystagmus as I believe, was fairly troubling as I tried to withdraw from the medication.  But there was something else I experienced as more painful and bothersome.  First let me complicate the story with the addition of another medication.  After being on the Effexor for about 6 months or so, and seeing a therapist I was Dx. as having ADD (NOT attention deficit Hyperactivity disorder).  I was placed on 30mg of Adderall XR (I tried one of my nanny's one occassion and thought, wow! someone turned the lights on!).



Anyway, I continued on this regime for another year and a half and decided I would try to come off the Effexor.  I tried the cold turkey method.  After 2 weeks of `brain shivers' I began to experience the chills again only they were not the pleasent sensation I remembered when I first started the drug.  I began to experience the chills multiple times of the day.  They happened usually in the morning after I showered when I was standing in front of my sink doing my hair and make up.  I could feel the sensation start at my feet and like a wave go all the way up to my neck and over my scalp.  I would get the erector pili response as well (goose bumps).  It literally felt as though the hair on my head was on end.



It was a warm rush but I felt ice cold.  I mean like someone immersed me in ice cold water but internally I was very hot.  I would become dizzy as well.  On 2 occassions, I experienced a sudden onset of abdominal cramping, severe nausea, severe dizziness, profuse sweating to the point of soaking my shirt and sweat literally dripping onto the floor.  I know enough to realize I was begining to lose consciousness.  I was also hyperventilating.  When the episodes would (thankfully) subside, my face and hands were ghastly white and my lips were grayish.  More than likely I experienced a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure.  



It took a full 6 weeks of weaning myself off the Effexor.  It took another 2 to 3 weeks before my body felt back to normal (no shivers at all).



In my experience, and based on my education, I feel Effexor is a great drug for controlling generalized anxiety disorder.  In the case of depression, I can not speak to Effexor's efficacy.
