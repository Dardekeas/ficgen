 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:UNCONFIRMED\_INJURY\_REPORT\#\#  



This report is not about me.  It is about a guy I knew.  He took 5MeO 4 or 5 times a day over about 3 years.  He would completely zone out for about 20mins at a time.  Once, we was found drowned in his hot-tub after taking 5MeO while sitting in it.  He was revived, but it did not slow down his use at all.



One day, he completely lost his short-term memory.  Just like that.  `Woah!  Reality just shifted!' he said.  Thereafter, every 15mins, he forgot where he was and what he was doing.  He is the Memento Man.  After a few months, he lost his long-term memory too.  Friends became strangers.  It was like Alzheimers.



This is a warning to all.
