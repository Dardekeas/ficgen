One week ago I took my first ever dose of 2c-i.  I weighed out one gram and mixed it with 500ml of vodka so that 10mL of vodka would equal 20mg, which is the exact dose I wanted to take.  The 2c-i was completely dissolvable in the vodka, and shit method proved to be safe and accurate.  I was extra careful to take the exact dose I wanted because the dosages are relatively dose sensitive.  



At 7:00 I drank 10mL of the vodka, waited for it to kick in.  About 30 minutes later, the 2c-i kicked in full force.  The come up was a bit overwhelming, and my body did not know what to do with all the excess energy so I sat down on my bed.  I put some head phones on and covered myself with a blanket and started to feel very warm, and relaxed.  Although it felt pretty speedy, it was more of a soothing, warm speedy, similar to MDMA.  



I closed my eyes, and my closed eye vision started to be taken over completely by fractals, patterns, and random colors.  I became so lost in the music that my mind and body seemed to become separated and my thoughts had to travel a long distance to get from my mind to my body.  I relaxed on my bed with my eyes closed for at least an hour without opening them.  



I became one with my surroundings and felt like I was in the state of Nirvana.  I realized that there was something more to this life that no human could ever begin to comprehend.  No other drug has ever made me feel like 2c-i did.  Once I opened my eyes, I started to trip a little less hard, and started socializing with some of my other friends who were tripping too.  



The trip was very controllable, unlike LSD and shrooms.  It was like I could control how hard I tripped with my mind.  If I wanted to trip hard, all I had to do was concentrate, and tell my mind to reenter the state of mind it was in.  My trip lasted for a total of about six hours, but I could not sleep for nearly eight hours.  



Towards the end of my trip, at about the five hour mark, I started to get a bit uncomfortable and had a bit of nausea, but that wasn't my big problem.  I had some mucus in my throat and I had to keep spitting.  There was so much spit that I could not bear to swallow it all.  I had to spit into a cup for a few hours until it stopped, then I was finally able to go to sleep.  



Despite this little mishap, I love 2c-i.  The good thing about it is the trip is not so mentally overpowering if I don't want it to be.  I could definitely see myself functioning in public on 2c-i.  This drug is truly psychedelic and places among my favorites now.  The next day I felt amazing.  I had a bit of an afterglow throughout the next day and felt like I really learned something the night before.  I felt like a much better person overall.  I want experiment in the 25-30mg dose range but I need to find a way to resolve my mucus problem because I would think a larger dose would just make it worse.    



I have done MDMA, AMT, 5-meo-amt, 2c-t-7, 2c-b, lsd, shrooms, salvia and oral DMT and out of these 2c-i ties for second, with shrooms, which are right below LSD.  The best way I could describe 2c-i by comparing it to other drugs would be to call it a psychedelic tab, or a mellow hit of acid.  I got tons of closed eye visuals and also a good amount of opened eye visuals.  2c-I did however make me feel dizzy which most psychedelic don't do to me.  



Smoking marijuana increased the dizziness significantly, so during one smoke session, I had to stop before the bowl was done.  I could not handle another hit of the pot.  The open eye visuals were very similar to 2c-b open eye visuals, which are somewhat like LSD.  This was my first experience with 2c-i but I plan on using it again.  If you are thinking about taking 2c-i be sure to accurately weight it out.  Eyeballing could lead to a disaster.  Be safe, 



-peace and love to all-
