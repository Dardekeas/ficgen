Another foxy weekend was enjoyed. This time my significant other decided to join me to see how the new material sits with her. She with 8mg, and me with 14mg. In a nutshell\ldots  she loved it! A day of walking through the fields watching the network of winds, laying in a hammock under large oak trees, listening to music, and doing home improvements to our little lilly pad. Such a rich rich day\ldots  Each time I do it I seem to get more out of the material, it s definitely an all terrain vehicle that can be driven anywhere with a little focus. I think this foxy has taken the place of 2cb in my heart for sensuous enhancement purposes. 



My lady found it particularly suited to her taste, she is more fond of tryps but not inclined to take the standard powerhouse materials very often. It was just enough to open the folds of reality and put things into perspective for her. Sensuous and open, the high priestess in good form. She mentioned afterwards that she looks forward to making this a regular supplement in her diet.



Putting a little cannabis on top was fantastically mental for me, and it put us both in touch with the earth energies that abound in this area. Later in the evening we supplemented with GHB and found it to provide a very nice relaxation. In my explorations with foxy I have noticed that I require about a gram more GHB than my usual dosage in order to really feel it. 



I encourage you all to check this one out\ldots  the fact that it's quazi-legal is almost too good to be true. ;)
