After finally getting a chance to satisfy my curiousity with methylphenidate (ritilin) I feel the need to document it. 



Setting: Last nite, due to a lit paper, I only got 4 hours of sleep. After school I procured 5 generic ritilin tabs, and was already anxious as hell to go home and get high. Later, these were confirmed to be 10mg, methylphenidate after a google search on the markings. I also have not snorted anything and my previous drug experiences has been with just pot \& hydrocodone, not even alcohol.



Starting roughly about 5-6 o'clock pm I crushed one of the tabs with the help of a glass bottle which was housing a delightful bamboo plant, and some school stationary. I had to break apart some pieces with a pin. I snorted the 10mg, and noticed little burn, shortly after I felt some very mild effects: more alert, heart beat, and was a little jittery. Then I smoked about 1/3 of a gram of pot followed by another 20mg snorted. after about 10mins I was plenty high, and enjoying it immensely. I was spacy yet filled with energy and couldn't stop bobbing my head to the music I was listening to very loudly.



I was also a little more coherent then I am with just pot. As to be expected thoughts just flowed marvelously. However, they weren't the usual melancholic nihilistic ones, they were more optimistic and I decided I enjoyed life immensely. I also noticed a little nasal drip, but it wasn't bad, neither was the light chemical taste in my mouth. after about an hour, I could feel both drugs, winding down, but the ritilin left more abruptly and the resonating pot felt great still. So it was a smooth transistion, I went from highly energic to feeling almost completely exhausted.



But again, it still felt great, I was tempted to snort more, but I resisted. 3-4 hours later I had a subtle nausea, which when sitting, bothered me little. Today, I wanted to get high again and snort more ritilin, but thats a common pitfall I have, I am far too indulgent. caving in at about 11 o'clock I snorted 20mg, and topped it off with a hot shower in the dark. I noticed little this time, just energy and a boost in confidence. This pretty much concludes my introductory experiences with ritilin, and I hope to have more. Overall, I tend to still like opiates and pot better, but stimulants like ritilin are delightful as well.
