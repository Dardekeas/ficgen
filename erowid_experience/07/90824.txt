I've got a bit of experience with general stimulant and downers and quite a few `research chemicals'. So after the almost constant year-long publicity campaign for `benzo fury' I got some off a trusted source. I'd just come back from the royal wedding and was looking for something to do for a couple of hours. 



T=0 I bombed 100mg

T= +2.20 I feel the first real effects they're quite subtle at the start and then it has a MDAI-like body load but without the bad side effects

T= +2.40 I'm now at a +2 level (its obvious but I can still function and its not my reality etc.) The visuals are 2-CE like so intensification of colour the walls are interesting  hues etc. 

T= +3.00 I get the feeling its leveling off and its still far too relaxed, after all the hype I wanna see what it can do! So I bomb the remaining 100mg in two 50mg bombs.

T= +4.00 its becoming more of a background effect now I dont know how I could possibly have developed a tolerence so quickly but I haven't felt any real noticable effects from the other 100mg yet. 

T= +5.00 I'm just watching this film the human centipede for the last hour it's pretty fucked up but I couldn't stop laughing at it so kinda of a mellow high in that kinda way.

T= +7.00 I'm completely down and have been for way too long maybe for the last hour and a half or so.



Also I only really noticed this in retrospect but I was really relaxed and just confident but in a chilled out way, mainly because of that I would order this again. The high I got from it however wasn't anything really special and not the MD replacement as the vendors say, but finding out that vendors lie isn't anything new it's just a bit disappointing. Overall it was medium to mild and interesting I couldn't imagine taking this in a club on its own but nevertheless it's worth a try on a lazy sunday.
