So my friend and I were strapped for cash and we figure shit let's try this tussin thing.  I drank one 8 ounce bottle of Robitussin maximum strength.  I didn't expect a whole lot out of it, but within an hour after taking the shit we were already out of our minds.  The visuals were strong, but of a different character than psychedelics.  Rather than bending and morphing of shapes and colors, I experienced a different form of visuals in which the objects in view would pretty much get up and dance around the room.



We trip balls on the shit for like 8 solid hours and my friend finally comes down.  I don't, so I'm thinking what the fuck.  I wake up the next morning and my eyes were still dilated, I was speaking very quickly to everyone and acting somewhat out of it.  I still felt half in the trip.  My vision was snowy and smoking pot made me feel insane, in a very bad way.  I remained in this state for several days.  I was sure I had fried my brain.  I finally came all the way down after five or six days, but immediately after I started having massive panic attacks, which I have never had before.



Bottom line, I think DXM is bad news man.  My friend and I nicknamed Robitussin as `Zombie Juice' because I felt like it turned me into the living dead for that week after.  I have tripped balls on 5 tabs of acid, done massive amounts of shrooms 20 to 30 times (up to 7 grams of super good ones for a single trip).  Let me tell you, none of that shit ever left me fucked up like the zombie juice.  I was convinced that I had fried my brain and was going nuts.  Thanks to a few months of treatment with Zoloft and Klonopin, however, I am now feeling like myself again.  After the first week I went to a psychiatrist and I finally stopped having panic attacks after a few weeks on medication.
