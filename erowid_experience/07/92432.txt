Threshold effects of DOM



Jan 9 1964



Dosage: Dissolved 1.6 mg as HCl in H20 - pipetted out 1/8 -$>$ 1.4 mg computed down to free base 1.19 call 1.2. at currently 180 lbs -$>$ 81 Kg = .0147 mg - 14.7 Î¼g/Kg thus - assume initial at 11 Î¼g/Kg - max differentiate at 20 Î¼/Kg - and effective (useful) at 17 Î¼g/Kg = 220 M.U. ! This is too optimistic probably $\sim$ 120 better value



Times corrected to 0 hrs at 7:05 - moment of ingestion.



1:15 - am talking to AM in his office - am suddenly aware of warm flushing and tingling in genitalia - the usual hint that I am going to be sick. My mouth is very dry. I want to leave and tell AO but I cannot for several minutes.



2:05 - teeth are quite rubby - there is the feeling of heavy pressure on the ears - as if some one were squeezing my head - mouth has the taste of having smoked far too much the night before (haven't smoked since 1962 - no EtOH for 9 days). I would like to go outside and run away but I am afraid my heart wouldn't take it.



3:15 Morning is creeping along - I feel I am paying a physical price without any mentally distorted reward - I feel at this point - at a somewhat higher dose - this will be a psychotomimetic.



3:35 To greenhouse - distinct pleasure in looking at the lush salvia divinorum - the smell fits the appearance - signs of visual distortion - at a somewhat higher dose things would creep and crawl.



4:00 Still at it - considerable hyperventilation - eyes dilated 10-15\% over normal



4:25 I think I start out here - do not have any desire to eat but I do eat - and complete my lunch (chicken, banana, apple.)



7:10 eyes $\sim$20\% dilated - I am still shaky as if my body had had a vigorous drug blow - but mentally I am O.K.



one or two more awareness in afternoon ( at $\sim$8, $\sim$9 hrs) P.M. fine. next A.M. fine.
