 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# 

I had recently been taking Coricidin to trip out.  I had done it maybe 5 or 6 times, and had never done DXM without the CPM.  I had heard that the CPM contributed to the trip because it too was somewhat psychoactive.  I had pills at my house with 4mg CPM as the only active ingredient (Coricidin Cough + Cold has 4mg CPM + 30mg DXM), so I decided to try it.  I took 8 pills at 7:45 am one day, on an empty stomach.  I felt hardly any effects until about 9:30, which was mild headache, tightened muscles, and some energy.  It was very similar to taking 400mg caffeine.  The effects wore off in a few hours.  Overall, the experience wasn't worth it.  It wasn't terrifying or horrible, just boring.
