[Methoxetamine vs Ketamine]



Strong effects last for at least 4 hours and up to 6+ hours. Unfortunately, lasting anti-depressant benefits were not evident, apart from that the experience was pretty remarkable!



Fairly slow onset for me ($\sim$25 minutes) led to re-dosing as follows:



(t - 0 minutes)  20mgs insufflated

(t + 5 minutes)  30mgs insufflated

(t + 7 minutes)  50mgs sublingually

(t + 15 minutes) 50mgs sublingually



(t + 25 minutes) strong onset, laying down in bed is good

(t $>$ 40 minutes)



Definitely similar to ketamine, strong introspective spatial effects. Sense of being completely self-absorbed, in my own world which I am right at the centre of, the world is in myself. Colours are more vivid and external experiences feel internalized in an epic way. Everything takes on a sense of being `Totally Epic' - the best way to describe it. For example, I started watching Black Swan and it felt like a monumentally epic story made just for me!



Movement is springy and weird. I feel light and quick on my feet but in a drunken way. The is a lack of co-ordination but I feel `fast'. Couldn't go to sleep, took everything 3 hours before bed time but stayed awake all night. Talking slurred and  appear `off my face' although I didn't feel classically drunk, I would appear to be wondrously staring at things \& completely self-absorbed. (Trip Sitter says).



Was on a low dose of Bupropion (I didn't take my usual anti-depressant dose of 450mg that day). Apparently Methoxetamine has some DRI effects and I didn't want any interactions.
