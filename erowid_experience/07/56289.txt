I am an experienced Cannabis smoker and have also tried a few `legal' highs, such as Salvia 10x, shroom pills, etc. My Uni mates had been hitting the legal highs in their local head shop for a couple of months, and so I decided to join them one night. My parents were away, so we decided to go to mine and chill.



We all took half a 200mg pill at about eight o'clock and started listening to some tunes. Although I was nervous before I took the pill, my anxiety left me as soon as I had swallowed. We had two bottles of water ready, as my friends told me that dehydration was the only real danger.



After an hour or so, my friends started feeling the effects beginning to take hold. I couldn't feel anything, so I decided to take the other half. Then fun began!



After about half an hour, I started being really interested in my mates' conversations. It was like we could talk about anything and everything and it was cool. When a song was played, it was like it was a private poem just for me. I started feeling like I wanted to tell people all the bad things I'd ever done and ask them for their forgiveness. An extremely positive experience!



The thing that I found most unusual was that I didn't feel in anyway inebriated. Unlike Cannabis, or getting wasted on booze, the BZP didn't add a haze to the proceedings, more it took away any restraints, leaving me totally in control of myself.



One thing I will mention is the amount of tobacco we smoked! Every ten minutes or so we would go outside and smoke a rollie each, still chatting about anything and everything.



However, at about two o'clock, I made a mistake. My friends had tried similar drugs and said that a bong hit of Cannabis was like `an orgasm in your brain.' I was eager to try and so when my turn came round I inhaled deeply. It made me the highest I'd been in a long time for about twenty minutes, but then I found the experience most uncomfortable. I started seeing minor visuals, I couldn't focus on anything at all and I started to feel sick.



We all decided to go to bed, but I couldn't relax at all. My mind was racing and I started to get `the fear.' I couldn't shut my eyes, or lie down or anything. I felt like I was losing my mind, like my head was about to burst and I was going to end up on the ground fitting or something. I went downstairs to talk to a mate, who told me he suffered the same and you just have to keep telling yourself it's the drug, you're going to be ok. He had written a message on his phone before the evening began just reading `You're going to be ok.' After chatting to him for a little while (and vomiting in the toilet) I managed to get to sleep.



Next day I felt absolutely ok, just a very minor headache, that was it. 



Would I do it again? Definitely. The feelings of openness and companionship far outweigh the negatives. However, next time I'll only take 100mg and NO WEED!! That totally messed me up.



I would never do it without people who know what they are doing. If my friends hadn't of been there I don't know what I would have done.
