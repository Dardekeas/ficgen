I was bored one night and couldn't score some bud so I tried drinking four bottles of Robitussin instead. Bad idea. About an hour later I didn't notice any effects and fell asleep in bed. When I woke up in my bed my mother, a cop, and a paramedic were standing over me. I don't remember exactly what they were saying or asked but long story short they put me into the ambulance and took me to the E.R. On the way there I looked down and saw my entire body was covered in this white sheet. 



I asked the paramedic, `Where's my body?'

`Right here,' he said gesturing to my body.

`I have a body!?' I said. He said yeah. I don't know why but I was under the impression that I was in Hell. I thought I was trapped in an ambulance that was going to drive me around for eternity. I got to the hospital and puked. It tasted like cough syrup. The doctor said I OD'd and would probably suffer some memory damage and be glad I didn't have any permanent brain damage from the fever and fast heartbeat.



I'm not sure I've changed, mentally, much since the trip. I think my long term memory may have suffered just a bit and some friends found out I `OD'd on Cough Syrup' which kinda sucked. Luckily I didn't suffer a psychotic break or go insane. Seriously, though, it's not worth it.
