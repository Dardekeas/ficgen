Well My friend has ADHD Very badly and he takes Adderall every day. He offered me some and him being my friend I took it. He told me to take about 5-6 pills if I wanted to feel anything so I did as he said. I couldn't belive how I was feeling, it is almost to good to discribe with words. 



I was in school and I was smiling at everyone I saw, Talking like I had so much to say, and just feeling like I was on top of the world. I felt like I could do anything. Almost like I was prettier and more charming. 



I had dance class the last hour of the day, and we have a Traverse Rock wall in our gym. I was an ok Rock climber and I liked to do it for fun, so I decided to try it that day. I was doing so awsome! I was climbing way past all the guys and I compleated the hardest track! Everyone couldn't belive I had done that. I could express myself exactly the way I wanted to. I wasn't scared of what others thought and I was overly sweet complementing everyone and I could say what ever I wanted with no regret.  



I really enjoied my first experience. After time I felt so depressed, Sad and lonley. I didn't think that the Adderall could be causing it but I continued taking it and I eventually got to the point where I couldn't stop because I didn't want to feel that depression that coming down feeling so everytime I started to feel like that I took another pill. 



Until one night, after a rave I got so depressed and upset I couldn't stop crying! and I had nothing to be sad about. I physically could not stop! I cried all night long until my eyes were burning and my cheeks hurt. Ever since that night I havn't taken it, I'm afraid what might happen. I have to admit this drug is Amazing! it makes you feel great and look good too, while taking it I lost about 15-20 pounds. but just try it once you can get hooked really easily. And be careful it is fun sure but I know what it feels like to feel like you have nothing good left in your life and I don't think you want that.
