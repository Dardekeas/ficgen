This was my first time doing K.  My trip sitter told me to insufflate 2  lines (100mg each) quickly, then lay down.  I did that.  He put on some trance records, and I found the effects coming on within a few minutes.  I lay down and closed my eyes, hoping that I'd be prepared for my first k/k-hole experience.  The visuals began to set on, and the body high quickly switched from drunk to dissociative. I don't remember anything from that point, until I was deep into the k-hole.  



Some background information on me, I'm a computer science major, and consider myself heavily into computers and the basic underlying method of logic, reason and programming structure.  I had no idea this would affect my k-hole.



I found myself sitting on top of a processor (a large microchip), and the processor was sitting atop a river of binary code (i.e. 110011000011001010010101), just 1's and 0's that make up the computer.  Around me were thousands and thousands of wires, all very psychedelic looking, and constantly shape-changing.  I opened my eyes and tried to focus, i could not.  Everything was shattered into hundreds of pieces, outlining a sort of tunnel vision.  I tried to talk to my trip sitter, but my speech was heavily slurred.  I asked `am i dead?'  he said `no.'  So i closed my eyes again and entered my world.  I was still floating through the binary river, this time faster, and then i shot out of the tunnel.  I was now riding atop a spiral wave, going downwards, I felt like a cowboy riding a bull.  I opened my eyes again and asked my sitter `where am i?'  he said `your house.'  I really had no clue that I was in my apt, as I did not recognize anything at all.  



Some thoughts that entered my head were `how will I finish college like this?'  `my parents won't like this one bit.'  But it really didn't scare me, as I felt such a completeness and one-ness with all spiritual things around me.  It was truly beautiful.  I laid back down and just observed the world around me (with my eyes open) and I realized I was not actually in my body.  I was sort of floating over it, and I could still move my limbs, but I could not feel them moving, just watch them.  I played around with that for a while, and then went back into my k-hole (closed my eyes.)  The vision was sort of fading, so I opened up my eyes again and tried to stand up.  That was a bad idea, because I just fell back down.  My trip sitter told me to stay sitting and that I was emerging from my k-hole.  He told me the jarring into reality was kinda tough, and brought me something to throw-up in.  Nice guy.  So I did just that, threw up, and then lay back down and emerged from my k-hole.  Coming out, i felt an intense drunkness, and just lay there thinking about it all.



I had a wonderful experience, and did not fear any of it, even the parts where I thought I had died, I still liked.  It was funny, because the entire time I thought I had not taken any drug whatsoever.



I find K to be a very beautiful substance.
