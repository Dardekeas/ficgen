Me and a couple of friends heard about hyperventilating and having someone push on us with our arms crossed makes people feel great. So we tried it. I was the first to try, nothing happened. Then we tried once more and it worked so well.



When they pushing on me I thought that I wasn't gonna be able to hold my breath, but the more I thought, the more I drifted off. I stopped thinking, nothing was going through my mind. I could see people but I know this is hard to believe but I wasn't thinking anything of my vision at the time, I didn't even realize that I had vision let alone that I was a person. 



I started drifting more and then a complete black out and then I saw myself standing in the middle of a blue room. Then I started snapping out of it. I woke up and my face was numb. I was still extremely out of it so I continued to ramble about where my friends hid my face. Really, I thought they stole my face. 



After 5 seconds I woke up and had no idea what just happened, but then it started coming back to me. My friend was like `I thought you were dying dude! You were like twitching and moving your mouth like a fish and groaning' and I woke up completely refreshed ready to do it again and again.
