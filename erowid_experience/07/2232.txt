I had an experience with 5-MeO-DMT that defies everything that I have read about it at Hyperreal. I won't say where it's from, but if you want it you will find it. It's the place that has never sold a drug. Anyway, I am a 220 pound male (Skylla's just a name to hide behind), who has a high tolerance for drugs. I got 20 mg in the mail on Wednesday. It was all together in a single unit, so I eyeballed what looked like about 3 mg. I put some on top of Basil leaves and took a hit, held it in, and had a one hour trip. It was normal in intensity and duration. It had no visuals, just the WHOOM WHOOM BZZZZZZT (joy) noise and the `plant kingdom rapture'. No big deal, and I was disgusted at the fact that there were no visuals. I went to work and came home to drink a solution containing about 4 grams of ground Syrian Rue in lemon juice. It was about 8:15. At 9:45, I was sitting at my pc, when I divided what was left in half. I put the quantity on basil, lit it, held it in\ldots  I was in the fluidic light and a sort of archetypal joy that was mindless and probably what a plant feels like. The noise oscilated faster and `tighter' then RAPTURE. The feeling flowed like water or air and at points illuminated. The trip consisted of no mental activity whatsoever. At a point in time, I remembered who and where I was and moved my fingers first. I was blind but knew that it would pass. I opened my eyes and thought how uncomfortable the bed was. I was on the floor. My head was under my computer desk, the wall phone next to my desk was knocked on the floor and to my horror - I was covered in vomit. The clock said 11:30. I did not sleep all night. I got up and somehow functioned at work, went home, and still did not sleep. I would trip on cups of coffee. (I know-no coffee and beta-carbolines, but I was out of it). I slept about 3 hours last night. At 2:00 today, I felt almost normal.



I have these thoughts: 

\begin{itemize} 

\item There is an anti-cholenergic reaction from the body to 5-meo-DMT. 

\item Harmaline will not leave the body even with EXTREME diuresis (B-6, etc\ldots )

\item If one were to keep taking harmaline, a 5-meo-DMT trip could last for life - until the body dies from sleep deprivation. 

\item The Solomon Snyder model of MAOI is not completly accurate. I say this because of the trips that would occur with coffee. (See the book `Drugs and the Brain') 

\item Beta-carboline potentiation does NOT make for a trip that will end in any reasonable amount of time. I need your input on this - what happened? 

\end{itemize}



Let me add that while there were these terrible parts, it was a religious experience. The light is mine, the experience real\ldots
