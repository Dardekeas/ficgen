[Erowid Warning: The ``water extraction'' method is ineffective in separating diethyl ether from the volatile hydrocarbon liquids/gases in ``starter fluid''. Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile hydrocarbon gases: their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage.]





One day (coincidentally my birthday) I'm driving around with a couple friends and we're arguing about what we're going to do later on that night.  Well one of the guys with us suggested doing some ether. I was apprehensive at first but since this girl that I really liked at the time was all for it I decided to try it (yes I'm well aware that it's a stupid reason to try anything).  





After purchasing a bottle of starter fluid from a local convenience store we sprayed the contents into a plastic bag.  We then poured in water until the two substances seperated (ether from heptaine/water) and drained off the bottom layer.  We were left with about half a 350ml bottle of ether.  We poured a couple of splashes of the stuff onto a rag and my friend put it to his nose and started huffing.  He became very disoriented and again my apprehensiveness set in.





Eventually the rag came around to me and despite my fears I started huffing.  About 30 seconds later I started to feel light headed but at my friends' urging I kept on huffing.  Less than 10 seconds later I had what could only be described as an incredibly large head rush, huffing anymore didn't do much and it kind of hurt so I passed the rag on.





The head rush eventually subsided but I still felt light headed and disoriented.  I decided to go inside and get a drink (by the way don't try it inside: the stench takes a long time to go away).  This was extremely difficult due to the fact that it was almost impossible to have any type of coordination, making walking a task in itself.





By the time I got back outside it was my rag again and I couldn't have been happier.  The cycle repeated itself until all the ether was gone, and then about 45 minutes after we had finished I started to feel uncomfortable on the edge of sickness.





All in all I had a good time, but on later dates when using the drug the sick feeling afterwards only got worse.  Also it's extremely addictive.  I recommend trying it once but don't let it get out of hand.
