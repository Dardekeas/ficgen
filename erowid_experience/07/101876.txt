PRL-8-53 is an old nootropic (first researched in the 1970's) which disappeared and was just re-discovered. 



I found that measuring out 10mg and mixing with 10cc of water in a syringe makes administration much easier (please note that I did NOT inject myself with this strange chemical, and would not recommend doing so). 



It took about an hour for effects to come in. I took the PRL-8-53 just before I went to work on an `average day'. In total, the effects lasted around 6 hours. 



Throughout the day I found it much easier to chat with strangers and make short (nonawkward) conversation. I would say that I felt more content than normal throughout the day. I cannot say much for long-term memory, but my working memory went to complete shit. About six times throughout the day I completely lost the word I was searching for mid-sentence, then forgot what I was talking about while looking for the word. This is a common symptom with some nootropics, such as noopept. 



No hangover whatsoever. I very very very rarely get nightmares, but had a terribly depressing dream that night. I dreamt that I suddenly became depressed in my life, and my would-be successful life/career went completely down the toilet because I couldn't combat depression. It was a particularly odd and disturbing dream because I've never been seriously depressed, nor do I usually have  nightmares. I have heard of other people undergoing personal trials who have experienced incredibly surreal and intense dreams. 



I have a ton more sitting up in my shelf, but I'm going to hold off to see if there are any longitudinal studies done on this one ;)
