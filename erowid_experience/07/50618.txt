I never have heard of kava before, until about a year ago when a friend suggested it to me saying it was a small trip high. We took some from the local herb store and went to a starbucks to get water for the kava. We had just about 1/4 of a cup of water and poured half a bottle of kava in so it would lessen the burn and awful taste. I held my nose and drunk that nasty drink.



At first I did not feel anything and then about 5mins later I just went in a focused trance. Not full blown tripping but in my mind I was in a very happy calm place. So we drank more until we both did a bottle and a half. The kava high lasts only about an hour but I feel good for most of the day.



The good thing about kava is that it has natural alcohol in it. If I take about 3 bottles I can get drunk or buzzed plus the small tripping high. Kava with weed is really, really, awesome. It makes me trip harder and longer if I take a bottle or more before I smoke. I'm not sure about how well this works but one friend soaked his weed in kava and he dried it. He said he got `mondo' high. He said it works better but I personally have not tried it. Although I have tried a joint soaked in kava, it does give the weed a sweeter almost good taste instead the nasty liqiud taste. But as for the high it was different but I don't think it was greatly better.
