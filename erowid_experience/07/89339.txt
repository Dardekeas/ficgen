About a week ago a few friends and I decided to trip, we each had an eight of mushrooms and a hit of molly, about 100mg MDMA but we didnt weigh it. The trip was great. We got good quality mushrooms and molly, which was good because I didnt know the supplier of either. But all in all a pretty normal trip with friends. 

     

But what I'd really like to report is the day after. Normally after a mushroom trip I feel\ldots  off, like everything isnt quite how I remembered it the last time I was sober, and normally after taking MDMA I feel like I got hit by a truck. I woke up the morning following the trip feeling quite similar. Pushing 15 hours after we had started the night before I felt tired but I couldnt sleep, sore, thought process was slowed. Generally just not well, which I was used to. My friend noticed that I looked like a zombie and offered me some of his 5-htp, he told me it might make me feel better, and I figured, its over the counter, what could it hurt. Not long after I got a ride home, feeling quite zombified the whole way, when I got home I showered, and then ate. Which is odd for me following a night of MDMA use. Then I sat on the couch and watched tv with my family, I started to notice that I felt really good, not high just good, I was thinking on an even level. I wasnt depressed, I had the motivation to participate in trivial conversations, and after a few hours I took a long nap, woke up for a few more hours and then went to sleep.

     

The next few days I felt completely normal, maybe better than normal. Not high, just in a good mood, content. 5-htp seemed to completely counter-act the seemingly inevitable 3-day down from MDMA I became accustomed too. All in all I would highly recommend 5-htp to anyone coming down from a night of MDMA who has to work, or is just looking to avoid the down
