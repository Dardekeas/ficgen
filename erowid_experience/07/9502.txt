Here's the thing.  My junior year of high school, february of 1999 I was diagnosed with a cronic illness.  It was ulcerative colitis, a digestive disorder.  This disease has a way of putting people down for years, and can give colon cancer if left untreated.  The problem is there is no cure for it exept removal of the colon.  I went through that year and my senior year to find myself as a freshmen in college.  I was thinking about my freedom, and realized I wasnt truly free, I still needed to go to the bathroom 10 times a day or so.  



In December of 2000, I decided I met another person with colitis.  I was told that I should stay away from drugs because of the risk of health interactions.  I was curious about pot and colitis, it's supposed to be medicinal, right?  He told me that he hadn't noticed anything, but he has a different, less severe case of it.  He told me that he would love to help me further my studies, if that was what I was doing.  



A few days later I was trying pot for the first time. Of course I wanted to look at it as scientificly as possible.  I didn't notice anything in my colon, but at least it wasn't a negative effect. I started to get stoned more often, just for something to do.  I realized that I was having to use the bathroom much less, and almost never would I need to go while I was high.



I decided to further my studies I would quit smoking it, and sure enough my condition went back to its usual self.  I began smoking pot as I needed it and realized that one joint a night left my stomach and colon feeling soothed.  



If you have ulcerative colitis and are looking for a cure with pot, I can't tell you for sure, but it seems to have worked for me.
