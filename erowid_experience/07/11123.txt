As many teenagers out in the world, it all started off small. I began drinking at the age of 15. At first it was sooo great. Any problems I had were instantly flushed away and I felt on top of the world. Never in my entire life I felt anything that felt so damn good. As time went on, I began drinking like a fish. I was getting cocked at school even. I used to get drunk to the point where I would be throwing up and passing out\ldots  How ever I saw any fun out of that I still dont know to this day. Even with my mother being an alcoholic, I still kept at it. Eventually my mom saw what this was doing to her family and realized that she could potentially lose everything she worked hard for\ldots  Her house, 3 beautiful children and her husband. She got her act together but I still kept at it.  



Ive always had a thing for cars, and im 18 now. I finally got a really nice car, and was soooo proud of it. All my life my mom used 2 pay for everything I own. I got a job, and began to save up. I ended up buying a 1993 nissan altima decked out for speed. God did I love that car. And for once in my life I was proud to say I paid for it with my own money. IT WAS ALL MINE and I felt sooo proud. 



Now I always heard all the shit about `dont drink and drive' but being as stupid as I was did it anyway. I was on my way home from playing pool at a pool hall where I live. I was so fucked up I still dont remember the ride home to this day. I was about 1/4 mile from my home when hell opened up on me. I was pretty much POD'ed and had no clue what the hell was going on. Going about 50 around a bend, half passed out I hit wet leaves and my car did a 180. The back end of my sports car hit a curb sending me and my car I worked so hard for 7 ft off the ground. Now what happends next is from what im told by police and paramedics, and the kind souls that saved my life that night. My nissan struck a utility pole at 50 mph, sending my head through the drivers side window. The impact opened my trunk sending my 12 disc cd stacker flying 30 feet from the wreakage. My sun roof imidieatly flew in front of me 10 ft at the same time I was violently thrown into the passengers seat. 



Now that night my car was full but earlier I dropped everyone off and was alone. Anyone in that car would have been instantly killed because the rear passenger door was smashed and pushed halfway into the backseat. My stereo system speakers were ripped out of place and ejected. Then as quick as it all went down, I struck a rock after swinging from the utility pole. Everything was once again calm. That night I must have had an angel by me because my car was sooo fucked up, that it looked like a trash compactor was just finished with it. Here's the crazy part. I only suffered bruises, split my head a little that only required 2 STICHES!!!! And got knocked out. For some reason my life was spared that night, and I am realizing now why that was. That was my wake up call to cut the shit with binge drinking and drug use. I wasnt ready to die yet and have some purpose on this earth. Call it what you want to call it, but I call it fate. Drinking almost DID take me to a place I have never been before\ldots .that is my very own grave. Im so happy to be alive and see what life is really about now.



Im an as strieght as an arrow now and call me a pussy if you want to, but I am damn proud of it. I almost died that night and would have never have had the chance to see my friends or family EVER again. Now to all of you who follow what I used to do, think again please. You might get your wake up call too, but chances are you wont be so lucky. Im not saying stop totally, but have a sober driver at least because the guilt you will live with killing someone will be horrible and I dont think you want to live your life as a murderer. Look alive and be true to yourselves, dont walk the same path I did please! Try to get something out of all of this and realize next time what could happen. Death is a high price to pay for any of us. Peace and be smart!!
