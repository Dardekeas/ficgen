Saturday the 14th of december. a night to remember for years I got some red diamond mdma pills and decided to introduce my friend `crow' to the world of bunnies and plur. Note crow is a very goth kid usually sad and depressed. He reacted in a way totally different from any other roll. He didint bounce off the walls or anything he just curled up and felt soft things. He still had immense positive energy tho he consumed one red diamond. 



But I'm the star of this show. So onto my experience. I ate my two pills with a light dinner of half a bagel and cup of oj. it took about an hour to kick in. I was by myself at first but then some friends came over. And we danced and raved like the kandy kidz we are. It came time for a cig so we all were to step outside. 



I stayed behind for a second for I felt the strong urge to talk to my dad (we have been fighting for a long time). I'll make a long story short and say that I told him I loved him and sorry for being cranky and blah blah blah and I made him cry and I just communicated feelings I could not before with my family and am holding onto that power and vision shown to me by x. I'll spare the rest of my experience becuase its just for me. But here the bottom line:



I think MDMA can give you the extra love and courage to fix problems with yourself and loved ones. And the power to crack shells of negativity and tear down the walls of hate. I highly reccomend MDMA to be used in times ot personal reflection. And the occasional rave.

What good is a mind body and spirit if you dont have the freedom to use them as you wish in peace.
