Below is my experience with 2-methyl-2-butanol. I wrote the report as it was happening, so it reflects what I felt at the time and should be more accurate than a report written from memory.

I found out about this chemical and its possible uses because the name made me think it could be something like GHB, which I haven't tried. A quick search led me to the Wikipedia article. From there, I searched and found mentions of its use in old medical books on Google Books. Many of those use alternative names for the chemical. I saw it compared in those books to several sedatives that interested me, none of which I have tried. I was now more curious about this than ever, wondering whether it would be something nice or something awful. Thus, I decided to try out 2-methyl-2-butanol.

I tried this at a lower dose several days ago, with no negative effects other than tasting the chemical when I burped for the next 10-12 hours. It worked well as a sedative and I slept well through the night. I did seem to still be feeling it a bit the next morning for an hour or two after waking and could taste it when I burped. I took it on a full stomach this time, possibly increasing the absorption time and duration of effects.  

Now I am trying it at a higher dose. I have a mild headache at the time of dosing, which seems to be getting worse. I don't know if this will help, make it worse, or have no effect.

12:10PM - I dosed 3.36g of 2-methyl-2-butanol. The taste is a bit unpleasant, but not too bad. Kind of like peppermint with a `chemical' taste. Has a similar smell. I haven't eaten much yet.

12:15 - Starting to feel it for sure. The effects set in quickly.

12:20 - Now it is getting strong. The euphoria is more intense than with ethanol. There are similarities to the feeling, but also some big feelings. There is a nice body warmth. I would have to be a lot more intoxicated on ethanol to feel the same level of euphoria. I also feel more sedated than I would with an equivalent dose of alcohol, though my mind is also clearer. I am quite relaxed.

12:30 - Pretty much the same as 10 minutes ago, maybe a little stronger. It is nice at this level, but I want it a little stronger. I'm dosing another 2.52g. That is 3ml. I found 1ml=820mg.

12:40 - That second dose is hitting me now. The intoxication is fairly strong, but it is not like I am drunk. The euphoria and body feeling are also better now. I could probably sleep easily if I wanted to. I wish I had some experience with chloral hydrate, paraldehyde, and/or ethchlorvinyl. These are the chemicals this one has been compared to in effects in old medical text books from back when this drug was used medicinally, along with ethanol. Maybe it shares effects of some or all of these drugs. I don't know.

12:50 - Once again I have peaked. The headache is no worse. Everything is pretty much the same as it was 10 minutes ago. I can walk just fine, no motor disturbance is evident yet. My skin feels good. Touching the sheet and feeling the air on my skin is quite pleasant. I may dose a bit more in a little while. The effects last quite a while judging from last time.

1:30 - Dosed another 4ml. I was already very relaxed and serene. Lets see what this does. I don't think I will use any more this time. The feeling has things in common with ethanol and benzos. Not feeling any negative effects yet. Lets see how it is once this final dose kicks in. Either it will be a very relaxed state, or perhaps I'll end up asleep. My headache is nearly gone.

1:50 - ADDED another 1.5ml a little while ago. The level of intoxication is similar to 7 or 8 beers, which would definitely cause a hangover. If I get no hangover from this, I can definitely say the side effects are less severe than those of ethanol. The effects are still quite distinct from those of ethanol, though they seem a little closer as the dose has been increased. I'd still say it is best described as somewhere between benzos and ethanol to the best of my experience. I may end up asleep as the sedation is quite strong, Motor incoordination is less than with ethanol. Headache pretty much gone.

5:40 - I spent most of the time since the previous entry sleeping. Just got up maybe 10 minutes ago. Still feeling a nice intoxication, though not as much euphoria. I intended to be up sooner if I went to sleep. That's ok though, I had nothing else to do and didn't sleep much last night(less than an hour). I'm feeling a bit icky, and it feels pretty much exactly like the beginning of poppy withdrawal. That is probably what it is since I have waited this long for my dose. I would usually be feeling bad by now without taking my dose. That is about to be remedied. Then I'll know if it is poppy withdrawal or a side effect of this drug that is starting to make me feel bad. No headache.

8:30 - It has been slowly but steadily dropping off. I had my poppies about 45 minutes ago with 75mg diphenhydramine and 1.2g gabapentin, my usual potentiators, and everything is fine now. I am still also feeling the 2-methyl-2-butanol, but at a much lower level than before. I doubt it is effecting me any more than a beer or two, though as I have said, it is quite distinct from ethanol. It certainly mixes better with poppies. I don't like mixing opiates with ethanol as it seems to decrease the duration and the level of pleasure for me. I am sure I would be below the legal limit if it were ethanol and I didn't have opiates in my system.

9:00 - The poppies have fully kicked in by now. I feel more mellow and relaxed than I normally would from this dose, so I guess the 2-methyl-2-butanol is still affecting me. I do feel quite clear headed though. Just very relaxed and mellow. The euphoria is definitely stronger than I'd feel from the poppies and potentiators alone.

10:00 - It feels like it has pretty much worn off. At most there are some residual effects. It is feeling more like a plain poppy high right now.

11:30 - The body feeling tells me there may be a bit left in my system, but mentally it seems to have worn off. I don't seem to be getting the taste in my mouth any more. I'll say it has worn off for all practical purposes.

12:15 AM -  If there are any effects left, they are impossible to pick out from those of the poppies and potentiators, Feeling a bit tired. It is late, I'll soon go to sleep.

2:00 AM - I fall asleep around this time.


Next day:
10:15 AM - Everything feels normal to me upon waking. No impact felt from yesterday's activity.

3:30 PM - I am starting to feel quite bad. It is probably because I haven't had my dose of poppies. I'll soon see if that clears things up. I'd be surprised for a hangover to occur with hours of feeling fine in between the drug wearing off and the hangover starting. This does feel like poppy withdrawal anyway. I'll soon find out since I am about to take my next dose of poppies. 

4:50 PM - Drank poppy tea made from the hard pieces at the tops and bottoms of the pods. That and stems is all I have left, the pods were all eaten. That cured my symptoms. I better get some more pods soon, because my supply is dangerously low. Poppies are not the topic of this report though, so I won't go into that too much. I am feeling mighty fine with the dose of poppies and the usual potentiators. Poppies just make you feel so good and comfortable. I think they are underrated as a drug. Now I'll feel the pleasure the poppies provide. My dose was higher than before, so I'll be drifting away in opiated bliss. This concludes the trip report. Below are my feelings about 2m2b and a summary of effects.



It has been my experience that opiates will not cure an ethanol hangover, though they do make the symptoms less severe. Poppies completely got rid of the physical and mental discomfort I was feeling both times so that and the timing of symptoms tells me that those symptoms were from poppy withdrawal and not the 2-methyl-2-butanol.

Just a warning: The total dose was taken over several hours. That much at once could be too much, especially if you are a lot smaller than me.

Summary of effects:
Dosage: 2-10ml (more than 6-8ml will probably put you to sleep)
Amounts of 2-6ml or so for recreational use. More will probably be sedating enough that you'll want to sleep.
Duration: 8-10 hours, maybe less at lower end of dose range or more above listed dose range.
Necessary dose may be less for smaller people. I am quite overweight.

Positive effects:
Moderate euphoria - more than benzos or ethanol
Pleasant body high
Relaxation
Reduction or elimination of anxiety
Sedation
Sleep induction - Positive if this is what you are seeking, occurs at higher end of dose range
Increased sociability
Lack of negative short term side effects/hangover

Negative effects:
Somewhat bad taste, comes up when burping.
Possible lingering effects up to 12 hours after dosing, may be negative in some circumstances.
Motor incoordination at higher doses, not as bad as ethanol
Could probably be addictive
Possibility of long term negative effects that haven't been discovered


If you choose to try this chemical, start low. Many drugs are highly dependent on body weight and necessary dose can vary even among people of same weight. You may not need as much as I to achieve same effects.

I find this chemical to be better feeling than either benzos or ethanol, and the side effects less severe than those of ethanol. Side effects actually seem pretty much non existent. I use benzos mostly in combo with opiates or 1-3 servings of alcohol, which makes them more enjoyable. Ethanol is pretty much only useful to me as something to combine with sedatives such as benzos or barbiturates. The amount of ethanol needed to provide a nice euphoria is too high and leaves me feeling sick within hours. That makes it pretty useless as a recreational drug on its own.

I said the effects were something between those of ethaol and benzos. I don't mean to imply that it feels like mixing the two. That is something I've tried, and it is not the same as this. I wish there was a drug I have tried that is more similar to this one so that I might provide a better comparison. I mentioned some drugs that this one was compared to in medical books from the time when this chemical was used medicinally. One person said the description I gave sounded something like chloral hydrate. I just don't know. I haven't tried any of the chemicals that I have seen this one compared to.

I have no idea whether or not this chemical is safer or less harmful to the body than ethanol, but it sure feels like it is. There could be unknown dangers associated with it, so please be careful if you decide to try it. I can also not promise that you will find it to be as nice a substance as I have. Maybe we'll get some more people with experience with this substance so that effects and side effects can better be determined.
