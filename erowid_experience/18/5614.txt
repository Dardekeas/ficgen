First off, a little background information.  I am very active in sports teams, so my usage of drugs or alchohol is very limited.  I don't want to get caught doing something that would jeopardize my spot on the team.  I only drink occasionally and i smoke weed once in a great while. Usually only about once every 4 - 5 months.  The only other drug i've used is MDMA. (only used once)



Last night I was out with my friends and we ended up smoking weed.  We sat around for a few hours after that until another guy came over. He had opium, so we all decided to smoke it.  I'd never done it before so i was kind of excited.  I smoked 2 bowls and just kind of sat around.  After a few minutes, everythign seemed to get really quiet and calm.  My ears were really sensitive to things and it was just like in the movies.



Everything seemed to be happening all at once. I could listen to one person talk but still be listening to the people 10 feet away's conversation. We were in a garage so everything kind of echoed. That was interesting to hear. I had a really limited attention span, where i would ask someone a question and while they were explaining it i would zone out and not really hear what they were saying.



I would still appear to be listening and i would make comments but i didnt really hear them talk. I just kind of stared at them while i was focusing on something else.  It's hard to explain.  During this whole fiasco, i felt like i was watching everything happen from a small window up in the corner of the room.  I was very detached from everythign around me.  My hands and arms seemed to be tingly and i kept rubbing them.  (Maybe it was just because i was nervous)  My memory was pretty shot.  It was hard to have a converstaion. I would be talking about one thing while listening to the conversation behind me and forget what i was talking about. I was pretty happy and was hugging a lot of people.  It was really easy to act normal if you were sitting down.  While standing, i felt like i was kind of drunk in my movements.



Overall it felt like i had a high like from weed but way mellower.  The high lasted only a few hours and i was able to go home and talk to my parents 3 hours after taking it. My friends were ok to drive also.  Its hard to describe.  But today, the day after, I have had no side effects.  I'm just pretty tired but no more than what i would usually have had from weed.
