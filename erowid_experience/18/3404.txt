Continuing my experimentation with household spices, I took an oral dose of 6 nuts, grated into slivers with a normal knife (same method of preparation as my nutmeg-smoking venture) and took it orally by the method of taking `shots' of it, followed by long gulps of various liquids (I tried milk, orange juice, and water -- all of them were fairly satisfactory). The problem was `backlog' of small slivers of nutmeg getting into the liquid I was washing it down with -- which made it fairly disgusting, but much better in the whole than any other method of ingestion I had taken. 



I settled down to watching some television (a Nature Channel programme about sharks, and then one about lions) -- when the lions chased an animal 

or made a kill, or slept in the shade, or anything else, I felt as if I was *PART* of the scene. I then retired to bed. When I closed my eyes, I had fairly vivid, although non-concrete, closed eyed visuals, which would persist for some time after I opened my eyes. 



Sometime during this venture, I fell asleep, and had very vivid dreams. Waking up, I felt very disoriented, and walked like I was very, very drunk. I sat down, and felt a wave of sexual excitement come over me. I masturbated, along with a mental fantasy which was lived out in my body (I felt tactile sensations in other parts of my body). I intend to try intercourse on nutmeg, with my partner also under the influence (consensually, of course!) sometime soon. Nutmeg, apparently, can be strong sexual enhancer. Notify Pfizer at once!
