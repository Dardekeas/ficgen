I'm not exactly what people call a `druggie' (actually, they call me that, but that's because I wear tie-dye ;) ), but I've had 2 completely different experiances with nutmeg, both pretty good\ldots ..



First time I tried nutmeg (as a `I want to see if this crap really works' experiment), I used maybe 1 tbs. This was at maybe 11 pm. After about an hour, I got a little lightheaded, and went outside and lay down on the grass.  I felt calm and sort of.. I want to say, `at one with nature'.  Yeah\ldots  then I went to bed\ldots  had some odd dreams, and then woke up at 5:30 am and listened to Simon \& Garfunkel for a while.  I felt.. drawn into the songs somehow\ldots  when I closed my eyes, I could almost see the words and stuff in the songs\ldots .. I was pretty mellow the whole day\ldots  I mean, I'm usually pretty calm.. but\ldots  I felt like I couldn't be angry or upset, like it would've been impossible.



The second time I tried nutmeg was with some friends\ldots  took about 3 tbs this time, at about 4 pm.  After an hour or 2, I started to see little colored spots and lines (you know when you close your eyes really tight and you see spots? like that\ldots ).  This lasted maybe an hour\ldots  then I went for a walk in the woods. I tried to read, but the page was covered in blue and pink squiggles, so I just sat and looked up at the trees. This was cool, b/c the trees were all in weird focus (like, instead of seeing a bunch of brances in front of the sky, it looked like some little bits of sky in front of some branches).  I felt all calm and `at one' again, though I stopped seeing things\ldots 



Between 9-10 pm, I started seeing things again\ldots  but this time\ldots  woah.. I mean, I wasn't seeing my lamp turn into a fairy or any of that sort of shit that I hear from people who've tried acid\ldots  but I started seeing more complicated things then before.  My personal favorite was a big, orange, spinning flower that changed size (I went around telling people about this ;) )\ldots .  I felt all heavy and slow, like what I imagine trying to move in quicksand or glue would be like\ldots  almost like I couldn't move.  after about 11 pm I went back to feeling almost normal\ldots .



The hallucinations were pretty vague (none seemed really solid)\ldots  but.. it was really neat\ldots . And I didn't get any of the side effects people on here talk about, `cept that I was really fucking tired the next 2 days\ldots 



Nutmeg's something I'd recommend trying at least once, (the shitty taste doesn't exactly make you want to use it a lot, but it's worth it..)\ldots .
