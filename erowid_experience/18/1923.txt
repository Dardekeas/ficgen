My roommate was doing GHB quite frequently for a while, but never got very good at doing it.



On more then one occasion, he would take way more then he should. Off of the G he was getting, 15 ml was enough to catch a buzz but not pass out. One of these times I could see he was starting to pass out on the couch\ldots nothing new\ldots  but then he stood up, and fell over, landing rather painfully.



I was trying to help him get to his room, but he wasn't hearing what I was saying. He would keep tying to fight off the effects (or at least the sleep coming on), and his limbs would periodically give out. He would basically crumple to the floor time to time. The best way to describe it is a zombie that keeps passing out. 



When I was helping him to his room, only getting grunts and groans out of him, he stood up, then his lower back gave out, so he did a face plant into a counter in the kitchen were walking through and broke his nose.



Taking him to hospital was one of the crappiest things I had to do.



Watching these performances has given me a huge respect for proper doeses with this drug.
