I prepared 2.5 - 3 feet of a hardy, thick, dark green stalk of San Pedro which grows at a neighbor's house by blending, staining through a t-shirt, boiling, straining, boiling\ldotsetc until I obtained about 4 cups of clarified green liquid (it was also strained through coffee filters\ldotsvery tedious)  I froze it for several weeks.  Being the chemistry enthusiast that I am, I decided to try a chemical extraction.  I thawed the liquid, made it basic with NaOH, and extracted 3 times with DCM (dichloromethane), pooled the DCM, and evaporated it with acetic acid in order to form the acetate salt of mescaline (and the other alkaloids).  I obtained a crystalline mass which may only be described as piercingly bitter.  YES!  I dissolved this in 10mL of Vodka, and it, too, sat for two weeks before I looked at it again.  



Two friends and I decided to consume the cactus one fine Saturday.  More was crudely prepared for the third member of the group as a liquid extract.  Myself and N split the alkaloid extract, while P drank the sludge.  Afterwards, I took a large gulp of the sludge, too.  We waited about an hour at my house where we played billiards and felt light and giddy.  



We drove to a local park where there are hiking trails, beautiful and green this time of year.  When we arrived, we all felt pretty intoxicated, but very relaxed. (this was about 1.5 hours after consumption.)  We hiked up the very steep trail for about 45 minutes until reaching our first stop; a secluded grove which, at the time, looked like a painting, an image of purest nature and greenery.  I told my friends we should split up to meditate for a while\ldotsThey stayed together, I stayed in the grove.  The visuals were strong, and were most exhilarating.  The path wound through the trees like a serpent, and the lush greenery was bathed in divine light.  I was perched upon a rock which had a plaque, in memory of a hiker who had died.  It read: ``Life holds no promises; Cherish today.''  This affected me deeply.  



I caught up to my buds, who sat grinning halfway up a grassy hillside.  We climbed to the ridge, where we again separated after talking for a while, and sat in silence.  The visuals grew richer.  I knew then that I was seeing the world through God's eyes.  I felt enlightened, in touch, at peace with nature.  I saw a landscape (eyes closed) with mountains, and I saw time like a curtain draped around the peaks.  Light and truth slid around time like a snake in the sand.  I was overwhelmed with the visuals and the intense emotions which accompanied them.  



I did not want to leave, but of course, we did.  Society and civilization contrasted sharply with all of the truths I experienced on that hill.  Power lines criss-crossed the country road that led to the trail, it was dark, and there was traffic; danger and uncertainty, pollution and police were the truths of the city.  It was about T + 6 hours when we were coming back, and the drugs were still in effect, still revealing truths all around me.  



Fortunately, I came home to an empty house with my friends, and my girlfriend proceeded to call, and several other friends came over with her.  (Oh yeah, this is why people live in this place.)  We all sat on the floor in the living room, digesting the day, making music on an electric keyboard, laughing, talking\ldotsSociety, I found, has its perks.  Later, we went to a private party for a youth soccer team at the local winery (my friend's dad is the winemaker) and we played in the bottling room, and in the vineyard.  There was food, drink, warmth, people, friends, and good music.  Somehow, I managed to take a remarkably powerful, highly religious psychedelic experience, and blend with it the joys of society and of the natural world.  I cannot imagine a more perfect day.  I will also never forget this method of preparation which, by far gave me the best results to date with Trichocereus cactus.  



``El Amor Divino sopla el aliento de la vida por los corazones de hombres.''
