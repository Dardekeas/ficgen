I have used meth on various occasions over the past six months.  For me, it sharpens the mind and sustains the body when nothing else will do.  I rarely use it in a recreational sense, reserving it for paper deadlines and chronic exhaustion.  I had long wondered if positive cognitive effects could also be gleaned from cocaine.  



Recently, I received an offer I couldn't refuse.  Days went by before I had the opportunity to actually try the cocaine I longed to sample.  I prefer to err on the side of caution, fulfilling all necessary tasks and obligations before dabbling with any substance.  Currently, I take no medications or supplements outside of oral birth control.    



By the time I reached my friend's apartment, spirits were high.  It was 10:45 when she broke out the mirror and razor blade.  After producing a few lines, she did a gummer and invited me to do the same.  Within 10 seconds, my lower jaw was numb and my tongue felt clumsy inside my mouth.    



At 11:00, I insufflated a line of coke measuring approximately 1.25 inches in length.  I was struck by its odor, so different from that of meth or even pharmaceutical amphetamines.  My nasal passages felt as though they were crammed with cotton, a most unwelcome sensation.  



By 11:10, I felt an odd, disjointed energy creep through me.  It lacked the positive push and directed ambition that I typically experience with meth.  I became more talkative and memories rose into consciousness.  I felt stronger, sharper and more alert than before.  



When the feeling subsided at midnight, I thanked my friend and bid her goodnight.  I walked briskly to my car and headed back to my apartment.  En route, I felt more edgy and impatient than usual.  I am normally a mellow, patient individual and found this frightening.  The rising hostility toward drunken pedestrians was more `primal' than anything I experienced with meth.      



At 12:20, I retreated to my room.  I had no desire to speak with my roommate, as much as I enjoy her company.  I normally chat for a bit, grab a beer and play with the pets before retiring, yet found myself too irritated to do any of this.  It was a nonspecific, infantile aggravation that disturbed me.



I entertained myself with Instant Messenger for a bit before heading to bed.  My body was exhausted, but my mind was still reeling.  At the same time, my body felt `tight', as though I were in attack mode.  At around 1:30, I finally fell asleep.    



At 8:00 the next morning, I was loath to wake up for class.  My head felt heavy, as though I had a cold.  My jaw was still tense and sore, as were most of my muscles.  My head continued to pound with a raging tension headache throughout the day.  



At 2:00, I was still a nasty little ball of tension.  Little annoyances and inconsiderate strangers were greatly magnified in significance.  I entertained aggressive notions in my head, and imagined myself perpetrating them against the offenders.   



I felt psychologically shell-shocked and physically exhausted.  Yet I learned several things from this experience:  1.  For me, coke is not a cognitive enhancer.  2.  Cocaine `hangovers' are unpleasant. 



In simple terms, cocaine is averse to my station in life.  I find that it is prohibitively expensive and inefficient in comparison to meth.  I have no desire to experiment with it further.
