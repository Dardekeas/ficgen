I am a 26yo male, 190lbs, 6' tall.



4:20pm 40mg oral AMT



4:50pm Definate alerts.  Something is starting to happen.



5:15pm body temp rise, some light sweating, muscle tension, some LSD-like sensations (nose, back of throat, scalp all feel exactly like they do when I'm on LSD), 



5:30pm body temp increase and sweating slightly more pronounced, LSD-like feelings more pronounced, some fairly subtle waves of `body-high' colors already seem more pronounced.



6:10pm I've been having trouble with my contacts for some time, but ever since about 5pm or so, I haven't really been able to see very well. Everything is blurry, like my contacts aren't fittling well or are dried out. Eye drops don't seem to help.  Anyways, definate LSD-like body high. Everything is pleasurable so far.  Nose is cold, rest of body temp is up. Some muscle tension and restlessness.  Still lightly sweating.  Scalp feels `tight' like when on LSD.  No nausea yet to speak of.  



9:27pm Never had any nausea.  There was a fantastic body high that last several hours, but seems to have mostly dissipated.  It was very much like an LSD peak on 4-6 hits.  Felt very silly and energetic from about 630pm til about 845pm.  Music and other sounds were at times very disorienting and chaotic (again, like an LSD peak).  Now I feel mainly `tweaky' quite a bit of muscle tension, hard to get comfortable, restless.  Eyesight seems to have cleared up mostly.  I am definately high, but it's really hard to put a finger on just exactly how I know that I'm high.  The usual symptoms aren't there.



10:40pm Muscle tension and restlessness seems to have started to die down. Am always thirsty, and body temp is still a little high.  I feel more sensitive to changes in temp in general.  I've been slightly hungry for the past 3-4 hours, but can't seem to bring myself to eat anything substantial (nothing seems appetizing).  Some grapes, a tortilla chip here and there is really all I can manage.  The LSD-like body high seems be coming back.  Music seems to have a bit of a `speacial' quality to it, but dancing isn't really doing much for me (which is odd, cuz I like to dance A LOT).



2:00am There are some waves of body high, but not very strong.  The residual muscle tension has leapt to my head (jaws, scalp, etc) with a vengeance, and is now a full-blown headache.  This isn't really that fun anymore.  It's bearable, and I'm awake, but there's nothing really going on anymore.



7:00am Finally able to lie down and attempt sleep.  Headache still there.



1:00pm After 5 hours of sleep, I feel like I have a hangover.  That darn headache is still pounding away.  Still haven't eaten anything and not really hungry.



6:00pm Should I make some food to go to sleep? Sleep.  



9:00am Wow, I slept for a long time.  At least I can finally eat something. And that blasted headache is finally gone.  whew.
