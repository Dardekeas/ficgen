I recently tried making a yohimbe tea with some ground bark I bought at a local food and herb store. I was with a `friend' who helped me drink a little bit of the tea. The stuff tasted really bad. It took about 30 minutes to kick in. I felt like I had just drank four shots of espresso or taken a few ephedrine pills. I was very hyperactive and bouncing around the room. I also felt a little light headed. Then, the `viagra' effects of the yohimbe took effect. 



I had a very, very hard erection that my friend commented on several times. I do not know if it was from the yohimbe, but I got really into the sex. Touching was more erotic than usual. After a while, the pressure behind my imminent orgasm was very intense. The orgasm was strong, but not as strong as I was thinking it would be. After the sex, I started feeling lightheaded and kind of sick to my stomach. The effects after this point were all negative. I felt like I had a coffee or ephedrine overdose, which was very unpleasant. I had to lay down for a while. Later in the evening, when I was wanted to go to sleep, I couldn't and just layed in my bed still feeling a little gross. 



I would try yohimbe again at a lower dosage, but I wonder if I would still get the same `viagra' and sex enhancing effects.
