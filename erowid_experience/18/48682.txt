Well, I have huffed before many of times and this was the start of the crazy events. I was in the room with my cousin who was playing the guitar when I told him I would be back in 5 minutes and that I was gonna `Hit the gas can.' I went outside to the carport and started huffing in the deepest breaths possible. I have passed out many times before so I walked to the grass and sat down. Didn't really but I thought I did. 



I woke up about twenty minutes later with my head bleeding, my eyes bleeding, lips bleeding from my teeth going through them, my nose bleeding and a big ass cut on my chin. That's not all folks\ldots I went inside to my cousin and started freaking out and pulling my hair out in chunks\ldots lol. But then my cousin said smile, I did and he started laughing really hard. 



I chipped about 3/4 of my tooth off. I started laughing really hard and thought about what I should tell my grandma, who was sleeping in a rocking chair in the living room. I started brushing my teeth (didn't hurt at all, nothing did) to get the smell off my breath and then went outside and pulled the handlebars off my razor scooter. Then I woke her up and told her that I was going to her car to get a CD out of it to listen to while I go to bed and I was on the scooter and it slipped when I was getting off it. 



I stayed out of school for about a week to get rid of the black eyes and bruising on my face. I am still `Hitting the gas' can to this day. I am hardheaded and on my way to Alcoholism because I have a lot of experiences in this category too.
