This stuff does taste pretty nasty, like really, really strong ginger mixed with pepper. It stings a little and is hard to keep in the mouth for a while. I chewed about 2,3 or 4 roots (1-3 inch roots) in a few classes at school. B/c of the pungent smell, especially when chewing, people all around me were wondering what the fuck smelled so bad. I'm used to people thinking I smelled bad so I thought it was kinda funny. I wish I knew I didn't have to swallow it but I did spit some of it out after chewing for about 5 minutes per piece of root. 



Now b/c I knew it was stimulant I ate it b4 gym class. This was a great idea. I have slight asthma and allergies and this root seemed to make my breathing real clear. Also at this time I was tired and depressed and it definetely changed that. I started to socialize w/ people (unusual for me around strangers or classmates) and my balance was really good. I was standing on one foot for a long time, and I was really good at volleyball that day. But to my dismay last period (approx. 2-3 hrs after ingesting) I felt the worst nausea I had ever felt, I desparately needed to puke but didn't hoping I could make it the 10 min. Till the end of class. School ended and I ran onto the green and smoked a joint of wild dagga hoping it would ease the nausea. It was the wierdest shade of yellow liquid I ever saw. So I decided to get something to eat b/c I had ate nothing all day and my stomach was completely empty. The food cured the nausea for a second but then I puked it all up. 



Overall, calamus is worth it. My energy was increased and it was a nice feeling. I'll definetely try it again, but I'll have some food in my stomach and won't swallow too much of the root.
