I started taking DXM about a month ago and have been using it off and on since then.  On average I have been using it 3 times a week, moderate doses ranging from 200-300.  Although at times I extend the dose.  I am also on Lexapro 10mg.  I take it daily.  So the first few times I did DXM, I took high doses, and ended up having some major panic attacks, of which aren't very fun.  I stopped the DXM for a week, and still had Panic attacks waking up in the mornings.  So I went to the doctor.  He ran some blood work and told me that I had a Hypothyroid.  Now I am not sure this has anything to do with the DXM, I did not tell him I had been taking it.  I am now taking hormones to balance out my hypothyroid.



Anyhow I am still taking the DXM, along with the lexapro.  My trips are fun and seem to last longer than others trips.  I assume of course that it is because of the Lexapro.  BTW Lexapro is an SSRI.  Sometimes, I wake up at night, with a feeling of uncontrollable confusion and shivering.  I guess that could be seratonin syndrome.  They aren't as harsh and painful as panic attacks.  I wake up feeling that way, and try and walk it off and it seems to go away after a few minutes.  This only happens after I have been sleeping for a while.
