Well this just happened to me recently. I must first say I used to do meth quite frequently but due to location changes and lack of resources I had not done any for a long period of time. I had been smoking marijuana daily and been using oxycontin 80mg from time to time. I have used many drugs but have retired from most due to the fact that I developed bi-polar disorder with schizoid tendancies and they tend to make me even worse. I knew from the start it was not a good idea to be fucking with meth when it could damn well throw me into a full psychotic episode. 



Well now you know a little about my situation. So going on, as luck would have it somebody I met recently hooked me up with a gram of shards. I was excited and had accepted what might come later as part of the experience. What the hell was I thinking. The first night there were no delusions or psychotic episodes to speak of so I decided to go a little heavier on my dosage. So to make a long story short the gram lasted maybe three days. On the last day it happened\ldots  I started to see clear outlines of people everywhere. I went kinda like predator when he goes invisible in the movie. I knew this was a bad sign. Things started to get real wierd. Liquid smoke was filling my whole field of vision and I remember the outlined people getting more vivid. They would smile at me with these evil faces and wave and shit. It was scary as hell. I would be having a conversation with somebody and realise I was totally alone. Lots of times I would find myself chasing imaginary intruders out of my yard. I would see people plain as day and then when I got up close they would be a chair or lawn ornament. A lot more things happened I can't even explain like hands touching me all over. 



It all went away with time but it was a very traumatic experience. It felt like a intense dramamine trip that wouldn't go away. I am posting this report to warn anybody who suffers from mental illness be careful what they put in your body.
