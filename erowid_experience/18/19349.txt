I would like to share my experience, the time I got my back teeth pulled at the dentist. Previous to this, I probably have inhaled nitrous about 15 times, mostly in whippet form. 



I arrive at the dentist. It is pretty busy, after waiting about 25 minutes they put me in the dental surgery room. They put the mask on, which they call the `snoopy nose', because the dentist's office is mainly for kids. 



I inhale the sweet gas at a normal breathing rate. I sit patiently, nervous about having my teeth yanked out. I start to get staticy vision, and a buzzing sound vibrated in my head. Then, the wood grain wall started bending and swirling around in a spiral. I am enjoying this, my body is comfortably numb. I feel like me and the chair are starting to get sucked into the spiraling wood.



My consciousness started to become dissociated, I guess around 10 minutes. I wasn't thinking clearly, and I began to wonder where I was. I looked up at the ceiling. In the room there are shapes hanging from the ceiling, circles, squares and triangles. I looked at these and thought I was in math class for some reason. 



Then came the dentist. He injected my gums with novocaine. I didn't really know what was going on. I started biting my lip. The assistant dentist said `hey, quit putting holes in your lip.' I didn't know, but blood was running down my chin and they were putting cloth on it.



Then, I have an out of body hallucination. The dentist has a crazy smile, like on Batman the movie when people had those smiles like the joker. I was watching from about 5 feet away as the dentist started to spin my chair around really fast. The assistants also had the smile. 



I screamed `I'M IN HELL!' spitting out the gauze, blood spilling out of my mouth. The teeth were pulled, and I didn't realize it happened. An assistant ran over. `Are you ok??' I heard them say `We need to give him oxygen now'. 



I slowly started to come out of the weird daze. They helped me to the waiting room and told me to wait at least a half hour before driving. I sat there, still buzzing. My mouth and lips were so sore, I was holding gauze to my face. It was also in my mouth. I was still bleeding, but they gave me plenty of cloth. I drove home after I felt sober, and got home and took some B vitamins.



This is a really unexpected result of nitrous, I think. I never had this kind of trip on whippets. This was a bad trip, but some of it was fun and interesting.
