I had been on Lithium for two years for treatment of bipolar disorder/drug addiction.  About one year ago, I got off all of my pharms and was drug free for a year with the exception of a few drinks here and there.  



I spent a long time lifting alot of weights, doing alot of college classes, and working part time.  My life was in balance.  I had a regular diet, could run fast, far, lift alot, was getting stratight A's in college, and I was drug free.  At one point, while lifting weights, I came to realize that when I was in high school, all of my `friends' were druggie losers and how would it be fair to them if I became such a success.  



I started hearing voices in my head.  People that I went to high school with talking to each other `Did he really get sober?', `Why does he deserve to be so tough', `I thought we all knew that he snorts amphetamines', `Oh, that guy snorts amphetamines, that's why he is so tough.' It was driving me crazy, I know I am sober, I don't know what the hell these people in my head are thinking.  They must be insane.  I'll keep lifting and doing my work, soon, someday I'll be a success.



The voices never stopped, they just got to a point where they were affecting me and indirectly affecting everyone else.  All I wanted to do was crush the people in my head.  See their teeth get broken and their faces look like a bloody asshole.  I decided that in my shape, I would absolutely kill somebody.  I decided that this was not safe and went to see my doctor.



My doctor said try Abilify.  He said he knew I didn't like to be on medicine so he wrote me a script for 5 mg.  I filled it last night and took one pill at 8 p.m.  At about 9 p.m. I start to feel the affects.  My thinking is alot more linear, but somehow dampened.  I don't like it.  I take a shower and jack off.  Wow, that felt good.  



I decide to go to sleep.  As soon as I lay down and try to get some sleep, I start getting heart palpaltations.  I can see my thoughts.  The shadows in my room look like satan as well as the shadows outside of my window.  I look over at the picture my mother has of my hanging on my wall.  It looks like the face of a demon in the dark.  I immediately go up and tell my parents that the medication is having a really bad effect.  My mother gave me 2 ativans (Lorazepam) and I went back to sleep.



I kind of like the voices in my head better than this psycho medication.  I don't like drugs and more importantly, I don't like pharmeceuticals.  I am going to, once again, live drug free.
