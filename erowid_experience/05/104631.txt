I wanted to write a description of taking 5-MAPB while sexy hanging out all day with a female partner who was taking MDPV. 

We started out the afternoon with my female partner taking 6 mg of MDPV and having an enjoyable time. We were kissing and heading towards getting more sexy. After a couple hours, she redosed with 8mg MDPV and I took 20mg of 5-MAPB. I didn't want the long physical stimulation I associate with MDPV and have also experienced reduced erectile capacity with MDPV and that seemed like something to avoid. I also took 12.5mg ephedrine with my second dose of 5-MAPB, since I was clearly less physically stimulated than she was.

Overall, me on 5-MAPB and her on MDPV worked pretty well. Slightly different flavors of emotional and physical effects, but they went together pretty well.

I will gloss over most of the details of sex, except to say that it was a fun! We were mild to moderately high and sweatier and blurrier than normal. The sex lasted much longer than normal but also included frequent breaks to get up and get a drink, chat, then dive back in to the hot and heavy intimacy. 

It was that stimulant-sex mix of deeply involved sexual physical and spiritual eroticism, plus intermixed chatting and non-sexual goofing around. Sex, discussions of clothing, body shapes, online porn, books, other people, social norms, etc. Really any topic at all. But 2-30 minute interruptions and detours did not ruin the mood because the duration of the experience was so much longer and it was easier to drop back into feeling sexy than when sober.

We redosed maybe four or five times over the course of twelve hours: me taking 20mg 5-MAPB and her taking 5-10mg of MDPV every 2 hours or so. My experience with 5-MAPB had previously been that it was not as physically stimulating. My experience with MDPV is that it has a very long stimulating tail end. The MDPV `peak' wears off, but I feel a strong buzzing in my muscles and brain for 4-8 hours after the last dose. On the plus side, it gives time to clean up the house and do the laundry after spending time high, on the down side, it can leave me feeling too tired and crusty the next day.

The reason for telling this story is that around 1am, after the 10-12 hours of being high together, I was tired out while she was still ready to keep going. We took showers, cleaned up a little, had a tiny snack. Then I crashed hard and fell asleep next to her as she surfed the web on her laptop and watched a movie. I slept hard for six hours.

When I awoke, I found my partner still sitting in bed next to me with her laptop, with a big smile on her face, and watching another movie. She had not taken another dose of MDPV nor any other stimulant (no caffeine, etc). She had actually taken .5mg of alprazolam to help her chill out along with a shot of Scotch.  When I awoke, she was in a bouncy, upbeat mood and had lot to tell me about all the weird news and websites she'd found in the six hours while I was unconscious. For her, the time flew by and she had a great time. She had sort of been waiting for me to wake up so we could chat more. I was a little concerned, since it seemed like she should have gotten some sleep. Happily, we had planned a recovery day and we had no obligations at all for 24 hours.

I got up and made some food, got her another .25mg alprazolam, and did some cleaning while she chatted with me. We eventually both fell back asleep for a few hours before getting up and watching movies, having some food, and doing little before getting a full night's sleep. 

For me, this experience helped highlight the strong difference in physical stimulating properties between MDPV and 5-MAPB. Although we'd slept the same, eaten the same, and had done essentially the same physical activity during the Sexy Fun Day, I slept almost a full night's sleep after taking 5 doses of 5-MAPB (20mg each), while she was still mentally bouncy, stimulated, and grinning like she was still moderately high.

We had a great time and I'd love to do it again, but probably would either switch her over to 5-MAPB half way through or take some MDPV in order to match up our schedules. It was interesting, but a little disconnecting to be at such different levels of physical stimulation. Or, maybe do it again just like last time! It wasn't bad, just very unexpected.
