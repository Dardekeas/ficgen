Be careful as always with these new RC's. I recently bought 5-MAPB from a very top notch trusted vendor. First experience was great, very much like M1. I took 140mg or a bit more; I only remember coming to the peak then coming down. Anywho, foolishly I decided I should do it again the next day. :) In my `infinite wisdom' I thought to myself, `maybe if I take some passion flower I can have a better experience.'

I took 450mg of Passion Flower (thank god it wasn't extract) 1 hour prior to taking 175mg 5-MAPB then another dose of 90mg of 5-MAPB 45 minutes later. I can't recall much of what happened through the night but my arms and legs were convulsing heavily, I was drenched in sweat, my hands and feet were contorted, could barely move my mouth to talk because of insane bruxism and my neck tremoring. Me thinks the beginning of serotonin syndrome.

I almost went to the ER but thankfully I had pharm quality etizolam on hand. Drank a massive glass of white grapefruit juice and 4 mg of the etizolam. It's been 5 days and I'm getting brain zaps left and right. They were the most intense last night to the point that if I held still they would slowly build up into cascading fashion where if I didn't move or `shake my self out of it' I felt like I was going to seize. The brain zaps also include the feeling of an electrical charge firing throughout my arms to the tips of my fingers.

Today is better though, and I am on regimen of over a dozen vitamins and supplements along with exercise. Also abstaining from any drug. In conclusion just be safe and careful. Never Mix this with a MAOI. Take care :)
