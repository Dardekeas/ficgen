[Erowid Note: Note that some material sold as 6-MAPB in 2014 was actually 5-MAPB.] 

Since I've enjoyed all the other benzofurans that I've tried so far (5-apb, 6-apb, 5-apdb, 5-mapb at the time of this experience, 6-apdb a few months after). I bought a small sample of 6-MAPB when I first saw it available. Before proceeding I would like to add that I was not on any kind of medication during the experience. This is a report of my first trial with this substance.

Regarding set \& setting - it was morning, I was in my apartment and had nothing in particular on my mind except curiosity about this new substance. Other than the usual allergy testing a few days before and having some benzos on hand just in case I made no special preparations.

t+0 I measured out 25mg 6-MAPB with my mg scale and snorted it. The powder looked the same as 5-MAPB (aka white powder). It had the typical benzofuran taste, similar and yet different than the others. Snorting it was a bit more painful than 5-MAPB, but not by much. The pain only lasted for a minute or two.

t+30 min I started feeling the effects almost immediately and by now was at or near the peak. My desire to communicate has increased, appetite is reduced, no trippynes (wasn't expecting it), pupils are slightly larger than normal and petting my cat feels nicer. As far as side effects go there were no noticeable ones. So far this is very similar to 5-MAPB except more stimulating.

t+45 min Not much has changed since before, I guess this is the peak. I tried listening to some music and it did sound better. Perhaps a small change in the perception of time. Noticed more sweating than usual, but no other side effects.

t+50 min Cat went to sleep so no more petting, I decided to make and eat some breakfast. Will probably take a bit more after.

t+80 min Breakfast took more time than I thought it would. I got distracted by writing a few posts on various message boards. Measured and snorted 32mg more 6-MAPB (was aiming for 25mg, but took a bit too much out of the bag and couldn't be bothered to return it).

t+140 min I'm a bit higher now, attention span is shorter, pupils a bit wider than before (still normal enough to pass for sober). Noticed a bit of vasoconstriction, but not enough to bother me. Oh and my cat woke up so more petting! Yay!

t+165 min This may be a bit trippy, noticed some slight trails when playing with my cat. I would guess it is about as trippy as 5-MAPB aka not all that much in sane doses. Thinking about taking 25mg more.

t+170 min Decided to save the remaining 6-MAPB for a better time. 

t+285 min It's still going nicely, perhaps a slight drop, but still near the peak. Time perception is still off, didn't notice anymore visuals, pupils same as before (aka slightly bigger than normal). Time to cook \& eat lunch.

t+390 min Made \& ate lunch and went for a walk since the last update. The effects are fading, however my pupils are actually bigger than before (still kinda normal).

t+480 min Completely down now, pupils normal. Feeling no after effects.

In the following days I felt completely normal with no signs of any kind of comedown (this is typical for me + benzofurans).

Overall I would say 6-MAPB is very similar to 5-MAPB (much more similar than 5-apb is to 6-apb). It is a bit more stimulating and more painful to snort, but this is about it. Perhaps the difference is bigger with larger doses. I would assume that 5 and 6-MAPB compliment each other nicely, same as 5 and 6-APB do, but that the effect is not as noticeable.
