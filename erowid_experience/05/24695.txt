I planned to experiment with this chemical at a high dose after trying 2.5mg 1 week prior and experiencing very little effect. I chose a dosage of 15mg because I had a friend that had taken that amount over the course of 12 hours with no dangerously toxic effects.



     I was at my house, by myself, for the majority of this trip, and had gotten a good nights sleep the night before. I was in a pleasant and anticipatory mood leading up to the dosing.



12:54pm - Fasted for the last 13 hours. Ingested 15mg 5MEO-AMT powder dissolved in 1.5 ml distilled water which I mixed with cranberry juice.



1:36pm - Nausea. Distinct body change. Noticeable in back muscles and jaw. Increased sensitivity to contrasts of light and dark. I feel a need to excrete or vomit, though I don't really want to.



1:45pm - Body chills. Very sensitive to temperature.



2:01pm - Quiet sounds are much louder to me.



3:47pm - Watched a movie. Had a bout of diarrhea earlier. Colors. Walls not bleeding, but crawling images on my mind. Vomiting would probably feel good, but I don't like to vomit.



Definite mildly euphoric head change is evident. Communication is fun. I began thinking about things that have been on my mind recently and feeling very pleasant.



?? - I just felt exceedingly like a personification of death.



?? - Wow. It's overpowering at some moments, but I can still function. I've had two phone conversations that went well. One was fun. One was scary; I had to run for it.



?? - Wow. This is some strong shit. Yoyo baton wand oscillations of sound that moved on controllable tracks. [describing an aural hallucination]



6pm - Wow. I have never had something so in control and out of control simultaneously. I feel precise. Moving and stretching isolated muscles feels good. There is a heightened awareness of my body.



	sidenote: If I were to ingest much more than this I would probably need a babysitter to regulate fluid intake. I have been very thirsty because of the diarrhea. I feel stripped.



	I have  a very shaky grasp on communicating with others. I wonder how I sound. Conversations I'm having in my head are going on on paper at the same time and I am getting confused.



7pm - I've misplaced one glass of water already. The trip is more comparative to mescaline than to mushrooms. `Noone ever really knows,' seems to be a recurrent theme. I have a much greater ability to describe this trip as it happens than I have encountered with other hallucinogens. I'm finding more than typical meaning in words I am writing. I became fixated with `Being Still'\ldots 



8pm - Spilled my first glass of water.

Thoughts:

	It was really nice. It made me cry.

	Some people are so very carefully wrapped up in themselves that it would take a long time to make them unwrap.



9pm? - I got dressed and walked two blocks to a local coffee shop. It was very hot, and I dressed a little too warmly for the weather. The environment on a typical summer evening in a residential neighborhood was very distracting and almost overwhelming. The crowd at the coffee shop was very alert and chaotic, and I experienced some paranoia. I felt it best to not stay long, and only spoke to one person.



10pm - Still going very strong. Visuals. Increased awareness. Very thirsty. Feeling slightly tired.

	-Earlier I felt as if I were in a container of no sight, no sound; echoing through me. I was moving in and out of these chambers on the x, y and z axes.



1am?? - started drinking scotch to go to sleep. Still very `up'.



3am - Finally fell to sleep.



730am - woke up and could not get back to sleep. Mind still felt very active, but the majority of the effects of the trip were gone.



Reflection: I enjoyed the experience. I did not stray far from my notebook the whole trip, and had an enlightening time exploring my writing and thoughts on recent events in my life. I realized more than ever that I'm a fairly morbid person at heart, and that I'm very comfortable with that.



     Thoughts of having people around to talk to on the same level as me were appealing. When I try this again, I want to do it with a friend or two that take a similar dosage.



     I also began thinking on being still, as I mentioned earlier. This is concentrating on being as still as I can be in order to more carefully appreciate everything going on around me from moment to moment, by noticing the states of inactivity between moments at a very exact level. I've carried this with me since the trip, and feel pleased with the event.



Caution:

This is a very potent hallucinogen. I have had experience with LSD, mescaline, 5MEO-DIPT, DXM, and mushrooms, some at high doses, and this is comparable in strength to any of them.



Care must be taken. The threshold at which the trip becomes obviously perception altering seems to be very sharp. A friend of mine did 10mg and had a trip that was nowhere near in intensity to what I described above. Doses under 6mg seem to have very little effect, although different reports say otherwise.



In all, it was pleasant, though a little long, and I plan to do it again, albeit at a slightly lower dosage.
