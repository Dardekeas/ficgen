A Strawberry Solstice:



One bio-assay that stands out the most was a humble summer solstice blend comprised of 10X celio caapi leaf extract mixed with a 1:1 ratio w/spice [Erowid Note: Spice in this context is referring to N,N-DMT.] numerous other cleansing and medicinal/magical herbs were added to the blend with a focus on resonance with the summer solstice. None of the additives where psychoactive.



Two participants fasted that day, focusing on prayer and centering intentions. I spent the day in the forest meditating and praying and connecting with the land. No hunger was felt, wonderful fast\ldots  at the end of the day preparations where made to break the fast and smoke Changa. Before smoking Changa the participants picked strawberries and spent time in the garden. We broke the fast with strawberries and smoked. Immediately body complaints were felt in the muscles that needed to be worked out energetically. Once I felt more smoothed out and that my chi was flowing nicely, I went deeper into the space. The sacral chakra flared and the spirit of strawberries were all around me dripping red crystalline fruits with vines sensually reaching out and wrapping around my consciousness. I met and communed with the spirit of strawberry and It told me about the way it attracts those to it by offering sensual pleasure and sugar, that this is how it has thrived over the years because of this gift, and encouraged me to think of offering my gifts in like. I was blown away\ldots  



I took another hit and went deeper to discover that voice of the vine telling me very clearly that all of the things I had prayed for that day were distractions and that all I really needed was to be clear within my self. A light above me and within me merged together and I felt my hands move toward that light recommitting myself to that clarity. We surfed that consciousness for hours. With Changa or Harmala and Spice enhanced leaf I am able to continue smoking, a tolerance is not built up and I can keep going with it, maintaining a peak even if I like for hours at a time. The best analogy I can make is to use a surfing comparison. Instead of taking one long hit as one would with spice, and then floating back from `hyperspace' to my body which to me is like bombing a wave and just letting it drive me towards the shore\ldots  instead I ride the crest of the wave kicking up to stay on the crest until the wave breaks. This is done by smoking around every 15/20 minutes. if this is done no real tolerance is built in the slightest. Waiting past that point it can become difficult to maintain the crest of the wave so to speak.



We took a break to eat, hitting it again an hour later to our surprise it was just as effective. This really showed me that fasting and ceremonial preparation, has an extreme effect on how Changa can work. It breaks down the dieta dynamic to its simplest points. On ayahausca as well I might point out that the clarity and lack of intoxication caused by tea is gone. There is no confusion, only incredible clarity with Changa. The voice of the vine, the guidance is all there, the cleansing purge quality can be meted out by working the energy with tai chi, qi-gong, reiki etc., and get the same benefits. However if it is a purge I were looking for, I could focus that energy somaticly and it will help purge out energies I need forcefully `expelled'. Changa is straight to the point, no dealing with petty inner psychodynamic visionary dramas. It goes straight to the point, providing insights and clarity.



Changa is truly the next evolutionary step of the complex synergistic shamanic technology that we have come to know as Ayahuasca, Yage, Daime, Natema, Hoasca, Kamarampi, Oni xuma, and to those modern western enthusiasts Aya. Now it's no longer a tea\ldots  now it is a smoke\ldots  that can be made of many other plants, from caapi leaf and vine, to passion flower extracts, to syrian rue and many many tryptamine containing life forms as well. Ayahuasca has changed, like the visions it produces, morphing anacondas and boas, shifting jaguars, it has transformed, adapted, shifted its shape, altered and reinvented its relationship with humans\ldots  now it is become Changa\ldots  the way of smoke\ldots .
