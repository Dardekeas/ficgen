So I tried poppy seed tea..



my wife was at work for 12 hours so I decided to try it.  I went to my local supermarket and got 15 oz (equilviant to like 500g).  I was shocked to realized (the average dose of 500g) is quite a bit!! like 2 WHOLE cups..I added about 15 oz of lemon juice (about half a liter) and let it sit for about 30 minutes while stirring every 5 minutes\ldots 



then I added 2 cups of boiling nestea, stirred and let sit for another 10 minutes.  When I tried to strain it, coffee filters take too damn long, so I used an old shirt. I think I got about a little over 2 cups of fluid so I guickly guzzled it down\ldots tastes BAD! like peanuts and lemon dispite the 7 packets of sweet and low I added.



I sat down and watched Jackie the Jokeman's video and waited for my buzz\ldots  in about 45 mins I started to get light headed and my shoulders numb and fuzzy\ldots and just kinda tapered there.. I thought after 2-3 hours my buzz would increase but it never did.  The buzz was equilivant to one percocet with 1 or 2 beers..not that strong. about 6 hours later I just got tired and went to sleep.  I guess because of my weight this was too low of a dose, I kinda was dissapointed, all that for a buzz I could of gotten from 4-5 beers.
