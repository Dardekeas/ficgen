I wanted to include my report due to the less researched method of administration, insufflation. I have also tried oral and smoked doses.



I came into possession of 500mg (verified by mg scale) of 2C-I obtained from a reputable rc vendor. This was dissolved into 100ml of vodka (5mg/1ml)and evaporated to obtain desirable and accurate doses.



I am 30 years old, a smoker and enjoy having a drink. Previous experience with MDMA, LSD, Mushrooms, Meth, Weed and various others. I am not on any medication but drink coffee and smoke cigarettes.



I've yet to research oral doses more fully, but have tried it in the 10mg range (next time I'll try 20mg), which I compare to 3-5mg insufflated. I've tried smoking 5-10mg with subtle effects, and found it wasteful. I have yet to vapourize it cleanly. It does leave a black residue-yuck.



I found that 2.5-5mg insufflated is a pleasant threshold dose that would able me to go about my daily activities. This would give me a sense of wellbeing and happiness that lasts a few hours. I found synergy with alcohol and weed. While drinking I found that it is beneficial to drink water in between to combat dehydration and a possible headache.



My last trial was with 5x5mg insufflated over a period of 10 hrs. I would typically boost every 1-2 hours to chase and increase effects. On my last line I experienced shifting/swirling/digital effects for the first time, that were intriguing and by no means overpowering. Insufflation has always been accompanied by euphoria and often with a MDMA type body glow.



The benefit of insufflating this product is the fast come up. Typically a few minutes to 1/2hr to peak. I have not tried insufflating larger amounts and would not attempt doses over 7.5mg due to possible nausea and other unknown side effects.



I really enjoy 2C-I and plan to experiment with oral doses in the future, with a further 5mg insufflated if need be. I find 2C-I quite habit forming insufflated, in that I feel a need to redose to maintain or increase the experienced high. There is also some tolerance developing with daily use. I did it on 4 out of 6 days. It just feels too good.  Not enough is known about 2C-I to warrant reckless experimenting. Nor is it a good idea to experiment daily. Who knows what neurochemicals it may deplete or if it affects the immune system.



To date I have not experienced a hangover with 2C-I but came up with the flu a few days later.



For me it increases sexual pleasure (more primal)and is a great mood enhancer. I enjoy weed and alcohol while on it and found it to synergise incredibly with BZP. I plan to experiment further.



My 2 cents.



Take care everyone and experiment in moderation. Thank You Shulgin.
