It's been 3-4 years since I have taken dexamphetamine, but it seems like yesterday. I feel somewhat relieved to learn that someone went through to an extent what I have gone through. I took this drug for ADD, and was prescribed it at the end of my first year at high school. I practically had it shoved down my throat, crushed in my drinks etc. I didn't think I had such a deficiency but nonetheless got used to taking the tablets. I was generally good at school but found myself taking them more for the euphoric pleasure I would sometimes derive from them. 



My problems occured in my final year of school, I was determined to get into a good university. I would take, approximately once my problem escalated throughout the year about\ldots  8 pills a day when I was supposed to take only 3, 2 1/2.



It was fucked up, I couldn't smoke dope coz I would get totally fucking paranoid. I heard voices all day long and kind of got used to them. I was popular at school yet in my own mind it was a chaotic paranoid mess. I would pop pills in the toilets between classes for I never told anyone that I was on them. I snorted them at nightclubs sometimes etc. etc. I even had delusions that my teachers would speak in code, as if treating me different coz they knew about my taking the tablets but no-one else did, and thus would speak in a different voice to me or whatever\ldots . it was terrible I have a rash of pimple scars on my back, which is one of the drawbacks. Let me merely add that the drug is not what it seems\ldots
