I never really tried any kind of amphetamine until last October when midterms came around. It was my freshman year of college and I was terrified of my midterms so my friend gave me some adderall. I took about 150mg orally, got a B+ on the test, and didn't touch the stuff again until December. I started blowing it with my boyfriend at the time, and eventually it was a bi-weekly activity. My parents sent me all this money and I would spend it all on drugs -- I could get 200 for about 30\$, 100mgs for me and 100mgs for my boyfriend.



I loved the stuff, the way it made everything speed up. I even enjoyed the side effects that were supposed to be bad; the jaw clenching and the dry mouth and needing to pee ALL THE TIME. Because everything was funny and euphoric when I blew it. Eventually I broke up with my boyfriend and used it to get myself out of my depressive rut. I did well in all of my classes and had so much fun with my friends -- it was the perfect drug. I had wanted to lose weight, and of course that was easy since food was totally revolting.



And when I was sick it was hard to blow, but if I could manage it, I swear the stuff would clear up my sinuses! I think it might have made me weak, when I came down after blowing a couple hundred over the course of a night I could barely move. A good trick is to get some ephedra and take it when I come down. It gives me a nice little bump back up without bringing me up enough to make me come down again. Drinking orange juice also helped so much when I came down, probably because after no eating for a couple days my blood sugar would be seriously low. When I went on binges for like, 4 days at a time I would start to hallucinate, which was fun. And once I had sex while I was hallucinating and that was amazing.



I wish I could say something like `and then I realised it was wrong and I stopped forever' or something, but the truth is that I'm still looking for more and really want it all the time. It definitely changed my life, and made me go a little bit crazy, which my therapist says might be permanent. It's worth it, though, I think.
