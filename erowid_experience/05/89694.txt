I do not know exactly what is in the legally obtained packet that I have now sampled on 4 different occasions.  That's a little frustrating, that in this nudge-nudge-wink-wink fringe legality that we are currently dealing with, the information available on the products is limited---one thing this isn't is what it is labeled as, which is stain remover.  Anyway, broadly speaking, it is Meow.  It is an absolutely wonderful addition to my life, and I will be using it regularly.



I have insufflated it and I have mixed it with water and drunk it.  I will discuss drinking it (250 mg of the particular brand I have been using mixed with cup or so of water, down it all at once), which gives what I think is a stronger high, and it also gives me a moment of fairly strong nausea about a half-hour after consumption. I haven't yet actually succumbed and puked, but it's something I'm coming to realize is part of the deal if I drink this stuff. No big deal---I'm actually already high by then and feeling like all is right, so I just take this nausea in stride, and it passes pretty quickly.  Still---I won't drink it on an empty stomach.  The other physiological reactions I note are sweating pretty profusely during the initial rush, and a bit of heart racing.  



It comes on strong and fast---15 minutes after drinking it, I'm feeling it, 20 minutes is stronger still, and it continues to increase up to about 40 minutes after consumption, when it levels off for a great, ecstasy-like ride that lasts until about two hours after consumption.  I don't note the same abrupt comedown that others do, it fades out nicely for me.  I am able to resist any urge to redose---or give in to that urge, as the situation calls for.



Among the features of the high for me---keeping in mind, this is drinking it mixed with water, and I do think that produces a different high than insufflating---are: A rather interesting time distortion during the first rush---moments linger as time slows down.  A strong mood elevation---life is good, and this reminds me that I know that.  I want to tell the people I love that I really do love them.  Music, which can be the foreground of many highs for this music lover, fades to the background while I contemplate life and love and friendship.  There are no visual or aural hallucinations, and this is not a psychedelic experience, it's a bliss thing.  



I don't lose touch with reality, but am rather overwhelmed by reality's silver lining.



As I write this, I have obtained this legally, in a perfectly above-board commercial transaction, using a credit card.  I want this situation to continue [\ldots ] This stuff is pretty strong.
