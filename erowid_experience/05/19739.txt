Ive researched for awhile and I couldnt find much info on Fetanyl. This shit is something serious. At first I didnt think much of a drug which you take by sucking on a lollipop. But it would teach me lesson.



To start off I would like to say I have used pretty much every drug 

imaginable. My favorite is opiates. But in my experience with those I've yet to come across Fentanyl. Until when I was on vacation in Orlando, Florida with a good buddy of mine. His brother had recently had all the skin de-gloved from his right leg and was given Fentanyl lollipops called Actiqs for when he was to change his bandages. 



One night my buddy `V' came home with three Actiqs and five 40mg Oxycontin. We had about an ounce of regular grade pot and we where set for a nice evening. We agreed that we would split everything up farely and evenly. Since he and I have had a past of fighting over drugs we always take certain precautions to avoid those situations. Plus pain killers can make us both irretiable. So anyways we decided that I would get 2 Actiqs and 2 Oxycontin for the evening. While he would have the left over lollipop and 3 Oxycontin. So we were set.



V explained that the best way to dose on the lollipop was to stick up in the very corner of the mouth and to twirl fast till it desolved. Also if you just suck on it you will probably get very sick and throw up. I found this act of twirling the sucker very annoying and a pain in the ass. But I certainly didnt want to waste it. While doing this we were driving around in the car and we decided to stop at a local grocery store parking lot to break up the first Oxycontin of the night. I decide it would be best to wait since I was dosing on the Fentanyl and I wasnt sure how I would react. So I finished off the gross rasberry tasting lollipop and was already noticable fucked. My eyes were half close and blood shot. Which was weird cause I hadnt even smoked a bowl yet. I felt a strong Pain killer high. But I wasnt as fucntional as I usually am on pain killers. It was way more fucked up than Oxycontin but less euphoric. Way less euphoria but shit I still was diggin' this high. 



V had just snorted about 80mgs of Oxycontin and we decided to walk around the grocery store. I didnt realize how fucked I was till we got in the store. I was hardly functional. We walked around forever. I lost complete track of time. I found myself just staring off at nothing and daydreaming. I can hardly remember that whole grocery store deal but I remember having to run from the store manager because V had been caught stealing. 



So we jsut said fuck it to being out on the town and decided to ride back to V's mommy's house to chill and snort some Oxycontin. Then without even realizing it I finished off the other Actiq. I remember being in this zombie like daze and hearing V say, `What the fuck, you already ate both of them?'. I didnt realize it. I can hardly remember thinking, Holy shit what where you thinking. I was FUCKED. 



We arrived at V's mom's house where I stumbled in and fell on the couch. I was soooooooo tired. V broke up about 80mgs of Oxycontin and I snorted a 40mg line. Damn! I was a fucking zombie. I remember smoking some pot out of the gravity bong and being real itchey. I remember sitting on the couch w/ V and we were just talking shit to each other.



Next thing I know V' mom is waking me up to help her with something first thing I do is run into the bathroom and hurl my guts out. I was sick for the rest of the day. Puking ever hour or so. I'd try to eat but about 15 minutes later I would puke it up. V was also sick from snorting about 100 something mgs of Oxycontin that night. so all day we both went through hell. But honestly it was worth it. I doubt I'll ever see anythere Actiq ever again. But if I do I'll defiantly do it. I just think I went alittle over-board the first time.

PEACE
