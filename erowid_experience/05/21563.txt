I had heard alot about kava good and bad.



After alot of research I found a supplier of high quality kava (the stuff at local stores or health food markets is useless) and got a good receipe.



First of all the kava must come from a plant that is at least 3 years old to have any stimulating effects. Secondly it must be prepared correctly. I took 2 ozs. of 6 year old ground kava root and 1 quart of water (heated to 170 degrees F) never boil it will kill the chemicals.



I put in a blender and blended on high for 5 minutes (must have a high quality blender). After blending I took some frozen pinapple juice that I put in ice cube trays, (about 10 cubes), 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 shot rum, and 3 tablespoon of honey, blended again for I minute. I drank in gulps of 1/2 cups, shaking the blender container before each pour (must always do this as the stimulating properties are not water soluble).



The effects are wonderful. Deeply relaxing, both body and mind. Numbing of mouth, and muscle relaxation are also other effects. The buzz is very social and I simply feel wonderful. Also with the right kava there is no hangover, although i have had viscious hangovers with other kava.



The buzz lasted 4-6 hours. I got the receipe and kava from a woman in the islands of Vanuatu and believe me the product and preperation are key, otherwise I spend time drinking stuff that taste like bitter dishwater that does nothing at all.
