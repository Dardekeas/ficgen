I haven't done anything psychedelic related since last year in March (2013). In that month, I did MDMA once and then some form of LSD(I still to this day have no idea what I took) on two different occasions. Since about November 2013, I have smoked Cannabis regularly(1-3 times a week). I have been wanting to trip every now and then but I usually don't have the time. About the time I got the 2C-C, I started looking for a good time to do it. 



It was a sunday night when we finally did it. To get ready, I cleaned my entire room spotless, got some different beverages and plenty of good music. My parents were upstairs(they never come downstairs) and me and my girlfriend(N) sat on the futon and took a 20 mg tablet each at 10:15 p.m. I had played drums at church that morning and then took a good long nap before finishing up the preparations. 



0:00-I was pretty nervous before I took it since I hadn't done it in so long, but I was also very excited. 



0:45-I had my first tracer in almost a year. Very exciting! I was also definitely feeling some sort of nice body high. Anxiety was completely absent. At this point and at every other point in the night, nothing really seemed to go any slower than usual. N also commented on this. 



0:56-Visuals are definitely starting. Objects were starting to look sharper before this and could possibly see things moving.



1:05-Come up was nice and slow and relaxing. I did notice that it was slightly overwhelming at times. 



1:15-Visuals are HERE!



1:40-Light Visuals, Good Body High, Music sounds great. Lots of laughing and enjoyment with each other.



`I appreciate everything better. My handwriting is like spiders. Shadows grow. Kinda creepy unless you think happy :) very hard to write.' -N



2:45-Visuals going away for sure. I feel great, and maybe still scatter brained. I am definitely still high. I still have little flashes of light in my peripheral vision. At this point we decide to wind down and lay down and go to sleep. We end up making love and it was amazing.



This was for sure a light trip compared to whatever I took last year. The visual hallucinations were not even close to as detailed. It could have been a little trippier, but it was fine. On the other stuff, the little lines on my hand were moving! I enjoyed the anxiety missing and the light visuals, if only they could have lasted longer. I intend on pushing the dose up just a bit and possibly smoking with it. Another note, this substance made me laugh much much more. 



Thanks for reading!
