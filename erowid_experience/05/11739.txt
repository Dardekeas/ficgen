For many years I knew of the drug exstacy and had only heard the `facts' from the media.  Very afraid and uneducated about the drug I refused to ever try that drug.  I became very close with some friends of mine who used exstacy several times and only had wonderful things to say about it.  I decided I should research the drug online and see what I found out, I looked here on erowid and dancesafe and other websites to see what the effects were, percautions to take, etc.  I decided to attend a party and try exstacy.  The pill I purchased had been tested to make sure it contained mdma and not some other drug, I made sure my friends stayed near me until I knew I was safe and I could handle the effects of the drug on my own.  I drank plenty of water throughout the night.  



As for the experience itself, my life was changed forever.  After being at the party for an hour or so I took my pill and started dancing about 45 minutes later I started to feel like liquid moving with the music and I had this sensational feeling like tingly all over and so happy that I was listening to great music with good friends.  Throughout the night my mind expanded and matured growing with every new enjoyed sensation and experience with friends and strangers.  I truly felt like I knew who I was for the first time, I was me and I knew what I wanted what I enjoyed and I was ok with it.  I felt the need to be in the company of my friends and other and was willing to give back massages, hugs, or be a dancing partner.  When normally I would be too shy to do any of that.  Throughout the night I grew more and more and felt like my life was finally falling into place.  



I have been forever changed\ldots  I have found that mdma is a great tool to expand your mind, find yourself, and become closer to people you care about.  If it is used properly and you know what you are doing exstacy is a great drug.
