I have had 2 experiences on Dramamine, 1 with weed and 1 without weed and let me say that I am never ever taking this shit without weed again. The first time I took it I bought a 10 pack and dumped them all at once. This produced the most annoying high I have ever felt. The second time I took this drug I smoked a good amount of weed before and after taking the pills. The night went something like this:



6:00pm- Smoked a nice bowl of green and invited some friends round to my house.



7:30- `J' \& `A' arive at my house with some weed and the dramamine I asked them to pick up for me. I ate the whole pack (10 pills, they come in packs of ten in Australia) and smoked some more weed. [Erowid Note: It is important to always check the per-pill dosage, different products can contain very different amounts of an active chemical.]



8:15- Nicely stoned, dramamine starting to kick in. Drank some coffee to keep my brain awake. 



9:00- Dramamine in full affect. Feeling unable to move and seeing purple and red things moving around my room. Strange patterns appearing on my wall when I look at it.



10:30- Total stoning affect, nomatter how hard I try I cannot move. `J' and `A' are talking but I cannot understand them. I am staring at my wall and seeing what appears to be a short asian man in one of those cone shaped hats. Not a very detailed picture, just different shades of white and some purple but it was there in front of me. 



11:00- `J' and `A' leave my house and I continue smoking. Eventually I fell asleep. I awoke the next morning with no hangover effect at all. I experienced very little itch this trip and have weed to thank.





I have learned from this experience that weed reduces the itch that Dramamine causes. I think that few people have discovered this as I would think that most people dumping dramamine have run out of weed. The stoning affect of Dramamine is unlike anything I have ever taken but you need to be prepared. The pack says `may cause drowsiness' and they're not kidding. You need coffee or something to keep you going otherwise you fall asleep or become too sleepy to appreciate the high. I want to try a Dramamine + weed + speed combo as I believe it would be alot of fun.
