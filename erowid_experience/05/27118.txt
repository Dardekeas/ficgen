Me and a friend were sitting around one day, smoking some pot and playing on the computer. Earlier that week I had been out looking for shrooms and had found me about 50 of them, I had also powdered them after drying them. So, being our usual druggie selves we just couldn't keep our hands off of them, but 50 are so few\ldots 



We decided smoking them would have to be tried out, which turned out to be\ldots  Strange. At first, it felt like I was coming slightly up on the shrooms - but there it halted. In mid-onset. From there on out it's hard to remember things, but I didn't go any higher\ldots 



The very next monday was a surprise for me, talking to friends and relatives who told me of meetings with them I could not remember, places I've been I have no recollection of and such. Very, very strange\ldots
