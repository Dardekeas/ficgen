I first tried dipt at a 50mg dose, which distorted sounds like I'd expected. The next time was at 100mg during a 400mg dxm dose comedown. I think the dxm made dipt more potent. 



Yesterday I tried 150mg DiPT alone and was tripping very hard for about 2-3 hours, and the audio effects didn't wear off until T 12:00. What really gets me is, why does everyone, including TiHKAL, say that Dipt is mainly auditory? I find it is every bit as powerful as DPT, if not more so. Anyway, my point in typing this up is not to explain my trip, but to say to anyone thinking of trying DIPT: It is not `mellow'. The tryptamine buzz is strong as is the entire high, or experience. Don't fuck around with this chemical.
