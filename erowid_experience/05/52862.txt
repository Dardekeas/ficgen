Okay, it was a Saturday night and I decided to have a quiet one and meditate, well I didn't get around to meditating the way I planned straight away, instead I just relaxed a bit and listened to the new tool album, it was not the first time I had heard it so was getting quite familiar to hearing it, in this comfortable space I had the flash of an idea, I had been smoking lion's tail and Mugwort and Damiana with Marijuana lately as it altered the high a little, and on separate occasions I had lotus with marijuana, and lotus with alcohol. 



Each of these herbs I had enjoyed in smoking mixes and tea, but I decided to mix them to about a 2 gram mix, considering how many herbs were involved it was not really that much of each, as I smoked I got the urge to draw, it was unlike the typical high of each drug, but it was in no way a strong high, I have become used to discerning the slight and subliminal effects of these drugs quite well so at this point of the high, drawing pictures which were the same as I would normally draw just a little more tribal, at one point I felt a tingling within my feet, in the soles, I realized the opportunity being presented to me, as my feet chakras began to harness energy, I stopped drawing and began to focus on the energies building in my feet, as I cycled through my breathing 7 for 7 , basically there was this feeling of branches and vines of energy coiling and growing up through my legs, anchoring me and feeding me with energy from the earth. 



As the feeling rose through my legs I continued my steady and calmly focused breathing, I placed my hands in the root chakra mudra and steadily the blackness of the back of my eyelids began to filter into a deep blood red, at this point I was feeling a mild excitement as the energies swirled around at the base of my spine, it is hard to put the experience into words because my stream of consciousness was silenced for the time being, I used images and symbols and imagination to push and instigate the trip to go further, when on Lion's tail I find that regulating my heart rate is essential, the lotus seemed to sedate the emotionally overwhelming aspect of the Lion's tail, and synergized with the Mugwort and passionflower to give a divine clarity to the high. 



The feeling progressed onto my sacral chakra and the color I saw behind my eyes was becoming a bright orange, similar to that of Lion's tail flowers, the sacral chakra never seems to present me with emotionally challenging images, instead it represents itself to me through sacred geometries which outline in my imagination like liquid fire, made of a white iridescent light, this is an imagination technique which creates the image in the centre of the mind it is neither O.E.V or C.E.V, but just an imagination within, after focusing on the pranic energy for about 5 minutes, I began to hold for 4 seconds between each seven second exhalation, this began to move my solar plexus in ways which I can achieve on rarity, but never has the feeling been so well controlled/subdued to keep me from being distracted away from the meditation, at this point my veins were pulsating with energy, I felt calm, but my body felt anything but, I could hold the mudras but there was a strange vibrant energy pulsating through my body.



I focused on the energy as a ball of yellow light within and through about five breaths, each at seven seconds each focused upon growing this ball of golden energy, from here I went on to my heart chakra and changed my mudra accordingly and went from an explosive yellow happiness to an implosive green world of feeling and love, this is probably only instigated by the drugs to calm and sedate me enough to continue on with the meditation, beyond this point I became channeled energy through my last three primary chakras, but only believe I got close to an opening with the throat chakra, from here I spent another 45 minutes bringing myself back through each chakra, before I opened my eyes, the only feeling I could describe would be excitement mixed with euphoria, this was an amazing and awakening experience.
