Seeing as how I'm taking it easy while quitting opiates, I figured I'd write a little about my experience with kratom.



I started taking kratom about a year ago, after having some major surgery. I was given oxycodone for a little while after the surgery, and suddenly cut off. Still in pain, I asked around for help, and a friend told me about this plant he had recently heard of, called kratom. After obtaining a small 30 gram bag of kratom and after careful research, I decided to start out with a half a teaspoon of the enhanced bali. An online forum dedicated to this plant stated that one (level) teaspoon of the powder from this vendor was equivalent to 4 grams of material, and I went based on recommendations on that forum as well as information from other sites.



Within 30 minutes of taking kratom on an empty stomach, my pain was gone, and I felt great. I started taking kratom daily for a few months and slowly upped my dose until I was taking about 1 tsp at a time, once a day. I definitely built a quick tolerance this way, but no matter what happened to my tolerance to many of the effects, I always seemed to get a mood boost from the stuff. I eventually ended up quitting cold turkey after 5 months of daily use and. . .no withdrawals! Only some lethargy/laziness for a few days.



Fast forward several months, I have some intense cravings for oxycodone (I only used it for pain originally, and I used less than would get rid of a lot of my pain, yet I would still get high and extremely euphoric when I took it, despite what the doctors said), so I decide to pick up a small amount for a few days of fun. Well, a few days turned into a few weeks. . .a few months, and I was hooked. It is now 8 months later after some horrible issues with addiction, planning my life around my next dose, etc, and I want out. Not only do I feel awful when I dose (no more euphoria, only dysphoria and restlessness), I feel worse when I don't! And at this point I'm up to 30 mg every 3 hours!!



One day after a sudden realization and some serious depression, soul searching, crying. . .I decide I'm going to quit. So I start dosing every 8 hours instead of every 3, and after a lot of pain and about a week, I'm down to 10 mg every 8 hours (30 mg a day). It is at this point I switch completely to kratom. Let me tell you, kratom is a miracle plant for blocking withdrawals. Just a little over 1/4 tsp of the enhanced bali this time around is enough to make me feel euphoric, empathetic, etc (despite my tolerance to oxy), and at the same time blocks all symptoms of withdrawal!



Fast forward to today, six days since my last dose of oxycodone. I'm taking 1/4-1/2 tsp (depending on my needs) every 8-10 hours, hoping to make it 1/4 every 12 very soon. Around day 4-5 I was having some bad body aches associated with the lack of oxy, but I'm doing much better now. I think my body is mostly stabilized on the kratom, and once I quit, that will be it!



This plant has given me my life back, given me my freedom. I used to have to plan everything around oxy: when my next dose would be, dividing pills into days. I'd wake up and have to dose immediately, as I'd be sick with withdrawals every morning. I could literally do nothing in between doses (after the high wore off an hour after dosing). Unlike with the oxy where I'd constantly want a bigger or sooner dose, I have no temptation to up my kratom dose, despite increased euphoria it might bring. I  have no temptation to take a dose sooner than I should, even if I'm in pain/slight withdrawals in the meanwhile. With my 8 hour oxy doses, I'd constantly cheat and do six hour doses here and there. With my 8 hour kratom doses, I'm constantly pushing it to 10 hours here and there. 



I have absolutely no cravings for oxy, nor any temptation to take it right now. Even if I had a nice, big 20 mg line in front of me, I wouldn't have any use for it. Who needs ibogaine when we have kratom?
