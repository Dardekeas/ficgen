As a simple summary, my experience with 5-MAPB is that it is so similar to other MDMA-type euphoric stimulants that I'd guess many people would not be able to tell the difference if it were given to them in a tablet.  I find it less physically stimulating, with less jaw tension and nystagmus for the same level of empathy, euphoria, and fun than many other empathogens. 

I have extensive experience with psychedelics, empathogens, alcohol, and GHB-type drugs. As I get older, I feel more inclined to take small doses of benzodiazepines along with psychedelics or empathogens because the physical annoyances and risks of stimulants definitely seem worse with age. The 5-MAPB that I had access to was verified by a lab after purchase.

5-MAPB is definitely one of the many slightly random variants of MDMA and other empathogenic, euphoriant stimulants. I've tried MDMA, MDE, MDA, MBDB, 4-FA, Methylone, 4-methylmethcathinone, MDPV, and a handful of others. I've tried MDMA and MDPV more than the rest because those have been most available to me over the last decade. With MDMA, I've had the classic heart-opening experience and feel as if it fundamentally changed my perspective on emotion, guilt, and socializing: two decades ago.

These days, when I'm taking a euphoric stimulant empathogen, I'm not usually looking to have a psychedelic, mind-changing experience that breaks through barriers the way that MDMA did the first few times I tried it. I'm usually looking to improve my mood, feel closer to friends and family, have fun, spend intimate or sexy time with my partner, or otherwise have a day or evening where the work world falls away and thoughts turn to love, friendship, sex, music, art, etc.

I've tried 5-MAPB perhaps ten times. I've tried it as a stand alone drug, but have mostly used it in combination with a low dose of alprazolam (.25mg) and low doses of ephedrine (10-15mg).  

The highest dose of 5-MAPB I've taken at a single time has been 40mg oral on an empty stomach, though I've tried rectal administration and found the routes to be similar in potency and duration. Rectal comes on a little faster and ends a little earlier, but perhaps just shifts the timing by 10-15 minutes. When I take 5-MAPB, I'm usually planning on re-dosing at 2-3 hours. 

I experience the effects of 5-MAPB as mostly lifting my mood, making me more social, have more fun, feel more adventurous, inhibitions lowered, sweaty, etc. I find it has less jaw tension than similar levels of other empathogens at similar effect levels. I've had sex while on 5-MAPB a few times and it seems to inhibit erectile capacity less than MDMA and other empathogens, which is a welcome improvement. I have also re-dosed 5-MAPB a number of times in a row, spaced 2-3 hours apart, while I was with someone who was re-dosing MDPV over a 16 hour period. I was not able to physically keep up and eventually fell asleep while the person on MDPV stayed awake (without taking any more) for 6 hours. I woke up six hours later with them still happily web surfing while watching TV.


The following is one report from an evening with 5-MAPB. We went to an all night 300 person costume party and wanted to be awake and social, despite not having slept properly the night before and having worked set up for most of the day. 

T + 0 : 0.25 mg alprazolam, oral,  12.5mg ephedrine , a couple light hits of cannabis bud.

T+ + 60 : Mild stimulant effects notable, definitely feel the heaviness in my body, my feet and knees, lift. I chat with friends as I measure out 40mg of 5-MAPB. The cannabis, alprazolam, and ephedrine are just strong enough to have a clear effect, but similar in strength to one solid shot of alcohol or one strong beer. I finally feel like the evening will be fun, rather than an overly tiring trudge after a long day of working without enough sleep.

T + 1:15 : 40mg 5-MAPB, dissolved in water at 20mg per ml (liquid measurement technique), and then dumped into a little orange juice. Taste is mostly hidden by the OJ. Stomach is mostly empty, though I've had a couple of almonds in the last hour.

T + 1:45 (30 minutes after ingestion) : Clear effects begin. A sense of physical warmth runs across my skin, I'm smiling more. Socializing is easier, but nothing obviously empathogenic.

T + 2:15 (60 minutes after 5-mapb) : Obvious MDMA-type effects with oversharing, touching friends more, over sharing internal thoughts, more interested in listening to other people gush about whatever. Goofy, giggling, smiling, and having a good time at a party I would normally stand back from.  Although 5-MAPB is not as stimulating as MDMA (I would not take ephedrine with MDMA), the mood lift makes walking and dancing around easier. I don't mind the idea of having to walk up and down a long flight of stairs. 

The effects plateau for about 30 minutes and then feel like they are tapering down.

T + 2:45 (90 minutes after 5-MAPB) : I have a couple glasses of champagne and the effects seem to kick back in a bit. Having a great time, a tiny bit of jaw tension noticed, but not much. Definite pupil dilation. No unexpected sweating. A little too huggy and touchy for a friend who is not on MDMA.

T + 3:30 (2:15 after 5-MAPB) : I measure out and three of us take another 40mg 5-MAPB (2ml of liquid). Again as liquid in orange juice. Goes down easy. 

T + 3:45 (15 minutes after second dose) : Effects of second dose now evident. 

T + 4:00 (30 minutes after second 5-MAPB dose): As the effects of the second dose come on, there's a clear increase in intensive over the peak from the first dose. I see it in the faces of my friends who are on the drug and notice that I'm being a little goofier and have more plearusable effects than before. I feel physically restless and am not feeling like sitting down. 

I spent some of my time chatting with some folks on LSD and a couple of people on 5-MeO-MIPT, along with spending time with people on Methylone and a bunch on MDMA. I notice that I'm definitely more speedy-talkative than the folks on the psychedelics. Listening to myself talk to the folks on the LSD or the 5-MeO-MIPT makes me feel slightly manic. My trajectory is definitely in the `I'm going to be high for another couple hours, then I'm going to crash.' and I find myself not wanting to spend too much time socializing with folks unless they are also stimulated.  It's just not mixing well, socially.

T + 4:30 (1 hour minutes after second dose of 5-MAPB): This is the peak and it's fun. Not super strong, not gushing, not swimming, not chewing my cheeks off, but awake, in a geat mood, enjoying wandering around chatting with friends I don't see very often. I feel like having a beer or some champagne. A friend offers me a beer and as I finish that, another offers some whiskey, which I enjoy sipping. 

My mouth is dry and eating is not really on the menu, but drinking beer and whiskey goes well. I can feel the sloppy effects of alcohol begin and it feels like a nice way to extend and enhance the plateau of the euphoric stimulant.

T + 5:30 (2 hours after second dose). Effects slowly start to wear off and I start on another beer.  I note my friends are having a great time and I check in with them. None of us are going to re-dose again, as we're thinking about winding down with some champagne, beer, and some snacks for a couple hours before we can lie down.

Over the next couple hours, the euphoric effects start to wear off, but pleasantly so.

T + 7:30 (4 hours after second dose) : Feet are starting to drag, but brain stimulation continues. I definitely won't be able to sleep without some benzo or zolpidem, but I'm still enjoying walking around chatting. I make some late night snacks for friends, do some clean up, organize our stuff, and say good night to friends who are heading to bed.

T + 8:30 (5 hours after second dose) : Take 5mg of zolpidem and fall asleep for a few hours until it's time to get up and break down the party in the morning.

The next day, I feel tired, but don't feel burned out or brain crusty like I do after taking MDMA. The main tiredness is from having two nights in a row with four hours of sleep and full days of setting up and tearing down for a 300 person party. 

Both of the two people who took 5-MAPB with me that night were trying it for the first time. I spoke at length to one of them and they found the 40mg taken twice at 2-3 hours to be just about right. Fun, mood enhancing, empathogenic, inhibition lowering, and not too pushy. Overall, a very pleasant evening.
