I was recently proscribed Provigil for AD/HD by my very progessive minded shrink to see if I reacted better to it than Adderall.



One 200mg tablet upon waking.  Effects felt within 30min. Very subtle mental alertness at first.  There was also a slight buzzing that defies all my previous experiences with the `euphoria' side effect of other stimulants.  It was euphoria-like, but very distinctly NOT euphoria.  More like a floatiness.



I noticed other amphetamine-like side effects, but very subdued.  Things like jaw tension, which was less than a `tension' and more like a jaw `awareness'.  This awareness was felt throughout my entire face.  Listening to music, I found I could feel the music on my face.. like it was hyper sensitive to the vibrations.  I was alert.. very alert.  Bordering on paranoia.  I found that if I didn't have something to concentrate on, I was prone to drift from distraction to distraction, as if my ADD was made worse.



Reading was a treat, though.  Usually when I sit down to read I look up about once a minute, distracted by something around me.  I found that I was so intensly into what I was reading, I was able to tune the distractions out.  In this respect, it worked better than Adderall.  Though when I didn't have anything to focus on, my mind would race and loop even worse than normal.



Primary effects were felt for 12 hours.. and I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep.  A few shots of scotch were needed to calm me down.  I also noticed that I was very sensitive to the effects of alcohol and the `buzzing' came back in full force after 2 shots.
