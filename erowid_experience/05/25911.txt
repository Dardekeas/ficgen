One thing I want to clear up thougha absinthe is NOT just wormwood extract mixed with Vodka.  Believe me this is not the same thing.  Why?  Because there are something like 15-20 different herbs in the original and real Absinthe mixes.  Some of them have effects as well as the wormwood.



I have been drinking the newly reinstated Pernod version of Absinthe with Thujone (highly recommended, but not the best).  If you really want to try the Green Fairy, then do it justice and drink REAL absinthe!  And drink it the right way with sugar and very, very cold water. This drink is a very delicious drink if done right.  It is an awsome drink when in a party setting with friends, like a dinner party or something like that.  Very mellow and pleasant. The effects are less dramatic then most of the `fairy' tales (get it).  I think the big thing to note here is that Thujone basically couteracts some of the affects of alchohol, thus giving a better buzz then without.  It basically keeps your mind going, when normal alchohol itself would shut your mind down.  



Because this stuff tastes so good, it can bite fast.  Just like Everclear, which was my favorite for a long time.  If you can taste the Everclear, it's pretty darn strong.  Same holds with Absinthe.  You have to remember, even though it tastes so good, it's VERY strong.  So, if done right, it tastes great and provides a nice warm buzz.
