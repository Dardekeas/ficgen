It was prom night, and we were already planning on rolling that night with some E pills waiting for us afterwards. As the night came to an end and we headed to the after party and my friend showed up and handed me the pill. Already more than excited I popped it around 12:20 A.M and awaited the effects. I usually feel my pills start to kick in or creep around 30 to 45 minutes, but wasn't feeling anything. Thinking it was a dud pill I started to get upset and wasn't feeling the happy vibes I had before.  The next thing I know my friend walks into the house and said he just bought some MDA off an old friend of mine that showed up and asked if I wanted to split it with him and I jumped at the opportunity to try this, since I never took pure MDA before. We went into the bathroom and pulled apart the plastic capsule that held a chalky white powder inside and evened it out into two nice bumps; we each took a bump up the nose and hoped we would finally feel something.



In about 10 minutes I started to feel very groggy and felt no need to stand up, I wasn't all that sure what was going on but I felt very odd I didn't have the rolling feeling, I just felt really high and couldn't really comprehend what was going on. I stumbled out of the house looking for my friend that had taken the other half and found him outside throwing up and felt very nauseous myself but managed to hold it back. After getting some water in him we sat in my friends car awaiting to go to another house and that's when everything cleared up and I really felt like I was on E, but this time I had visual effects to go along with it. The dark insides of the car seemed to be dripping down and the sky outside was blinking a black and white, and I looked at the street and the light patterns made me feel like we were speeding down the road and I felt very happy and couldn't stop myself from talking to everyone.



It was starting to hit me hard as the body high was becoming really intense and I never had problems with grinding my teeth before but this time was different I couldn't stop myself from grinding and needed gum quickly. We headed to our friends house by the beach and while they're went into her backyard and that's when the effects of the MDA really showed. Unlike the times when I popped a normal E pill with just MDMA (feeling talkative, very social, and having lots of energy) I just noticed how beautiful everything was and everything around me seemed and felt like it stood out more and I noticed the colors and small details of everything. I spent most of my night being amazed at the thousands of paint chips on the side of her shed and the bee hive right above it and how beautiful it seemed, and everything to me could be related to art. My friend and I made our way down to the beach and he had a revelation about the stars while laying on the beach that made so much sense and it was funny noticing him think so hard. All in all I didn't notice the come down at all I was too busy enjoying myself with my friends.



Definitely one of my favorites and on the top of my list, very different than MDMA to me and way better.
