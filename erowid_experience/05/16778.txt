I have not seen any reports regarding Marihuanilla on Erowid so I thought I would share my experience with the substance.



I received an ounce of Marihuanilla via an internet distributer. The first thing that I did when it arrived was attempt to roll a joint of the material\ldots not an easy task! The little flowers are hard to separate from the stems, and they are loaded with tiny `thorns'. It took about 5 papers to finally get a poorly rolled cigarette.



And the smoke\ldots not only is does it taste terrible, but it is so harsh that it is nearly impossible to hold it in the lungs! Coughing and gagging, I finally managed to finish the joint. I did notice a very light buzz. It was sort of a `tired' buzz, comparable to a hit or two of poor quality grass. Smoking the material is simply not worth it.



Since I did not want to throw away the entire bag, I decided to try making a tea of the substance. I used about 1/4 ounce (roughly 7 grams) of material in a perculator with about 6 cups of water. I let the tea brew for about 15 minutes, then let it cool for a while. The tea was surprisingly pleasant to drink, and tasted similar to regular store bought tea. The effects were also a bit more pronounced than when smoking the material. The buzz was still mild, but was accompanied by a feeling of well-being and very subtle visuals. 



In conclusion, marijuanilla is absolutly worthless to smoke. Perhaps if it were slow dried of cured it would be better, but I cannot recommend it based on my experience. The tea is definately the better option, but don't expect much. At least the substance is inexpensive (\$13-\$15 per ounce), so for some it may be worth experimenting with. I will move on to other things.
