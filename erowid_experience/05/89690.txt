I was prescribed Marinol for trouble eating after a traumatic event. Though in general I didn't abuse it, even at the prescribed dose it was far too much, I was beyond high for hours on end, and it had a very strong dissociative effect without as much euphoria. Everything was incredibly overstimulating and while music sounded good, thoughts were stoned, and all the usual weed stuff, it was all just far far too much.



Honestly, though I was able to eat more (serious serious munchies) around 10mg than 5, even the 5 was overstimulating. The come-up is incredibly long, as I mentioned before, the dissociating effects were very very strong.



It's honestly not worth it. There's no real comparison to weed here, it's going to makes me feel dissociated with little euphoria and a sick poisoned feeling.
