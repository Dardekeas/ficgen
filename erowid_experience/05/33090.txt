I've used salvia many times before and until one night I had never really tripped off it.  The times before I just recieved a few visual changes and simulation.  The effect I like the most was the incredible mood lift I received after I smoked salvia.  I still use it as an antidepressant by taking small amounts of it orally.  Yet after one night where I took a huge inhale of a full salvia bowl I was sent into another world.



It scared me a little bit but I wouldn't say there was any emotional  trauma.  It was the day after the trip that I felt as if something was different.  There was movement in my peripheral vision that I can't even describe.  When i concentrated on a bright object like a tree or plant life i would feel like I was tripping again.  



I've realized now that after reading about HPPD that many of these visions have not gone away yet.  Colors seem very bright and when I get high they don't get much brighter.  I see transparent blobs in my vision and black splotches.  When i concentrate on an object something just seems off and strange.  I feel as if I'm not as conscious to my surroundings.



This could be something completely different and I may not have HPPD but if this is true I have no idea what it is.  Salvia's a great drug the best anti-depressant I've tried but it might be best to keep it at low doses.
