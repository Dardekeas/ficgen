I have done Coricidin a few times before but the time I took 20 pills was the trippiest. Usually I only take 10 or 12 but I had 3 packs of it so I first took 16, waited about an hour and nothing happened so I decided to take 4 more to kick it in. About 30 minutes later I started to feel some of the effects and about 15 minutes after that I was fucking rolling. I was on IRC and I suddenly noticed that I couldnt see the screen anymore, I mean I could see the actual monitor but I couldnt focus on a single point long enough to see my cursor or read the text. I tried to stand up but it scared the shit out of me so I just sat down and thought about a lot of scary shit for a long time. By this time my vision was so fucked up I had a cigarette in my hand and somehow I couldnt see how long it was or where the image of it began and ended (this is hard to explain). Also sometimes I would look at objects in my room and suddenly it seemed like they were very far away although I knew they were right in front of me. My heart was beating extremely fast and I had to get naked because I was pouring sweat. I spent hours sitting motionless just drinking water and having terrifying thoughts, and I became convinced I was going to die in my sleep that night. I spent several hours in a state of catatonic fear but gradually I calmed down. I felt like I had regained control over my body and my mind which was comforting. I tried unsuccessfully to sleep a few times so I ended up staying up all night.



It was a terrifying experience but at the same time I was kind of proud of myself for surviving it without going insane. It was like Fear and Loathing-style.
