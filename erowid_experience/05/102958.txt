I have Taken LSD Twice before one low dose and then one high dose that was a very profound experience, with little ego left in me for the following years after. I also have been consuming moderate amounts of MDMA for the past 4 months or so and had rolled maybe 4 days before this experience. Two years and 3 months later I've acquired 5 150 ug hits of LSZ.



I had quite a calm mindset before I did this, but have been anticipating it for quite a while so I did feel just slightly anxious I may be taking too much, but quelled it quite sufficiently.



T= 08:30 pm - I give two to my girlfriend and I chew up the other 3, they tasted like paper and a little ink, we then sat on the couch and started a playing a cool new version of asteroids on the PlayStation.



T= 08:50pm - +/- I'm not sure if I feel anything, feels like placebo at the moment



T+ 09:00 - +1 OK I can definitely feel something now, my head-space is expanding and I'm feeling a little nauseous.



T= 09:30 - Doesn't feel the same as the LSD I have consumed before, it doesn't fall and rise, I'm just on continual very slight up slope. Playing asteroids now and my playing has improved dramatically, I have very precise thumb movements and the games visuals are quite intense to look at.



T= 10:30 - The come up is still quite intense, I'm wondering if at this point the trip is going to become more tolerable, as I have to lay down to settle my stomach.



T+ 11:00 - Somewhere during this point I hop in the shower with my girlfriend as I was getting some cold sweating, I also end up throwing up, after which I felt a little better, but the intensity of my head-space and to some extent body load,

Was almost intolerable, yet very enjoyable in a way, my girlfriend agrees with me, as she too has felt quite nauseous the entire time.



T= 12:00 - +2 By this time my nausea has gone and and I smoke a bowl of some average cannabis mixed with tobacco. Its very hard to do and I spend over half an hour packing it and subsequently only smoke half.



T= 01:00 am - Laying in the hammock makes for a very comfortable trip and I'm watching the trees above me jump from side to side in my vision, around this point I'm convinced I'm on a plateau and don't expect to climb much higher. Girlfriend believes she peaked around this time or maybe 2:00. I continue walking to and from the hammock and the shed to smoke more cannabis.



T= 03:30 - +3 Around this time my girlfriend has lay down and gone to bed, as her body is exhausted. I'm on the computer and start to watch a strobe illusion with some nice music. This seemed to act as a catalyst for everything around to warp in my field of vision even more, I then play Shine on you crazy Diamond - Pink Floyd, and its not long before I'm lost in the music with my eyes shut. Loving every single note and piece of silence, it was an amazing feeling. The music got distant but ever more nuanced as I finally broke my concentration for a second, opened my eyes and realised just how far gone I was. 



I almost panicked for a second and thought I had perhaps taken too much as I realized I had still yet to peak, I reassured myself that I was strong and would be able handle the experience well.



T= 04:30am (T+8 hours) - I then lay down with my girlfriend and put my headphones on as I decided to listen to that song again, it was at this point that the music had me writhing on the bed to each note and almost as if it were activating my different chakras, extreme outpouring of emotion soon followed after I removed my headphones, as I felt energy pour out of my heart and my hands, into my girlfriend laying next to me, pretty much passed out(she was quite tired)

	

It is probably around 6:00 am when I finally get too sleep, content feelings run throughout of me and I feel as if my mind is out wandering another place whilst I stay and stare at the ceiling, this was enjoyable,



T= 11:00 am - I wake up and feel like absolutely no time has passed since I slept, I tell my gf that I was extremely glad we did that last night, I cant stop this giant grin on my face, I literally have never felt such uncontrollable intense joy in  my life.



All in all I think this is a very worthwhile lysergamide and will be consuming it again, perhaps in a larger dose, I will probably try not to have so much to eat next time, perhaps that will help the nausea. Also next time I will be listening to music earlier on the experience, as I feel like it really made the entire experience, stimuli was quite intense to look at but I failed to see many visuals,

Despite some coloured lights I could see every now and again.



Standing in the dark also proved to be quite consuming and was interesting to let my mind wander this space.



This drug seemed quite stoning for the entirety of the come up and don't believe it would be suitable for say a festival, I much preferred sitting back and feeling like I was being pushed into the couch.



I continued to have an afterglow all day the next day, I met up with an old friend I hadn't seen for a year and had a beer at the pub, the entire day I had an extremely positive outlook.



Thanks for Reading :)
