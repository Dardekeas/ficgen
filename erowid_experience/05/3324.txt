I took about 10mg of `foxy' at about 8:40pm, thinking it might be lessened by tolerance since I took 6mg just 2 days ago.  At 8:52 i could already start to feel a body buzz.  By 9:00 I was going pretty good, about as good as the 6mg 2 days ago.



Around 9:15-9:25 (I'm not sure exactly) we got out a joint, and I took a few hits off that.  Whoa!!!!  It kicked in FAST, I was seeing patterns and colors everywhere, and the person I was with was talking about something, but I was almost `gone'.  I went to sit on the porch outside, and everything I looked at was a mess!  Trails were so strong that they would just mush into tons of little circles and wierd shapes and stay there.  No words can describe it.



I went back inside, still not at the peak, but while I was sitting inside, I felt like I was slipping `out of it', where I didnt know what was real and what was not.  I was seeing sound, hearing light, smelling light, feeling sound!  Everything was a jumbled mess, yet fun!



I could somehow still hold a conversation with the other person, who didnt know how much I was tripping.   I was thinking i better tell this person that if I just stop talking and go nuts to just leave me alone, cause I felt like I was going to just lay on the bed and leave the world!  I was right on that `edge', of going away, then coming back, all my senses would tear apart, vision was all messed up, then come back barely so I knew where I was again.



I was extremely sensitive to every little thing that people that came in the room would do.  If they looked at me wierd I would get a big fear sensation, but then it would go away. After about an hour or two (I am not exactly sure), I came down a tiny bit, to where I had a better grip on reality, so I had the guts to go outside, and go for a walk.  Everywhere I looked there was very strong patterns on everything.  The sidewalk had these designs carved into it, making wierd shapes.  It reminded me of the last shroom experience I had, only way stronger.



I had less of a `body high' now, my mind was mostly clear, I still had the little bits of `lost reality' stuff going on for split seconds then I would come back.  I came back, and sat around the house playing with a laser pointer, talking to people, etc.  I was still tripping HARD til about 3AM!  Hard as i mean MASSIVE visuals, everyone's face was made up of some kind of textured shapes, all connected together.  Everything I looked at, random dots on a wall, all were connected together in some way.  I finally tried to sleep at about 3:30, I was yawning, even though I still had these massive patterns on everything.  I couldn't get to sleep for at least an hour, but I finally did.



5-MEO-DIPT can be a full blown psychedelic!  I never expected this with the dosage I took.  I wouldn't want to take any higher dose than this!  I'm not sure what it would be like to be `stuck' over that edge into total loss of reality, it was scary, yet fun, being right on that edge and coming back.  This blew any past LSD/shroom trip i've ever had away.
