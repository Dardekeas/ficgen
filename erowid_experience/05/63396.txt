We took the 2C-B first, waited for it to kick in. My boyfriend's kicked in after 45 minutes, mine took 2 hours. I had a little diarrhea, nothing uncomfortable, during the wait for the come up. 



Once it kicked in, I had nice visuals and a slight body high. We decided to smoke some meth. We estimate a bowl's worth to be 100mg, but that is an estimated amount. (10 bowls per gram = 100 mg per bowl.) 



I felt up and alert like usual with meth, but also had the body high and the visuals of the trip. My brain felt a little bit spacey and I got awfully smiley. However, I didn't feel incapacitated like I do on LSD or mushrooms. My boyfriend went through a period of about 2 hours where he felt incapacitated, almost overwhelmed. 



Come down was easy. We smoked more meth as the night went on, and the visuals just slowly dissipated. All in all I would recommend this combination.
