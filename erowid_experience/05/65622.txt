 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#   I got home, and assured my friend I would be alright and he left.



The visuals at this point were very intense, and my mind would get lost in strange thoughts that would be triggered by memories and seeing things. Shadows moved about on their own for no apparent reason, and things like blinds seemed like they were opening and closing on their own. I went and laid down on my bed. I felt like there was zero chance I could go to sleep. When I tried I would start getting intense close eyed hallucinations. At points, I would open my eyes and realize in complete astonishment that I was the only one in the room. Voices and characters would manifest themselves in my mind. Everything was very strange. 



I tried listening to music, I had it on random, a wide, yet very selective bunch of music appealed to my mind, I listened to Pink Floyd for the first time in my life, Brain damage, Shine on you Crazy Diamond, and Comfortably Numb were perhaps some of the greatest songs I had ever heard in my life. Some of the other songs that particularly amazed my mind, were Sweet Dreams are made of This (Annie Lennox), Everything in its right place (Radiohead), and the end of the song Yummy, by Gwen Stefani (It was on random).  For the rest of the night I altered between, intense closed eyed hallucinations, listening to music, watching select scenes from X-Men 3 and just thinking about how crazy this all was. Eventually I think I fell into a dreamless sleep for about an hour out of what seemed like extreme mental and physical exhaustion.



The whole next day I felt really different, yet very pleased and generally great. Nothing was rippling or anything anymore. For the next 2 months the whole world felt extremely nice, and I couldn't have been happier, I have never felt like that before. My other friends that had taken it felt a lot different after their trips a couple said that they felt more separated from the world for a while. It was all very intense, and I felt like maybe the LSD we got was different somehow, more powerful than regular LSD. 



I knew I would do it again after that night, just because I had felt so great at some points, and at very select times, I felt like I was getting giant waves of euphoria, triggered by a thought, realization, or music. That was another thing, it felt like I would get waves of visuals, sometimes, I would get psychedelic trails, then I would get wavy effects, then shadows would go crazy, then it would seem like I was looking through a screen or seeing two images of the world overlapping each other.

 

At this point, I still thought it was LSD, and went on to have other trips thinking it was LSD again.
