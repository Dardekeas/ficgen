I am 32 and have long been interested and using psychotropics / power plants. In the autumn of 1993, I picked about 100 amanita caps and dried them out over a warm radiator. My friend and I made a curry and when it was about 2 minutes from being cooked we added the pieces of 9 amanita heads which, before drying, were about 8 - 10 inches diameter.



The hit took about an hour to come on. I had been using psilocybes in doses of 100 - 1000 for several years and I knew that the high would be different. It was, in away, milder than psilocybes\ldots less wild and definitely more controllable. It was, I suppose, a bit like an hallucinogenic `slide-show'. I find that when I have a full-blown psilocybe hallucination, i get first a rush then BAM whatever I am seeing is just `there' and I am totally caught up in it. But with amanita, it was more gentle\ldots there were several `true' hallucinations, (by this i mean that I saw something that was not there, as opposed to mistaking(or tripping) an object into something which it is not\ldots like a tree becoming a man or whatever). Thats what I mean by like a slideshow..there was no rush with the hallucination.



Walking was kind of strange: It seemed that a destination took ages to get nearer. But there were no `colours' or `tracers' of light. Music did not seem to take on any extra properties, as it does for me with psilocybe and acid.  It was, all round, a good experience; one which I undertook many times after that.



BUT, later that night, I felt a weight in my gut\ldots .I didnt feel sick, but I knew I was going to be because of this kind of dead-weight in my belly. I went to the lavatory, and projectile vomited right into the pan (good shot, eh). There was no retching or the crap that one gets when puking after too many beers. I just puked, lol. This mushroom CAN kill, btw. YES IT CAN matey. But, like many other plants and fungi, it can also teach :-)
