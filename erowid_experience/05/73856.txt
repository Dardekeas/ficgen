 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:ACETAMINOPHEN\#\#  



I am a regular user of opiates. my opiate of choice is morphine. I have been unable to dose for the past three weeks. I went through withdrawal (for myself this includes 24 hours of deep sleep, followed by 72 hours or so of moderate depression).



Recently, I obtained twelve pills of acetaminophen with codeine 300/30 milligram tablets. I am not very experienced with this medicine, and did a bit of research, for I know that an excess of acetaminophen can cause health problems. I decided to ingest half of the, pills 1800/180 milligrams, to begin, and read to not ingest more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen within a 24 hour period, so I thought it best to not take them all at once.



I ingested the pills with a cup of fine green tea, and proceeded to watch a Democracy Now broadcast online. Within 30 minutes, I felt a familiar, yet different sensation of opiates in my system. After twenty minutes or so, the medicine began to show its contrast from the morphine that I am used to; The euphoria seemed to be centered more in my head than in my chest, and my neck was very itchy. I still felt the usual contentness, but this was soon followed by a mild anxiety spell, which lasted about an hour. From then on, most sensations of euphoria, itchiness, and anxiety had subsided into a pleasant, tranquil state. I relaxed for an hour, then decided to eat the remaining six tablets and take a cruise on my skateboard, as it was a calm, quiet evening. I downed the remaining tabs with another cup of tea and set out into the cool night. I returned home, not more than 20 minutes after I set out, feeling exhausted and nauseated. This worried me, as I am nocturnal and naturally energenic.



As I sat in my easy chair, I began to believe that consuming this medication was not such an enlightened choice, and perhaps I should have been satisfied with the first six tabs. I also had trouble urinating later that evening. In conclusion, I did not like the overall effect of this medication. Perhaps I took too much. I never have ill effects from my usual dose of morphine (30 to 60 depending on tolerance), and am questioning if this is a result of slight acetaminophen poisoning.



I wanted to follow up by saying that I spent the earlier portion of this day quite nauseated and vomiting. Purity is important with opiates, and I knew this before I ingested them, but my junkie instincts told me to do it anyway. I paid the price.
