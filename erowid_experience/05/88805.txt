Well, dont know much to tell, but i just sudden got a huge urge to go to outherspace.



So i'm sitting infront of my computer. I opened my little box with stuff and took out the oxynorm, 2c-c and xanax. 



I opened the two oxynorm capsules and poured the 40mgs into cigarettepaper and swallowed. Then i poured 40-50mg of 2c-c onto my mousepad and snorted it. DAMN THE PAIN!!! Dont know the exact dose cause one capsule had 40mg and the other one had just a little left from the last time i took some of it. 



It didnt take long before all imaginabale and unimaginable coulours appeared. But it was not stressful, nor frightening. Just beautiful. I felt so alive, happy and euporic. 



Then the oxynorm kicked in and i decided to go and lie down in bed. Swallowed four 1mg xanax and just laid there for hours seeing all sorts of coulours and not feeling my body at all. The `high' is the best i ever experienced. 



U know when they have for example filmed new york at night, then fastforeward the film so that u see all the carlights etc just flow down the road. It was kinda like that, but undescribable. 



Eventually i just fell asleep and when i woke up i felt a bit groggy from the xanax and the oxynorms. 



Great experience, but im a bit worried that all the chems and drugs i've taken over the years has destroyed/impared my ability to learn mathematics etc, because i'm gonna take som classes again.
