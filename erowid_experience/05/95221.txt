Note: Both people mentioned are small, average weight women, mid-late 20s. Neither of us had eaten in at least 6 hours. The author has a disrupted sleep pattern, having gotten $>$16 hours sleep in past 36 hours. The author also has moderate HPPD.



Previous drug experience for author: 2c-e, 2c-p, 2c-c, 2c-i, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, DMT, psilocybin, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine.



Previous drug experience for author's friend: 2c-e, AMT, LSD, psilocybin, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, ketamine.



0:00 Friend and I each consume $\sim$20 mg (first measured with a cheap scale, eyed-out after that) of 6-APB powder in capsules. Starting low to determine threshold.



0:15 Perception is slighty different. Friend feels slightly euphoric, while I do not.



0:45 We both consume another $\sim$25 mg. Notice a very strong chemical smell/taste, despite it being in capsules.



0:50 Friend has alcoholic drink, I have Red Bull and water.



1:00 Music does not seem to be enhanced by substance, nor mood. It seems to just be a `little extra something,' very mild. No tactile sensations. Things are sparkling in a way that reminds me of 2c-x substances, most distinctly 2c-c.



2:00 I make the decision to drive us home, because friend has to be awake early the next day. I've consumed no alcohol. Friend has consumed $\sim$3 drinks.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



Friend consumes another $\sim$50 mg. Music seems to be slightly enhanced. No tactile sensations.



2:15 Friend describes what she is feeling as `the strongest roll I've ever had in my life, if I didn't know for sure this wasn't MDMA, that's what I would think it is.' She mentions mild nausea, which could possibly be attributed to being in the car.



3:00 We return home. I consume $\sim$30 mg. 



4:00 Out of nowhere, I go from feeling almost nothing to the most incredibly loved-up sensation I can imagine. Tactile sensations are moderately euphoric. Eye-wiggles present. My heart is beating at a high rate, but not uncomfortably so. Exactly as my friend had described, I feel as if I have taken MDMA, plus the mild-to-moderate visuals. Only slight disturbance in thought patterns, which may be attributed to being extremely overtired.



6:30 Feel myself starting to come down. No crash. Very slight headache, slight gastrointestinal discomfort. No nausea.



7:30 Euphoria is completely gone. Slight visuals (less noticeable than before) remain; seems to be an enhancement of my pre-existing HPPD.



Friend feels very achy and nauseous, is unable to sleep.



8:00 Able to fall asleep quickly and comfortably.



12:00 Wake up. Very tired, visuals still lingering. No `crash' feeling, no depression, no afterglow.



All in all, I am incredibly impressed by this substance. After reading other reports, I had not expected nearly such a pleasant experience.  Very enjoyable entactogen, less stimulating than MDMA.
