It was a rainy day 

I had a headache



This

I have to say makes for an interesting tale of facets, of euphoria, of wellbeing and of love.



I had commitments last night, I had promised a friend that I would go to his gallery opening\ldots I had also however just received a curiousity, the methylone.

I was never really one for social event such as gallery openings

For those who don't know, it generally an ordeal for those who don't enjoy small talk, wine and large groups of insecure people gathered in one space.

However this night I decided I would try the methylone

I hadn't eaten anything for a number of hours so had pretty much an empty stomach.

I don't have scales

So I worked old school

Dividing the yellowy powder with a card,

Tipping it into a glass of water

A little stir

It tastes slightly bitter

But not unpleasant

The time now is about 7.10pm

I am on the phone to my `friend' with whom I will join later

I tell him that I am drinking this stuff

I finish the phone call 

I feel clearer

Its now 7.20

my headache has pretty much gone

it normally take me a while to get out the house

but I was on the bus by 7.30

and the bus journey was nice

I felt great

And clear headed

With no feelings of paranoia

I didn't worry about the other people on the bus 

I am listening to music, it sounds good, but it is good. A DJ set from Berlin. It just enhances my good mood.  Im tapping my feet a little but I don't feel like I want to burst into dance!

I get there and `there' at about 8pm

I felt as free as a bird

I flitted around talking to many people, those I knew, those I didn't.

I felt as though I was full of positive confidence, the kind which is not full of ego. 

Everyone is drinking, I don't want to drink. I don't really like it anyway. 

I have nice conversations, very caring. Conversations flow easily with everybody, even those that I don't like. Again there is no paranoia which I might feel on E or mdma. My mind is clear. I am able for the rest of the night to deal with all kinds of social situations which I may have otherwise found challenging.

I clocked my `friend' 

Lets call him MP

Of course as many faceted as the world is I could not just go up and speak to him.

Oh no\ldots for tonight, in this setting anyway, we were to play a little game.

For no one was to know that we really knew eachother \ldots yes, its true artists are a bunch of no good scoundrels!

Exchanging glances every so often, I began to feel that enhanced sex drive similar to mdma but with out the confusion.

I floated around looking at the artwork

I didn't feel the forced need to mingle 

It came very naturally 

I was very comfortable in the space.

Speaking is easy, with only one notable minor drug sounding,slur!

An hour went by 

9pm ish

I felt the need to smoke more than usual, as I don't smoke cigarettes much anymore

But, as with many drugs\ldots

I enjoyed heart felt conversations with friends.

Eventually after much circulating

We decided it was time to leave\ldots MP and I

We went out separate ways

Meeting at the bus stop

Yes!

Now it was time to go to the circus!

Yes, literally.

We happen to live in a city which once a year, for one month only, experiences its population more than double, and this toy town comes to life with music, cabaret, theatre, dance etc.

Approaching 10pm

We kiss 

It feels great

Well it always feels great 

But the methylone in my brain and the previous situation of sexual tension makes this kiss explosive.

We go to a bar

I am totally loved up 

Again not like mdma really, you see I don't like mdma too much as it makes me feel a bit confused and paranoid, its like on mdma my feelings are not true. They are just chemical. 

With Methylone I felt I could let my guard down completely, and let the drug take its course. I see now why its sometimes called Ease.

I ask MP if he would like to join me `down pleasant street'

We order juice and tonic water

I dose his drink with about the same amount as me

It is 10.20pm

I am still flying

I feel fantastic

Again within 10 minutes MP has joined me

And we cant keep our hands of one another

Small rushes of euphoria come in waves, remaining just at the right level to remain tucked within the inner self.

We talk about how we feel 

Truly and honestly 

And its beautiful

There is no false e-talk here

10.50 we head off to the circus

it is still raining heavily

and when we get there the que is long

we continue kissing under our umbrella

needless to say\ldots we are both very much hedonists!

The que isn't too bad, I decide to drop a very small about of acid.

Small as I don't want to override the methylone first time round, small also because we are going to the circus, and really there isn't need to enhance the experience too much!

The acid came on quickly. Although at this small dose gave me that slight headache and feeling in the top of the mouth sensation. 

The performance was great, twas Le Clique in fact

I love that sort of thing anyway, I really enjoy this time of year here, as people like MP and I are always this way, and for this month many others come into town, other performers and new friends. I feel really happy in this new environment

I am even starting to get a little full of myself

I begin playing up to the circus/cabaret vibe, I am also wearing my soviet generals outfit\ldots one of them. This is normal for me though!

We both enjoy the acts

MP I can tell is feeling that `increased sex drive' I mentioned earlier

We go out at half time 

And enjoy cigarettes and dirty dancing in the rain.

When we leave the circus it is about 2am

The rain looked beautiful on the ground

We wished we could go home

But in our situation this was no possible 

We had to eventually go our separate ways

However horny we were!

A taxi home

A kiss goodnight



I am home

It is nearly 3am

I go into my room

I think im tripping

As to my surprise I see a shape in my bed

There is someone asleep in there!

I deal with the situation

Its one of the lost boys of never EVER land

I am surprised at my cool ability to deal with the situation

He is promptly evicted 



I decide to have a joint

Unexpected OEVs!

Controlable though, nothing too heavy.

I shut my eyes

In a bid to hope that sleep will come

I hear the sounds of rain outside becoming distorted 

Intense CEVs!

Woah

I had no idea! 

These CEVs were where I saw the really synergy between the acid and the methylone

They had the slight dark side of acid, with similar colours. However the bliss was there which carried me through nicely into dreams of utopia with MP.



In all this was a very pleasant experience 

Better than I had expected

There is only one thing I worry about 

And that is, I would be tempted to use this chemical more often for events such as openings and the like.



I awoke early

Typically feeling as though I never slept

I feel great though

A little tierd

But full of positive energy 



I hope MP feels this good
