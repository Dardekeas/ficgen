I began becoming interested in drugs the year I reached high school, my favorites being alcohol, weed, and DXM. For a 14 year old me, there was no bigger thrill than being slightly drunk or stoned at school.



That year I became really depressed (drug related?), and my stress-related insomnia also began acting up. My doctor recommended me melatonin, not wanting me to become dependent on a prescription sleep aid. This did wonders for my insomnia and allowed me to have lucid dreams, making me less irritable and boosted my overall happiness.



One night I began wondering what it would be like to take melatonin at school, and the next day at school before lunch, I took a 3mg tablet.



30 minutes later I was getting drowsy. However, after waiting another hour, I felt nothing except the extreme drowsiness. I spent the rest of the school day in a haze. When I got home, I slept until the next morning.



I still use melatonin to this day, but never again I will take it for `fun'. It should only be used for jet lag and insomnia.
