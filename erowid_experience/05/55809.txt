 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# 



I had began using DXM when a fellow student in a trade school with me told me about it. The first time I tried it, we got called back to my job (it's 24/7), and I was beginning to think that the shit didn't work. All of a sudden it just hit me. I've been a believer ever since.



On this particular night, I was drinking with some employees from work, and I thought, what could make this night better. The answer was obvious. DXM. I went to my local store and purchased some Coricidin (Cough and Cold of course) and popped all sixteen of them. I drank about a fifth of Jack with the boys (a fifth is what I took total to myself, hey I got a problem). I got really messed up. I am prone to blackouts when I drink (hey, I said I had a problem) so I blacked out alot of it. Apparently, a neighbor saw me stumbling down the street (is there any other way?) and decided it would be a good idea to take me to the hospital against my protest. 



While I was in the hospital, they asked me what happenned. I remember most of the rest of the night. I told them that I took 16 Coricidins and drank on it. They asked me if I was trying to kill myself, because I took all those pills. I kept telling them I took them because I wanted to get high. They eventually got a urine sample, I'm guessing to make sure I wasn't on some other drug that I was lying about. They then released me from the hospital.



I later got the drug results in the mail and I was negative on everything they tested for (including opiads) except for alcohol, which apparently they can test for on a drug test. This just goes to show, it is possible to pass a standard drug test on DXM.
