I have taken a speed Drug called Adderall many times before but only 10-20mg every 2-3 days. I noticed that I had a pretty high tolerance and soon only got the `focused/fun feeling' yet very mild. So waited about 2 weeks and then upped the dosage. This time I took 30mg and it was one of the most Wonderful Bad experiences I've ever had.



1:34pm-4th period- I have 3 in my pocket. When class ends I run to the bathroom take a piss and pop those 3 little sweet blue pills. 10 minutes later I begin to feel the upcoming effects (Note: my body digests food incredibly quickly, and I have Hypoglycemia). I get that focused fun feeling and start flirting with my bitches =J. 20 minutes later I'm in my 5th period class in chorus. I notice that my heart is beating incredibly fast so I get some water. It gets worse. I sit down for a few minutes but decide to join the crowd and have some fun (today the teacher was handing out papers to see if some people made all state so she was stuck in her office). I play around but heart keeps getting worse and its been around 40 minutes since I took the pill. The teacher comes out and talks to the class, and has her and the class sing happy birthday to a girl in the class. I get up and get another drink of water, when I got up I felt extremely light headed like I just held the two veins in my neck and everything gets all wavy, I get the water and sit back down. It didn't help.



The bell rings and the teacher calls me up with some kid who made All State Chorus. She said that she's disappointed because I am the best male singer she has every seen and wishes I join all state, I reply with `hey can I sit down I really don't feel good'. `I just used my inhaler and my heart is beating pretty fast'( I didn't use my inhaler). she said `i know what you mean, my heart gets around 180 when I use mine'. I replied saying I have Hypoglycemia and she said she did to. she calmed me down. I had her write me a late slip and I went off to band.



As I walk outa the room EXTREME EUPHORIA like OMG I feel like I'm on coke yet not the I can take over the world feeling. my heart starts to beat again but I have some control over it and I really don't mind it. I get to band and sit down to start playing but I wait about 5 minutes cuz my heart is going fast and I cant hold my instrument. I still have that wavy vision and am extremely Happy. I go through the rest of the band period with ease. 



My overall saying is. `If you have never tried Adderall, It is a very fun drug if you use it wisely. I have noticed its kinda addictive, but I'm able to pick coke up and set it back down, and I cant seem to get addicted to cigarettes (yay). So be careful, no matter how good it'll make you feel, I recommend `shit use it at school round middle of day so your crashing while going home'. Yeah only bad thing about Adderall is the crash. It sucks, royally. But what I found out will help it 50\% is take a Vitamin B50 around 5-6 hours before you take it. You won't come down so hard and the crash lasts about 6 minutes. Keep em Lit'
