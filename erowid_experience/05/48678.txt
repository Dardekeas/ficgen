The other night, I decided to try out a ``Red Heart'' pill that I ordered from New Zealand. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the pamphlet said a safe alternative to extacy, so I went in to it hoping that I would have a great experience.



Well, I certainly didn't expect as much as I received! My Mum and I took 1 pill each at 7.45 pm. The pills were slow to act; about 1 hour, as apposed to about half an hour for an E. The Red Heart also came on less dramatically. I didn't get a rush of the drug entering my system. Rather, it was a slow gradual increase in the intensity.



About an hour after we took the pill, Mum suggested we have a few cones. It was Mum's gear and I hadn't tried it before. So, I had a couple of cones and passed the bong on to Mum. I stepped back and looked at her and said ``wow, that's good pot Mum\ldots\ldots. It really good pot!'' That's when Mum said ``are you sure it's the pot, and not the pill?'' I realised at that point that these Red Hearts were really awesome!



The sensations that I felt were similar to extacy, but a bit different. The Red Hearts seemed to connect me with my intuition and subconscious on an unbelievable level. Every moment was filled with life-changing realisations about life, and everything in between that you could ever imagine. I understood things so deeply, it was amazing! 



Time stood still. These Red Hearts had me pumping, I had limitless energy, motivation and interest in everything. I felt like I didn't have a single need for anything. Being thirsty wasn't unpleasant; my 3 inch heels didn't hurt my feet, even after wearing them for hours and hours. 



I felt loving and warm and comfortable within my self, my surroundings and in other people. I had to stop and remind myself that it wasn't extacy that I took, it was a red heart. As with extacy, I had an intensification of my senses, and WOW could I dance!!!



My internal dialogue was (in hindsight) hilarious! If anyone knew what I was thinking, they would have thought I was so up myself. I had an intense feeling of purpose and ability. I became intensely interested in being the best person I could be; intelligent, attractive and an all round nice person. I realised that the character of Reece Witherspoon in Legally Blonde 1 and 2 was my idol. I wanted to be just like Eve! 



I had a dramatically heightened sense of appreciation in every sense of the word. In fact, a lot of things that I said started with ``I have a heightened sense of understanding other people's needs'' or ``I have a heightened sense of acceptance'' or ``I have a heightened sense of self-awareness''. Every perception was heightened, and I couldn't stop saying it!!!!



And the best thing is that Mum was in the same frame of mind, and everything I said to her was so interesting, so we never had a dull moment. The worst thing was that I had to get up early because it was my son's 6th birthday the next morning, and I had to do the present thing and put on a little party. At 3.30 am, I was still pumped, and wanting to party. But, I just couldn't sleep (even when I thought I was sleeping, my thoughts didn't stop, so I don't know if I actually slept at all, or if it was a case of having intense thoughts during my sleep), I was majorly bummed out energy wise all day.



On the subject of negative side effects: I had way less adverse reactions from the Red Hearts, except I still clenched my jaw terribly (although grinding wasn't a problem). I didn't have the emotional low that I have had after taking an E, and I'm sure if I was able to sleep the next day, that I would have bounced back faster.



Overall, I think that Red Hearts are definitely worth the money. For me, they are a suitable substitute for extacy. They are not exactly the same as extacy, but I feel that if my body copes better with the side effects of the red hearts, that the extra bit of edge you get from extacy isn't worth it, if I suffer so much more with the comedown.



By the way, I've already ordered more\ldots\ldots. NEW YEARS EVE\ldots\ldots\ldots here I come!!!!!
