I recently bought a lb of wild dagga leaves from a well known vendor. I was looking for a cannabis like high that they promise. I tried smoking the leaves but they were horrible tasting like molasses and rubber. Smoking the leaves didn't give me any effects, except a gross green dagga phlem, and a sore throat.



So I decided that I would put the leaves in a bowl and let them soak for a day. I strained the leaves out and boiled the water down till it was resin/tar on the bottom of the pan. I was excited, and was looking forward to a buzz. I smoke cigarettes daily, and had smoked cannabis (4 hits) about 3 hours prior to trying out my dagga resin. I was in a positive mood and upbeat about the experience to come. I had sampled dagga resin from an online vendor before and liked the experience. So I anticipated a nice high. 



I collected all the sticky resin and ended up with about 5 or 6 grams. I packed about 2 to 3 bowls of this dagga resin (about a gram each) and smoked it with my girlfriend `Daisy'. It seemed to come on very slow, every thing seemed a little off-kilter, I was watching tv and everything seemed stranger than normal reality. About 20 minutes after smoking a strong sedation started taking effect. 10 minutes later I felt dizzy and my stomach was starting to be upset. I tried falling asleep, but I was so nauseated I couldn't, I started getting chills although I was under a heavy blanket. I jumped in a hot shower, I felt very disorientated, and couldn't focus on anything. I attempted sleep a second time, and every thing I thought about made me sick to my stomach literally. Every thought made me want to puke. Well I puked about an hour and a half after the initial smoking. 



This was definitely not fun, not recreational and not something I ever wanted to experience again. I never want to hear the word dagga again. The following morning I felt almost normal, and the first thing I did was throw the resin away. 



I do not know what caused this horrible reaction. Maybe it was the large amount I smoked. Maybe it was how I prepared it. Maybe it was the amount of tar that my lungs endured. What I do know is that it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.
