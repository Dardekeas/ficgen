I first tried Mephedrone several months back, while the local MDMA supply was low. It came in several jiffy bags, but what was apparent was that even inside all these, the envelope stunk of it.



The first thing to hit me once I opened it, was just the sheer smell of it, far stronger than that of Amphetamine, and my initial thoughts were that I was never going to rail it. Boy was I wrong. The smell of it is really like ammonia, a really really strong chemical smell that you can't forget.



My first experience was bombing 150mg, and I was planning on staying in for the night to listen to music, etc. About 30 minutes after bombing it however, the sparkle and euphoria I normally get from MDMA was all around, and I decided to go hit a club, on my own.



After some 2 hours crazy out-of-character dancing, and crazy sociability, I came down really suddenly, and went back home, with a crazy desire to keep topping up. Effects wise, fairly euphoric, made me talk a lot, was stupidly horny, sweated A LOT - but I do that anyway on most stims, full of energy, and really loved music.



Compared to MDMA, similar euphoria (when bombed), far more hornyness, a bit less empathy, no psychadelia (although light tends to prism after several redoses, I think this is just a serotonin effect) - but what was amazing is that the next day, I felt brilliant, like I hadn't done anything the previous night. I would also compare it to speed and coke a little in its stimulating effects, which were far more than MDMA on its own.



After a couple of fun nights like this, I decided to try railing it, having really enjoyed the bombed effects. I set up a good 100mg line (the lines of this stuff are huge, and the stuff is awful to snort), and prepared to snort it in. As I got about half way along the line, the pain was so much that I had to stop. I literally staggered back, nose burning and eyes watering, and quickly went to the toilet, looking for tissue to blow it out into. Suddenly, the burning sensation turned from pain to extreme euphoria, and I had to sit down hands over head and literally call out loud, `WHAT THE FUCK'. Within about 30 seconds of snorting it, I was much higher than I had ever been before, from experiences with pure MDMA, coke, a few research chems like Methylone. I bit my tongue within the first minute, I started gurning so fast.



The euphoria was absolutely crazy. I looked in the mirror, my eyes were saucers. I felt giddy from how amazing I felt. Stroking my arm was like having an orgasm. It was about as mindblowing as my first `e'.



The crazyness was the pain to pleasure of it. It goes from being the most awful sharp pain, smelling like stinking piss, to the best I have ever felt, in about 30 seconds.



And I stay like that, for about 2/3 hours, and then suddenly come down, whack. The next day, I'm fine, but the sudden comedown of it is astounding. One moment I'm peaking quite high, then suddenly, its like someone turns the light off, and I have a desire to redose. When I redose, I get about 3/4 of the initial rush the first redose, 1/2 the next, 1/4 the next and nothing after that. I get a little more of a comedown the more I redose, and if I redose to the end, I feel quite bad at the end of the night but can't get to sleep. The next day is always fine however.



The stuff is dangerous in how much I can fiend it though. I can plan to just have a little line, and as soon as I get that first rush, I chase it all night trying to get that feeling back. 



Every time snorted still feels like my first `e' though, every breath I take is like it's my first.



I prefer it to `e' as it has all the good effects, and minus the next day's hangover. Its brilliant especially for raving. However, the main downside, is how bad it tastes and smells, and how bad it is for my sinuses. I would compare snorting it to being kicked in the face by a horse. The drip is worse than the worst tasting food I can think of. But the strength of effects from snorting it are so ridiculously strong, its totally 100\% worth it.
