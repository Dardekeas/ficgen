I got ahold of 60 2mg generic alprazolam.  I am 105 lbs (48kg) and a very experienced drug user.



I took a 2mg bar in the evening, noticed some interesting color enhacements on the blinds in my apartment, and the next thing I knew I woke up 14 hours later.  According to my lover, I sat down on my bed, and within 15 minutes I was snoring.  I was still drowsy when I woke up.  I had to drink a lot of coffee.



Three or four days later my lover and I each took a 2mg bar at the end of an MDMA roll.  It made me feel extremely uninhibited (though I feel I am generally open), but very zombified.  We had wild sex for about an hour and a half; my lover remembers none of it.  I remember what we did and in what order, but have no real connection to the experience.  Somewhere in the middle of it I told my lover to stop doing what he was doing at that particular moment, and he either took this to mean `no more sex' in general and fell asleep, or he just fell asleep in the middle of having sex.  I fell asleep, woke up feeling like a zombie.  Not an especially bad feeling--just completely moodless and chemically blank.  Boring.  My lover hated it, talked all day about how much the Xanax had fucked him up.



I know there's an immediate recreational tolerance.  The next day I took 1mg in two .5mg doses and felt the vaguest hint of the zombie blankness, but virtually no other effect.



Then I got really sick and started using 2-8mg a day to calm my symptoms.  It worked great for that, because my usual remedy is pot, but I had (and have) this massively swollen throat prohibiting smoking, and making brownies, etc., a pain in the ass to swallow.  The Xanax actually made me feel much better than smoking dope while sick ever has.  I still stayed in bed and rested, but I felt a lot more normal.



During the higher doses I've taken throughout my sick state (a 6mg day right after a 2mg day produced marked recreational effects), it made me feel clumsy, which I guess was a little fun--it's sort of fun to collapse on my soft bed after stumbling around the room spilling my thermos and stuff--but, I mean, it's not THAT fun.



One day when I woke up feeling really, really sick, I took 1mg and my lover took me for a drive and played me a mixtape.  For about 30 minutes, I got pleasant visual and aural enhancements, but they were pretty minor.  It was more fun because my lover took me out and played me a mixtape than it was from the drugs.



I've combined Xanax several times with Soma (carisoprodol).  This enhances the muscle-relaxing effect and makes me drowsy.



All in all, Xanax has helped me a lot through being sick, but recreationally, my opinion is that it is a very boring drug.  I am hoping to get some Valium soon; I took a lot of it in high school and remember having a lot more fun.
