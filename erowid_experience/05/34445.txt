 Last night I had a hellish experience with iv 2c-t-21.

 

 A little background: I had been suffering minor methadone withdrawals all day, but had been softening the discomfort by taking 2 mg clonazepam once in the morning and one about 6:00 pm.



By about 7 pm I was suffering withdrawals to an uncomfortable degree despite the clonazepam. I intended on getting some much needed cannabis, but then my disease reared its ugly head and before I knew it I had scored and fixed some heroin. I felt ok if a little spacey from the clonazepam. In retrospect I was much more intoxicated than I felt I was at the time. For some reason I can not fathom, I injected 4 mg 2c-t-21 iv. BIG MISTAKE. I immediately felt like I had injected some terrible toxin. I was vomiting terribly, but it did nothing to alleviate the horrid nausea and poisoned feeling. Surprisingly I felt no fear, indeed my emotions seemed to have been turned off. I was very confused and felt drugged, like a wierd sort of drunkeness or an anti-psychotic zombie type feeling.



 I couldn't decide what to do, so I drove to a nearby freinds house on deserted back roads. By this time the nausea and toxic feelings were fading, but I still felt very confused and drugged. There were absolutely no visuals or sensory effects, and I was able to drive surprisingly well.



 Upon arriving at friends house I took a hit of cannabis and started to clear. Amazingly it had been over 2 hrs since injection though it felt like 20 min. It took a couple more hrs to repair. At no time did I notice any real psychedelic effects. Now that I was finally mending, I drove home, fixed some heroin and immediately fell asleep for about 10 hrs.



 This experience is in stark contrast to my recent iv 2c-c experiment, in which 20 mg produced incredible visuals, and though i did vomit, I did not get any of the confusion and severe toxic feeling that I got from 21. This was almost certainly my last iv phenethylamine experiment. Some day I may iv DMT or DPT or something of that nature, but 2c's I will only do orally from now on.
