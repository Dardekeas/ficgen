Ok, I ordered a fluid ounce of wormwood extract from an ethnobotanical company. The bottle was marked with poison symbols, which made me a bit apprehensive. I read somewhere that the proper proportions to make the fabled Absinthe was 1 cup of Pernod to 1 teaspoon of wormwood. I didn't feel like buying Pernod, so I cracked open the wormwood bottle and added a teaspoon to a cup of Absolut vodka. The wormwood was very dark and had a very strong odor, kinda minty but with a distinctive edge to it. The oil was very hard to wash off the spoon, it stained it green, and the spoon smelled like wormwood for a while. This worried me, considering I planned to pour it down my esophagus.



I mixed it vigorously, covered the cup in Saran wrap, and placed it in a refrigerator for two days. After the wait, I stirred it up and strained it through a rag, removing a resiny layer that had separated from the mixture. The resultant mixture was a cloudy green, it looked a little like bong water, and smelled even worse. The white plastic spoon I used to mix it was colored green, and wouldn't wash easily. I was getting apprehensive about the stuff, and the smell was making me queasy.



I mixed a shot of the mixture with lots of water and sugar. It did not turn opaque white, as I read it should. Summing my courage, I started drinking the 16 oz concoction. It had a strong taste much like the smell of wormwood, and made my stomach very queasy. Every sip I took made me gag and make sour faces. I don't know if my reaction was psychological because I was afraid of the stuff, or if I just didn't like the taste, or if the stuff really was bad for me and my body was complaining. I put red Kool-Aid crystals in it to make it more palatable, but it didn't help. I gave up after a quarter of the cup.



I think I got a buzz off it, there was a drone in my head and I felt like I was on painkillers, but I think I need to drink more. I ate alot of food and drank water afterwards, but the horrible taste was hard to get out of my mouth, I think it coated my alimentary canal like it did the spoon. This thought was not pleasant.



I think I am going to just try and down a shot of the wormwood and vodka without diluting it, and hope I don't vomit it out. That will take some courage, though.



Does anyone have any experience with this, did I do anything wrong? Any suggestions or dire warnings? If I don't get any negative feedback, I'm just gonna down the shot and hope for the best, and then post the results.



I'm open to ideas and suggestions. Wish me luck!
