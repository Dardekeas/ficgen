I have tried various substances, including many opiates, so when the chance to try suboxone came up, naturally I accepted. I took home the little orange pill and broke it into four equal pieces. Each about two milligrams. I took one piece and it tasted like chemical oranges, nasty, but hey, they're trying. 



About 45 Minutes later I felt that odd sensation that comes with a rising opiate high, the feeling that everything is slowing down. I continued to watch tv. About 20 Minutes later, I realized I was in for a ride. I recall getting up and being suprised at how strong it was. I had set up a comfy spot to lay down on so I laid down and closed my eyes. After laying for a while, I realized I needed to be in the dark, as the light was somewhat irritating. I shut off the lamp, layed down and played some bob marley. I felt warm and fuzzy, and as though I was floating off the bed. I kept telling myself that I couldnt fall asleep, sounds faded in and out. I eventually did get to sleep once I let my guard down. The next morning I felt sick, I immediately ran out of bed and to the bathroom and threw up, the rest of the day I felt somewhat tipsy. I only have one thing to say for someone trying suboxone or a similar med. BE CAREFUL!! it is strong. Only take small amounts, unless of course you are told otherwise by your doctor (if its being perscribed).
