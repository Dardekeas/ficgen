I have had a very frustrating time getting my Chinahuasca to work in the past, as I try to be extremely cautious especially dealing with particular chemicals like MAOIs. I have slowly gauged the appropriate dose, as the last thing I need is a hypertensive crisis and trip to the ER. This has left me a bit disheartened, and thinking that Acacia just doesn't work as I used 50+ grams of Caapi with the Acacia and only had a sense of content wellbeing. This led me to biting off more than I could chew. I started with a bit more than 50 grams of 4x extract Caapi, did 3 pulls in a crock pot with vinegar and 2 liters of water each time, and reduced the 6 liters down to 8 oz. Next, I brewed the Acacia. Same as with the Caapi, except I used 100 grams, and ended up with just over 6 oz at the end. The following is how the night transpired.

T-0:15 Discussed with sitter what I was doing, and to keep me calm. We relaxed together as I tried to clear my mind, I was in a very good mood and she was very sweet to me. She was complimenting me and just being genuinely nice as we talked which put me in a very good state of mind.

T+0:00 Ingested 2 oz of Caapi brew(just over 50 grams). The taste was bad, but not as bad as I knew the Acacia would be. A movie was put on to help pass the time as we continued to talk.

T+0:30 Ingested another 2 oz of Caapi. Started getting a very light feeling, along with general happiness and wellbeing.

T+0:45 Ingested 2 oz of Acacia brew(about 30 grams). I could tell the Caapi was definitely kicking in, however, my stomach was now waging war against me and what I had put into it.

T+1:30 I was very happy as I noticed it was working, and quite well. I saw that objects had begun to send ripples through the air from their edges, like rocks being thrown into a pond. My sense of time was greatly distorted, and I had a sense of euphoria wash over me.

T+1:45 Quite intense now, as I looked at my sitter, she had what almost looked like transluscent multicolored face paint on that disappeared when I blinked and reformed.

T+2:00 I was doing ok, but had to lay down. Everything began to get drowned out streaks of light and pattern as if I was traveling incredibly fast. I felt as though I was going blind. I also found myself apologizing to my sitter, saying I was sorry for doing this to her as it was not fair and messed up. I also said I need to not do this anymore, to stop messing with entheogens, ethnobotanicals, and hallucinogens.

T+2:15 After I layed down I began to dry heave, and then stopped. This was the peak of the trip, I had lost almost all ability to see anything around me. I began to panic a little bit as I thought to myself `What if I took too much' `What if this will never end' and `why did I do this to myself'. I tried to not lose my sanity as I tried to reconnect with reality as I could barely think coherent thoughts.

T+2:30 I managed to calm myself through a form of meditative focus, and this is where the trip completely turned around, and morphed into something beautiful. I felt as though I was bathed in warming light, that somewhat numbed things to the touch. I still had difficulty seeing, but coherent thought patterns returned. I began focusing on my life and humanity. How I should believe in myself and lay my insecurities to rest. I also thought of a eutopian society, and how we could all coexist peacefully. I wanted to track down the world leaders and explain to them to lay their differences aside, and focus on the progress of humanity by working together. I wanted to go to North Korea and liberate it's people, show them they don't have to live that way and they have the power to reject their oppressive government. I heard the voices of all those who believed in me and had said such kind words of how big of a heart I had and how smart I was. I then thought to myself `why do I reject this and not believe these people, it's more than modesty, but a self defeating/self loathing'. I felt a renewed drive to educate myself, build up a reputation, and make a difference in this world. To follow my ambitions with ferocious dedication. I just wanted everyone in the world to get along, and care for each other.

T+3:30 I have come down substantially, still seeing patterns and rippling effects, but I could function. Normal thought patterns have returned.

T+7:00 All effects have subsided.

All in all, a very healing experience. I Have suffered from anxiety and severe depression for more than a decade. I stopped taking my medication months ago as it only made things worse. This experience has helped me re-assess my frame of mind, thought patterns, and especially my lack of self-confidence and self-esteem. At one point was very intense, almost too much to handle, but I kept calm and enjoyed it very much. Take care, and be careful. Know your dose, and more importantly, know yourself.
