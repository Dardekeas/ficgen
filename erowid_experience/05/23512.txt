As an experienced psychonaut, I am not a virgin to psychedelics or to most other drugs for that matter. After having around 500+ separate journeys with LSD, I still never tire of each unique and wonderful experience. Now, around this part of the country, drugs like meth are easily accessible for anyone with a half a mind to find them, but getting some good dose has become almost next to impossible these days. For this reason, I began to experiment around with a few alternative psychedelics, one of them being H.B. Woodrose seeds.



Now, I had tried Woodrose seeds before, ranging anywhere from 2 to 50 seeds, and had very little success with them. I never felt anything more than some nausea, fatigue, and a tease of what I wanted. Regardless, one weekend I decided to give them yet another shot, and my girl and I each tried 10 seeds while we happened to be up on some pretty good gogo. The seeds where first scraped with a razor to remove any fuzz, crushed, soaked in 4oz of distilled water for one hour, strained through a coffee filter, and then taken orally around 8:00pm. 



Also, please allow me to clarify; I probably use far less methamphetamine then that of most users. Any habitual or daily use might go through a gram in about 2 weeks between two people, with the average `bump' about 5mg in size. I believe in moderation and have sensitivity to stimulants; moreover, I really just want to express that taking massive amounts of speed isn't required to receive positive results.



The typical upset stomach set in about 30 minutes after ingestion, my girl spent the next 20 min paying homage to the porcelain god. I have found that if I don't move, watch a movie, and just sit still for those first couple of hours, that I can avoid losing my stomach while the initial symptoms pass.



About 3 hours into our trip, we noticed a remarkable difference from the times before. Everything was more intense with vibrant hues of orange, deep lines of blue, and very similar to that of an LSD trip. Yet unlike LSD, all hints of paranoia and suspicion were completely absent. My mind was that of a majestic oak, soaring high in a luscious valley, completely surrounded by every natural element in perfect harmony. 



She and I spoke of many things, about feelings and emotions, and not about the overly psychoanalytic brainteasers of your typical acid trip. This time, we were completely relaxed in both mind and body, yet had this incredible energy that could be felt strongly emanating from the both of us.



Some 10 hours passed, of which we primarily spent in the bedroom. With daylight streaming in and birds chirping loudly outside our window, we decided to rest for a while. Sleep came easy and about 4 hours passed, at which time we got up feeling well rested, very happy, slightly hungry, and still tripping just a little.



After a mild breakfast at about 2:30 in the afternoon, and I say mild because no tweaker wants to eat anything after staying up all night, we did a small line and then smoked another equal amount in a glass bowl. Immediately after I exhaled my hit, everything around me began to swirl and undulate. Colors rushed back into the room, floral designs on the wallpaper started to grow, and I could hardly believe my eyes.



What I thought was going to be a 3 or 4-hour event turned out to be a 3-day long spiritual journey like I had never experienced before in all of my life. If I where to just sleep a little and not do any more meth, it would go right away; otherwise, the effects lingered on for an indefinite amount of time.



Now, the visuals were never quite as strong as LSD, but came very very close on the first night. After that evening, they were still there but almost transparent if your attention or focus was elsewhere; however, as soon as you looked for them, they would begin to move and shift around just to let you know that the world was alive and smiling with you. The residual feeling of well-being and strong sense of self lasted well over a month; in fact, I can feel it still.



I realize this post has become rather lengthy, so I'll wrap it up. Now, since I'm only an under-grad chem student, I have neither the knowledge nor experience to adequately explain why the LSA seemed to increase in peak and duration simply by using a little methamphetamine. All I know do is that it seems to work as a catalyst, made for a very beautiful and healing experience, and was just lot of damn fun.



So, I hope this information helps someone else have experiences that are as good or better than my own. But please, know your limits, know your environment, and bee safe!
