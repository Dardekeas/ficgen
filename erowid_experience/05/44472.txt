I got my hands of 4 10mg Cyclobenzaprine pills. I heard that snorting them burned but what the hell I'll snort anything, so I gave it a shot and it didn't burn at first, but after I got both of them down holy shit did it ever burn it was like when I have a really bad cold and it doesn't stop burning. 



It felt like that for about 45 mins it was pretty annoying but once it was gone that's when I really got to enjoy the high I felt very tired. I was at peace. I lay down on the floor and cranked up the music (a nice Mo `Thug What Love is' was the most amazing song for this Experience) and looked at the white ceiling. I felt so warm and alive like life had a meaning, and I suppose after about half and hour of pondering the mysteries of the universe, I turned the music off made my way to my room and slept for a good 13 hours before waking up with no ill effects. 



I felt more energy from the amazing sleep I had. Well, overall it was a very nice experience it was a little bit like pot but not that much.
