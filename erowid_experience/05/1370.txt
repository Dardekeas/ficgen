I recently received a prescription for tylenol 3's from a walk-in clinic without even asking for them or even complaining of pain.  I guess the doctor knew how much fun they can be and decided to share the wealth.  Since I was not in any pain I chose to use the drug recreationally.  The first time I took a dosage of 3 pills @ 30mg each (not 100\% sure but I think I recall seeing that on the prescription) I felt quite relaxed and did not experience any ill side effects.  A few days later I decided to try a larger dose.  So I bumped the dose up to 5 pills or 150 mg.  I sat back, relaxed and started a movie.  After 1/2 hour or so I felt quite alert mentally but at the same time exremly relaxed and happy.  After 2.5 hours I was still pretty high.  As far as the withdrawl goes I did not feel down at all.  In fact quite the contrary, the next day I felt extremly euphoric.  Whether that was a side effect of the drug or just one of those good days will remain to be seen after trying this more.  As with any drug one must test out their limits and keep the usage in check or it will no longer be as much fun, but used in moderation I'd say it is a damn fun drug!!
