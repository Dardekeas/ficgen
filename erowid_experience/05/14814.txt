I read many reports on the internet, so I ordered 28 grams so I could determine proper dosage. It took over a month for the package to arrive. 



I had this hunch last night that they would arrive today. Sure enough the box arrived after I woke up, but right before my 5 pm shift. I ate nothing, drank only caffinated liquids and smoked cigarettes to block hunger. It was very hard as being a line-cook. 



I got home and took out 1 very large cap and broke another in half. I  roughly guestimated about 7-9 grams at first dose. I immediately felt the dried fungus activating some enregy in me, similar to my experiences with psilocybin. About 90 minutes later, I felt a real speedy acid-like jitter. My mind was flying, I felt very powerful and a little wild. My friend made a surprise visit and I he couldn't tell how my trip began to peak. 



About 2 1/2 hours the `heady' buzz got stronger. I felt no nausea at all. I ate some chips and salsa. I tripped harder. The body rush was like that of MDMA. I felt like I was on cloud 9. I watched `Zero Effect' and almost fell asleep. Slight visuals were everywhere as if I was on the verge of crossing into another world, but couldn't. 



I ate another 2-3 grams to see if I would trip harder. It's been 5 hours and I am still tripping hard. I still feel no sickness. If the trip keeps this good I may do this more often. I will add more if something different happens. This reminds me a lot of ecstasy \& acid. Like one big candy flip. Wave after wave of almost rolling/ tripping. Very clean as well.
