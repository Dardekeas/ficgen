I recieved my first 100mg of 5-meO-dmt from good chem lab today. I had never tried 5-meo or dmt before but used to trip alot on lsd with the dead back in the 80's \& have taken large doses of ecstasy. Nothing could have prepared me for this though. 



I attempted to cut 100mg 5 ways \& futher eyeball to strong enough dose(15-20mg) which may have proved my end.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# 



First time was good.I smoked over a tiny bit of weed in a small pipe.Rush was instant at exhale, I put the pipe on the floor \& had the feeling of `oh no what did you just do'. I was looking at pictures on the wall of a trance festival I attended in morocco years ago with my wife.The pictures came to life.I dont mean just moving around or melting like acid but they played as if they were movies.Then I noticed my cat(\& this is trippy)is staring me down \& looking freaked.I have to try not to see him as a demon.He starts running around \& trying to attack me, senses the energy \& is afraid.Was proof to me that I was really in another dimension. Anyway I try to calm him down \& this eats up most of my trip(30minutes), unfortunately. 



So \# 2- hour after first, cat in the other room.Approx same dose, not exact but couldn't have been more than 15mg. I have music(1200 mics)perfect to bring me in.This time same intense rush, moment of regret \& instant hallucinations. I concentrate directly at these same photos as they come to life again.I am struck with a remarkable feeling that I am reliving the experience \& embrace it. Somehow through the music I am feeling connected to a cosmic energy \& I see people at this festival dancing.I feel connected to them,like taking acid with alot of people at a concert.All of a sudden I have the feeling that I am there, It is real \& I get scared a little.Start to think I went to far, but I am able to tell myself to just go with it,even say this out loud, I think.



I had a profound feeling of taping into a never ending, always present world of trips \& music.I am convinced now the this place is real \& exists for sure.I was not always sure on acid \& that was more of an internal thing for me.This was in your face different dimension.



LAST ONE$>$ came down \& waited another hour.For my next experiment I decided to take a hit(larger dose maybe 20mg)\& go outside to sit on the porch.I took a huge hit, all I could take \& went out sat down \& exhaled.INSTANTLY as before I launched.I noticed right away everything changed.Everything alive like acid,geometric patterns.Very strong.I feel my body change as if transforming into this `new' world \& things got BAD.First I noticed the sky change,everything around me is swirling \& shifting \& becomes uncomfortable.I hear strange noises \& one becomes louder \& louder as if coming closer$>$it was a `large' mechanical sound\& humming. 



I really feel like I am coming fully into this other dimension,It gets weird.I hear music in the distance, though I'm not playing any now.I look down at my arms \& have the sensation I'm being pulled in to it.I get up \& go inside \& right away I know somethings really wrong.All of a sudden I am sure I went to far \& I'm not going to come back.My computers on \& it starts going crazy \& flashing through my files as if deleting them.I look at some photos on the wall \& they seem to be erasing.I look at a clock \& it's racing backwards out of control \& it hits me like a ton of bricks I'm DYING.



I have the unmistakable feeling that I'm dying \& my life is being erased.I'm going no,no this can't be happening, yet I'm convinced it is.I feel like I've reached a purgatory,gone insane\& It's going to be my fate to wander the house in panic.I think about my wife \& family \& how they will react to my death.I completely lost it. I grabbed the phone to call 911 but didn't.Still had the Idea of being gone \& stuck in the void,felt really evil.At this point I'm down on my knees pleading to be taken back.It gets more intense \& I'm sure I'm done for,I was terrified\ldots completely.



I pleaded \& begged God to take me back.That I had to go back, please,please.Then just at it's most intense, it starts to leave, slowly at first \& it takes awhile before I'm certain, I may be coming out of it.I'm totally shattered,laying on the floor saying THANK YOU GOD over\&over.Now, I'm not that religious but I felt a power different than the void \& I could feel it helping me back to sanity.This was not a good trip \& I have decided to flush the rest \& stick to weed for now.



To anyone planning to use this drug at any dose,should use extreme caution.5-meO-dmt can bring me to a place I don't want to be in.As far as I'm concerned these other places are very real,they exist in the universe \& I can be trapped \& not return\ldots \ldots \ldots
