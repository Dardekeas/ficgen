I have used Mate' de Coca on many occasions as an antidepressant.  



When used as a tea, it is a pleasant, gentle stimulant until one far exceeds the 1 bag per 50 pounds of body weight.  Adding Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda) seems to help the tea steep much faster.



I'd noticed that Coca-Cola used bicarb in it's process, and the Inca used Lime (a slightly different alkaline), so I decided on baking soda as a readily available catalyst(?).  



Again, as a tea in low doses, it is much better than coffee.  It DOES wear off in several hours as coffee does, leaving one a little tired. 



A couple of years ago, for portability, I decided to fold a teabag, add a pinch of baking soda, and put it in the side of my mouth like chewing tobacco.  1 bag seemed to be a safe alternative to a cup of tea.  For some reason, maybe a bad day, I decided to try one bag in each cheek.  That seemed to bring the stimulation to an `abusive' level.  It reminded me of Cocaine, and started the associated `can't get enough' feeling.  



Soon it was 3 bags, then 4, which was all I could fit in my mouth. The sensation was like being CONTINUALLY on a cocaine high.  As long as the bags were in my mouth, it was like that sensation I get from first snorting cocaine, but it STAYED as long as the bags were in my mouth!!  I had a mess of soda and a pile of bags, but the end of day feeling when I stopped convinced me to stop chewing and take a break from the stuff.

   

When one crosses the threshold from use to abuse with Mate' de Coca, it becomes strongly psychologically addictive due to the pleasurable sensation, but when I stop, there's a commensurate great sadness and fatigue. A mild addiction and TERRIBLE nights.  Toxicity becomes an issue with higher doses also.
