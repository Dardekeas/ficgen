\end{tabular}

\vspace{2mm}
Age: 18

Ht: 5'8

Mental status: anorexia, depressed, occasionally suicidal. Also hardly any drugs work good with me eg. weed makes me cry and makes me thoughts attack me. I never smoke weed cus I hate how it affects me.



Overall place taking pill: in a music festival

Taking pill with: guy I just met who I now consider a friend



Place pill was taken: walking towards a place to sit to have a drink (water) and chat with friends.

Aprox. Time: 10:30pm

Body just before taking pill: hungry-starvation, just stopped crying.

Mind just before taking pill: mildly depressed, excited.

Thought example just before taking pill: `hopefully this will make me feel happy I mean it's only half a tablet so I should be sweet\ldots I hope this wont make me freak out.'



Place as pill began: sitting down with friends

Aprox. Time: 10:45pm

Body as pill began: relaxed a small bit

Mind as pill began: very very happy, falling in love with people around me though still at a normalish level (eg.I was scared of a few drunk people as I would have been sober), nothing else affected  at all.

Thought example as pill began: `gosh I love rammstein sooooo much'



Place at climax: watching the mars volta with a friend

Aprox. Time: 11pm-11: 30pm

Body at climax: legs couldn't help me stand up much, really tired, wanted to lean on people in the crowd

Mind at climax: I was in loooooove with everyone and I had never been that happy in my whole life, the glow stick I held seemed to be like god or something and the band to me were so amazing!! The music to me was the best I had ever heard. At first it was all exciting but eventually it toned down at the climax into a sort of floating where the only way I can describe it is like being the song `just like heaven' by the cure (yes I'm a goth) if you have ever heard it you will have some idea.

Thought example at climax: 

`You

Soft and only

You

Lost and lonely

You

Just like heaven'



Place at come down: sitting watching a band with my friend and exiting the concert

Aprox time: 11: 45pm-12: 30pm

Body at time of come down: eyesight had trouble going from looking far away to looking up close (eg. Looking at the stage then looking at my mate beside me). Wanting to vomit, small headache, big-ish pupils but not too bad, pale face (but that's kinda normal)

Mind at time of come down: head drifting in and out of soberness, not able to show my freaking-outness properly, like my insides was scared and swaying from `I'm ok' to `I'm sick' yet my body looked totally fine and I was acting normal. It may sound very scary but at the same time I was very happy which helped calm me down*. I just wanted to escape the concert but I was very astute and even bossy to my friend as to the fact that I wanted to leave.



Thought example at come down: `stupid drugs playing with my head, luckily my friends are here, I want to vomit ick!, but come on it's just the crowd and lack of food, when you get home you can have a good sleep'

*really I think it was the starvation and crowd that freaked me out. 



Feeling sick/hangover?: in car on way home and at home

Aprox. Time: 1am-10am the next day

Body at hangover: really really wanted to vomit, couldn't eat anything!

Mind at hangover: still feeling very happy and in love. General good mood and pleasant thoughts/memories

Thought example: `man I loved that concert and I love the cure\ldots I love my mum and I cant wait until I see my friends again'



All in all=8.5/10 

(1 being the lowest)
