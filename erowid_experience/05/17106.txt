Was a normal party in my area. Included the usual alcohol and marijuana, some prescription pills as well. But not for my brother and I. Not tonight. Tonight was my brothers 1st experience with the most wonderful drug in the world: Ecstasy. It was my 6th time. But tonight, I was taking two.



One roll had always made my night for usually 5 hours, at 9:30 I took my first while driving to the party, my brother directly after. He caught a taste of the chemicle and grimaced at it. I had warned him about that. 35 minutes later I took my second as instructed by my dealer (and good friend). another 20 passed and neither my brother or I were feeling anything. He became impatient and I told him, `Don't worry about it, be happy and embrace what is comming to you.' 



I then sprang up and declared that I needed to put strings on my glowsticks before I lost the coordination to do so. We went to my car and on my last knot, I felt a sudden rush of warmpth and a good tingle for about 10 seconds, I smiled and told my brother, `I'm starting to feel it'. About one minute after the initial feeling I turned on a house mix by Tall Paul and then a huge spike of intense euphoria rang throughout my body. My eyes immediatly picked up on lights, my sence of touch sang in my hair down to my feet. Suddenly, the world was right. What a perfect night. I walked to my car hood. Two very good friends of mine (girls) and my brother sat there, my brother with a most plesant grin. 



`I'm felling it,' he said. I, rushing fast to my peak, took his hand and sqeezed it, giving him a large hug after that. His smile grew and he continued to sit and enjoy the heat from my car engine. 



I travled about a foot to the girls, smiling, eyes half shut. They asked how I was doing and I replyed, `I'm loving it.' They both smiled and looked at me in a very deep way. I could suddenly feel all of the love in their eyes and smiles and I then realized just how lucky I was to know them and to be so close to them. But I had to connect more. I found myself kissing one of them. That one kiss made me feel so involved, so graciously rewarded, and I suddenly felt such a closeness I have felt with no one before. Not in love, but completly secure in our relationship. I then went and kissed the other girl, feeling the same rewards and more. They both are so precious to me. 



Someone dropped a can. The ping of the can shot through my ears and in my head. A new sensation I had never had before. I stood up and told the girls that i was going to sit in the back of my car and listen to music. When I was in there, the subs began to work their magic on my body, the Bass had become so profoundly deep and soothing. The highs crystal clear and sharp. The music wasn't even loud at all, I could clearly hear everyone around my car, random conversations would be forced into my head. popping in and out at my will, as if everyone had their own volume control. The girls the came into my car on either side of me, began running fingers and nails over my head, arms, and chest. All of this stimulant pushed me into outerspace. Peace and tranquility consumed me.



A Dreamstate, prehaps. Everyone careless and floating around. Nothing was wrong and thats how it would stay. I was touching Heaven, and it was all around me.



I got out of my car, craving more energetic activities. I Grabbed my glowsticks and turned up some hard/progressive house and started to feel the beat.



The most wonderful thing about music is one's understanding of it. I write electronic music and spin as a DJ. Music has always mooved me in ways I have loved and appreciated. Now, glowsticks in hand, the music flowed through me like and I began to get Nasty with my toys. A flush of people attracted by the mesmerising patterns came over, I just danced harder. It seemed the music was moving me, as I made little effort to do what was happening. Tears came to my eyes, I felt the power, i felt the emotion, and i felt the groove. People applauded me and danced around my psychadelic reel. I jumped and shouted joy. Someone stopped me, gave me water and sat me down on my hood. It was breaktime again. 



Another friend came to me, looked at me and said, `You're rolling face,' with a smile. I looked at him, giggled and appreciated the observation. He gave me a light show and left, leaving me in a complete trace. 



MY BROTHER! 

Where was he!? I sprang up to find him and when I did, gave him a most deserved hug. He hugged back hard and long. We stopped and looked at each other a bit. We then went for a walk, talking of `back in the day,' our childhood. We brought up the fondest of memories that we both had though we lost, we shared laughter at these and then talked about subjects that hit closer to the heart. All the hard times and negative thoughts came out in our talk. And in the deepest of understanding and compassion, we resolved all the conflicts. Another hug was born and we, for the first time in 18 years, declared our love as a family and as friends. We realized that night that we would not be the same people that we are today without one another. With new peace, we walked separate and enjoyed the rest of the night.



On my way out of the party, I looked at the sky. I couldnt stop. Never had such a sight caught me. a spiral of clouds I was overwhelmed. the texture of the clouds so full and rich with depth. the stars outside of them glistening lusterous beauty, It lifted me and has given me a greater appretiation of the world aound and above me. What a perfect night.



I woke up the next day at about 1pm. I felt so good and relaxed. I felt so accomplished. In the span of 4 hours I had done so much, and loved all of it. The new people I had met and the bond that i had made with the two girls and my brother. I truely had a good night. I sat on the lawn, appreciating everything aroud me. At peace, in Heaven, on Earth.
