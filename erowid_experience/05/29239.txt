Setting:  Home, with girlfriend.  Southern California, December 2003.



2:20 pm  40 mg IAP ingested, dissolved in vodka.  



After drinking our shot \& a half of vodka, my partner \& I sat down to smoke a couple of bowls of good cannabis.  We expected a slow come-up, from reading others' reports, and decided to take a bicycle ride to take our minds off waiting.



By approximately 3:15, I was feeling the first alert, which came on as a strange increase in pressure in my head, with colors becoming more pronounced.  



Upon riding our bicycles further, the strange nature of the compound began to be felt.  Though the compound is definitely `speedy,' there is a strange relaxed feeling one gets, it seems as though time is slowed slightly, and one is moving in slow motion.  A very nice mood came over both me and my companion, and we continued riding in spite of feeling a bit cold (it was a windy, overcast day).  



We both felt a slight oddness in our stomachs, but ignored it by smoking a small amount more of cannabis, about 1.5 hours after coming up.  My girlfriend enjoyed the 2 substances together, but I found myself uninterested in smoking (which is *strange* for this pothead!), and declined to smoke more than a single toke.



We headed home after about 2 hours out and about, and got back home around 5:00.  I was chilled to the bone, moreso than I would have been under normal circumstances, and felt the need to curl up in front of a heater with a blanket wrapped around me.  My girlfriend did not feel the intense chill that I did, and I remembered that I also get similar chills when eating magic mushrooms, while my girlfriend does not.  



The peak of the experience lasted about three hours, and consisted of a pronounced amphetamine push, we both felt lots of energy pent up inside, however, I had no problem simply sitting still in front of the heater, soaking up the warmth.  In fact, after about 4.5 - 5 hours, I began to feel intensely relaxed, even yawning several times.  My partner felt the need to keep busy, playing a video game, looking thru a newspaper advertisement, practicing with a typing program, smoking cannabis, making conversation, basically whatever was around as a distraction.  At this point (4 - 5 hours in), we started to have stomach distress, with slight nausea, and unavoidable gas.



About 6 hours after coming up, we were still very much feeling the IAP, and decided to venture outside again, this time skateboarding to a headshop to pick up some Whip-Its.



My girlfriend tried the nitrous as soon as we got back home, and quite enjoyed it.  The laughing gas lived up to its nick-name, and my girlfriend had fun doing balloons while watching COPS on TV, she said she found the situations hilarious.



Shortly after a few balloons were consumed, fast food was obtained, and while my appetite was considerably diminished, I did my best to eat something.



About 8 hours after coming up, we were still feeling the IAP, but in an annoying way, we both felt a number had been done on our GI tracts, and had diarrhea that night and the next day.  I also developed a minor headache, which felt vascular-related, as it throbbed in time with my pulse.  I began to find it easy to close my eyes and `zone out' around this time, and did so as much as possible.  



Around midnight, 10 hours after dosing, we both drifted off to a fitful sleep.  Neither of us could seem to stay asleep more than an hour or so, and the next morning we felt like we could *still* feel the last 10\% of the effects.



We both agree that the experience was agreeable as far as research chemicals go, but can't be used as a substitute for MDMA, and is not something worth repeating.
