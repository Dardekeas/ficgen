I have been smoking on and off now for the past 6 years, but deep inside I will always be a smoker. I honestly wish I had never started, but no matter how hard I try the cigarettes always pull me back.



It all started when I was 12 and I was offered a drag by one of my close friends. I coughed a little and my lungs didn't feel to special, but I went back for more. I did this because I was curious as to what was so good about it, why so many people did it, addiction was the furthest thing from my mind.



Over the years I have gone from smoking 2 or 3 cigs a day to a pack, sometimes more depending on my stress level, whether or not I'm going to a party, or where I am. Different situations prompt different levels of desire for a cig.



It has been an on and off battle for me, I have had some successes, but none really because I am back where I started and I'm smoking more than ever. I'm only 18 now and I'm scared that if I don't quit soon I could be up to 2 packs a day within the next 6 years.



2 packs a day and only 24 years old? God I hope not.



I wish I had never started, but now it seems so hard. I've been smoking for so long that it's hard for me to find a place where I don't have the urge to light up. I want to quit so badly, but I always end up back where I started.



I regret every cigarette I smoke, and every dollar I've wasted on them, but I continue to smoke and I continue to waste.
