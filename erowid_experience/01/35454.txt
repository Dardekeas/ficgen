Ended up being a very odd and wonderful ride.



8:00 I dosed the 2C-I\ldots  I'm told it was between 30-40 mgs. (yes I know thats a big difference but he and I both lack super accurate scales) took it on my tongue and a sip of water\ldots  Wasnt too bad tasting at all because there is so little of it to take. (which is a plus in my book)\ldots . It should be noted that I had eaten dinner at 5:45. Had not had any alcohol in a week or so, and was fairly stoned.



8:15- start feeling the jitters\ldots  Tingly and going all throughout my body. Like through all my nerve endings\ldots  Sorta pulsingly. I found this odd because my last and only 2C-I experience had been on between 15-20 mgs and I had been sorta drunk before taking, and I really hadn't felt any of this energy and tingles this quickly at all. I started to get excited! It seemed like this was going to be quite the ride.



8:30- Oh I'm definitely feeling it at this point\ldots  Full energy is pulsing through me. At a vibrational rate\ldots  And constant\ldots  Going down each nerve from base to tip it felt. I'm also starting to get some odd CEV's at this point\ldots  Mostly spiralish designs. Helixish in nature\ldots  Perhaps maybe they were dna strands. The previous 2C-I trip I had not had hardly any visuals at all. And then only at the tail end of the trip. 



I get up and walk around\ldots  And go into the room gmg is in and tell her how great I feel. That I have all this energy inside me\ldots  She just smiles and asks if I'm ok with it. And I smile and say yah\ldots  At this point I'm feeling sort of like I took a speedy roll (mdma) and its pretty damned good! 



8:45- Time has started to slow down considerably\ldots  The past 15 minutes seemed more like an hour\ldots  My perception is noting much more at a much quicker duration. I'm feeling EXTREMELY GOOD\ldots  But not as much like mdma\ldots  Sure my external body felt good being manipulated. (rubbing my neck and arms and legs and feet and etc\ldots ) But it was how it felt inside my skin in the muscles acting by itself was what felt the best! It was very reminiscent of riding the crest of an amped up lsd trip\ldots except with more energy. And feeling like I might just burst\ldots  Like if it keeps up too much\ldots  I might just not be able to handle it\ldots 



I immediately realize the bad thought loop trying to rudely interupt my good times\ldots  

I decide that I KNOW that I can handle a whole helluva lot. And typically am smiling ear to ear by the time I'm done\ldots  Its only when I freak out and worry about not being able to handle it that trauma and drama ever ensue. I smile and tell myself that I will ride this one out. That it will be fun and that I will learn from it! (that loop stopped right there)



Before I had done 2C-I the first time, I had asked voodoo what he thought of it. And he described it as gentle. My first trip I totally agreed. It was very enjoyable and controllable and just gentle\ldots  



This trip was not very gentle. It was like taking off strapped into a high powered firework. And having it about to blow up inside me\ldots  But feeling all the power and energy just crackling inside was a rush! I started to REALLY enjoy it\ldots  And couldnt believe how hard I was tripping out at just 45 mins since taking. I knew this would be a great trip! My grin started to get wider\ldots \ldots 



Visuals at this point are starting to take affect w/ open eyes to a lesser degree\ldots  The contrast of shadows and lines was much more in detail. My focus was both clearer in the center of my view and somewhat cloudy in the peripheral view. Objects that had lots of lines to them seems to swell and stretch a bit\ldots  Wallls breathed a lil bit. Very reminiscent of acid\ldots  Objects that were layered seem to move around on their own a little bit\ldots  Peoples eyes looked a bit off\ldots  Something about pupil to whiteness ratio\ldots  I'm not sure\ldots  CEV's at this point are fantastic\ldots  Multicolored hues of the strands are still forming ever more and more complex helixs\ldots  Sometimes I see what appear to be nebulas and stars in some strange cosmos\ldots  Lots of crazy ass mandalas. Fractal and geometric designs. It was really cool\ldots 



9:30- WOW This is a great drug! I cant believe I still havent peaked yet!\ldots  This is something else\ldots  I am watching a movie\ldots  And think I hear rain. But the movies volume is up. And suprisingly\ldots  It is raining\ldots  I had heard correctly. I decide to go outside to make sure our windows were rolled up and to cover up the grill\ldots . It felt pretty cool outside\ldots  All thes drops sending rippling energy vibrations all over my exposed skin\ldots  It enjoyed just standing there\ldots  But didnt want to get too soaked so I only stayed out there for a afew minutes\ldots  But it was beautiful. The sky was dark and hte moon was barely out\ldots  But I could see perfectly well. Everything seemed awash with the life that the water was bringing to us all.



I go back inside and go listen to some music and watch milkdrop\ldots  Put some good trance on (pvd live at radio sunshine) and sorta tripped out for a bit\ldots  Was fun. My visuals hadnt really progressed too much\ldots  At least oevs\ldots  Mostly distortion based\ldots  But seemed controllable\ldots  My cevs were still wonderful\ldots  Full of color. And sometimes whole scenes would come on\ldots  With like stages sometimes. And othertimes more galaxies. And interactions of all sorts of different lifeforms\ldots  Or entities. I dont know. They didnt talk to me\ldots  Or threaten me. Or appear to interact with me at all. But each other. And they would make lines making complex designs\ldots  Its hard to describe\ldots 



My energy level at this point is through the roof\ldots  But I'm sitting down\ldots  Its all in my mind \ldots  But my body is feeling crazy! A shimmer of doubt came and left as I just smiled and really started to think I had caught a great wave and that the ride was gonna be one to remember.



10:00- well I remember the last time I did some 2C-I\ldots  Sex was fantastic\ldots . So I started thinking about it\ldots . Only thing is. I had a LOT more mindfuck going on this time as compared to last. And didnt know if I would be able to concentrate enough\ldots  But eventually decide it would be fun and talk my mate into it\ldots  Skip the details. But I had my eyes closed the whole time. And seeing all these cevs that kept evolving and morphing made it pretty incredible\ldots  Almost like making love to a swirling cosmos writhing this way and that\ldots  With huge circles full of fractal based designs started wrapping around teh cosmos and it kept moving and as it moved the fractals morphed with it\ldots  



It was intense! I started seeing all sorts of hues of color change as the base for all the interactoins\ldots  Starting with dark woody colors and getting lighter and with more flare\ldots  Ending with this brilliant white light with all the other designs that were still going on contrasting in a green so dark it was almost black\ldots 



10:30- man that was great!! Even if a bit quick! It took almost all the focus I could gather just to participate!! I'm feeeling WONDERFUL!! I'm now fully charged and crackling with energy! I feel it go from my feet up to my head like a tesla coil over and over again! I decide a shower is in order! Left all the lights off and the door open for a bit of light\ldots . Shower felt good! Not as good as the last time tho\ldots  (last 2C-I experience. Which was alot more like mdma) 



Sat there for a good 10 minutes with a goofball smile on my face staring at the light fixture\ldots  Thinking how wonderful a job it was doing\ldots  Even technically it was taking a break (I had it off) and how I was grateful for it for being slack at the right time\ldots  And how this was backwards as I would feel in other situations\ldots  But fit just perfect here\ldots .



Go to 1:00- ok\ldots  Well I'm much more into an introspective mindset\ldots  I'm really thinking about things and meanings and reasonings and motivations and priorities and good and bad and yin and yang and all sortsa odd stuff\ldots . Sorta off into my own world for a little bit\ldots  And I start to get a bit sad as I reflect on how my current perception of the people of the area I live in. And people in the world in general and how my faith in basic goodness dimishes each day\ldots 



So. I hop onto mirc! Good place to get cheered up\ldots . I pack up the bowl\ldots  Get a couple hits in me. And enter the chatroom\ldots  Got some cool friends in there tonight\ldots  One who I was hoping to see, john! As I knew he had taken some mesc earlier. Sandra was in there was well and she had taken some mesc earlier as well\ldots  Talked with inquiring about life for some time. As well as mindy. Ralf too@! And clint and bee popped in at the end of the night! Lots of good friends to sit back and trip out with and just share great conversation and times with. I was smiling the majority of the evening\ldots  Kept packing the bowl\ldots  And really lost track of time. I love chatting with some of these people\ldots  Its just good fun. And its always fun to trip with other trippers. Even if just thru a computer monitor\ldots  I had a real blast!



But as 4 am rolled by\ldots  I decided. I wasnt going to sleep without anything to help me out\ldots  So I took the last of the xanax I had\ldots ..



45 mins I get off chat\ldots  Starting to feel a bit sluggish\ldots 



By 5:15 I am in la la land right up until 2:00 pm!



I had a GREAT time. Very good . Very intense . Very love filled trip\ldots 



I think this drug has a great potential for exploration in the future. Anyways. That was the trip\ldots . Not too much out there about 2C-I\ldots  Never done 2C-B but this was something else man\ldots . Very very good stuff!
