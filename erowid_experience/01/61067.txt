So I was pretty run down from drinking too much wine the night before and having a lack of sleep. After I put my son down I decided it was time to try LSA (Morning Glory Seeds). So I had 150 of them which I ground up and let sit in a jar of water for 2 days. So at 7:30 after I put my son down I drank and ate all the seeds. I felt a bit nauceus and decided It might be best to smoke some cannibis to smooth things out. 



Well I smoked that then at about 9:00 the onset was coming at full blast. I was really tired but couldn't sleep and I got really fidgety almost like a coke addict gets, I kept moving around and kicking and decided it might be best to take a bath as I was shivering and freezing cold. It was in the tub that I noticed my eyes were a big as a full moon. So I thought I better think of a deity or someone to channel to make this worth while. I thought well hey how cool would it be to call upon a goddess like Aphrodite or Eris.



After much discomfort and not being able to sit still or relax I got really sensual feeling, I had all my clothes off and was just wrything around in my bed. I was initially playing some Dead Voices on Air on the CD Player but that procedd to be FAR too dark, so I decided to listen to Download's `III' as that is my all time favorite record and the ethereal techno beats would sail me away. That's when she came to me I thought it was Eris but perhaps it was Aphrodite, and it was amazing she was EVERY beautiful woman, she kept changing her appearance.



I just kept having visions of a beautiful woman who would morph into another beautiful woman, she was every nationality and every color hair and look. So It was like I was making love to her and it was SOO sensual but I couldn't climax. I felt EXTREMLY sensual but alas despite all the images and get feelings I couldn't climax, I could almost get there but then just couldn't finish.



She said something to the effect of `I take it if I need it' If not I don't, and right now I don't.' I don't know what she meant, possibly an orgasm, but then afterwards she said, don't think you get all of this without some sort of lesson. 



So I said well what is my lesson and she said `Stop fucking around'!!! Stop all this constant experimentation and trying to figure out the universe and all it's secrets. She basically was telling me I was selfish and that my main priority is to be a father and a hero `To that little boy in the other room' and to learn that I am wrong it's not all about your own individual experience, it's about love and teaching. So that I was too filled with lust, lust for experience, women, recognition, adventure, etc.



That night it was black out sleep, not recalling anything after that, The next morning I was really shaking and felt upset. I felt especially close to my little boy and decided to go wake him up and play with him. After that I dropped him off at daycare, came back home and called in sick, as I felt drained and really needed to have the entire day to really reflect on what the hell happened to me and to work on my priorities.
