I helped a friend of mine get a medium quantity of 2c-b and in return he tipped me a couple of doses. I had tried 2cs before and found that I wasn't much of a fan, but I am not one to look a gift drug in the mouth. After he tested it and found it to be as advertised, I decided more or less on a whim to take a large dose one Sunday evening.



I had been dabbling in aniracetam (A common nootropic) for a couple of weeks, with a daily dose of 750mg being maintained for about a month. There wasn't much information about this combo on the internet, but after seeing my friend survive (he was regularly taking a comparable amount of aniracetam though a lower dose of 2C-B), I decided that I would take my chances. I weighed out 30mg, packed it into a gel-cap and swallowed it.



I was advised to listen to music and smoke weed on the 2C-B. `Music is key' I was told. After about 45 minutes I could definitely feel something coming on. After about 90 minutes after ingestion, I vaped a bowl and I immediately started to trip, complete with vague pulsating visuals, which quickly escalated in intensity until I could do little more than lay on my bedroom floor and `hold on'. I distinctly saw what appeared to be writing in the pattern of my popcorn ceiling and carpet, either some kind of ancient Greek or runic script. I found the experience to be more calming with the eyes closed even though the closed-eyed hallucinations were more intense. 



I plateaued  for six straight hours with the total duration of the trip lasting about eight. My friend reported the same when he took the chemical. A 2c-b trip is generally shorter (I've heard six hours with a plateau of about four) and I was not at all expecting what occurred. I kept compulsively vaping bowls throughout this experience. While they did little to affect the visuals or intensity, the herb managed to calm me somewhat. The calm only lasted briefly though, so I found myself vaping more and more as the night went on. I do not actually know how many bowls I went through. 



I would describe  the intensity of the trip as coming in waves. In previous times of popularity, 2c-b went by the street name `nexus'. This most accurately describes the feeling of the drug. I felt like I was at the dead center of the universe. Shulgin describes a `body conscious' aspect of it, which I can attest to. Thoughts of mine raced and spiraled out of control. They consumed me thoroughly then released me to be pulled in by others. I was completely alone for the duration of the experience, which was a mistake. 2c-b is known as a kind of club-drug, which is where its music appreciating effects and altered body perception would be best put to use. It is definitely as `tribal' as people say it is, so my taking it alone without any tribe doesn't make too much sense in hindsight.



When the experience was finally over I was more relieved than disappointed. I had too much pent-up energy after the trip and sleeping proved difficult. At the end of the day, it would not be inaccurate to call my experience a `bad trip'. I would not recommend higher dosages of 2c-b if you've never tried the chemical before. I would not recommend taking it with aniracetam if you do not want to be tripping for a very long time. After a certain point, I just got tired of being high out of my mind to the point where the hallucinations were simply banal and the trip became something to survive rather than something to enjoy.
