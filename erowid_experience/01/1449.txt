Let me start off by saying I love opiates, having smoked Opium, and used codeine, and Oxycodone before.  I stumbled upon a bottle of hydrocodone/acetaminophen prescription.  Per tablet 7.5mg of hydrocodone, and 750mg of acetaminophen.  I know aceta is hard on the liver in high doses, and its hard to get high on small amounts of prescription opiates, so I decided to use the same extraction method suggested in the codeine faq.  I knew this would work because all opiates dissolve well in cold water, where as aceta does not.  So I dissolved 7 tablets and filtered it. 



The solution was very bitter and almost horrid, but not nearly as bad as stomaching nutmeg!  Well, about 30 mins went by and I felt that familiar opiate buzz come on.  About 15 mins after this, I was feeling comfortably stoned\ldots the best opiate high I have ever experienced, including smoking synthesized opium.  The feeling resembles being very drunk at the same time as being warm all over, numb, and overcome by intense eupohoria.!

  Not a care in the world when high on opiates.  I watched TV and browsed the web.  I stayed high all night.  At times, I experienced nausea, but this goes away while lying down.  The next day, I awoke around 10:00AM.  I had taken the dope at about 10:00 PM the night before and fell asleep, still high as a kite, at 3:30AM.  I felt very sick to my stomach and vomited twice in the morning, which helps you feel better.  The nausea I experienced disappeared at about 1:00PM.  Nausea is expected after an intense opiate experience if one isn't a constant user\ldots this is because your body is withdrawing from the drug, which is why addiction occurs.  But I find that the nausea associated with opiates like hydrocodone, oxycodone, and codeine are very worth the intense high and stoned euphoria one recieves.  I can't wait for my next opportunity to get high from prescription opiates.  I wonder how much better heroin can really be.
