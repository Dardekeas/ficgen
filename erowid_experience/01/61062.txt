Well I was home from college and was bored looking for something to occupy my mind when I stumbled across a bottle of 60x 50 mg tablets of Ultram. From what I had read it seemed to be fairly week so I decided to go big on my first experience with the drug and take 5 pills. Whoa!



T+0:30 min- My vision is blurred significantly and I can feel my motor skills slowly fading away.



T+1:00- Wow I'm really starting to question if I should have taken as much as I did. Every 5 minutes are so I totally forget where I am and then all of a sudden I remember. Almost like taking to much X. I also have a quite euphoric body high, but the stomach ache seems to be countering the good feelings.



T+1:30- Finished vomiting for the first time I feel significantly better now, its almost like being in a dazed stupor after taking a lot of morphine. I find I can no longer play counterstrike source because I'm much to slowed down and I forget I'm playing every other match.



T+2:00- I'm purtty sure I've already peaked I can feel myself starting to even out. I went to the bathroom to vomit again\ldots if it wasn't for the vomiting I would have really enjoyed this drug.



T+3:00- I went to bed for about to hours woke up feeling quite refreshed and then I threw up all over the place, but after that the vomiting stopped and I felt purtty good throughout the day.



Retrospect- Overall a good experience I enjoyed everything but the vomiting which I think could have been avoided had I taken a lower dose.
