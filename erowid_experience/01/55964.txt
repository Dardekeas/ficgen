My friend and I had bought Salvia Divinorum 10X out of pure curiosity. How could a plant that was said to cause extreme hallucinations possibly be legal? Well we tried it out on a few different occasions, and nothing very interesting happened. I saw a few shapes and bright colors but I was looking for something else. 



About a month later I had invited a few friends over to the house I was watching for some family friends. They had an amazing pool and so we decided to take advantage of it. I had had about four or five beers that night when my friend, while was looking through my purse for cigarettes, happened upon the Salvia. He suggested doing it, I agreed. There were several things I should not have done in this situation: 1. I had been drinking, 2. I had not planned on doing salvia at all so I was not prepared, 3. I was nervous and paranoid because my parents were unaware of my little party.



We had a home-made bong out of a water bottle. It was about 10:30 on a warm summer night in July. We all sat in the pool shed, about a 6'X6' square room with a plywood floor and walls. This first hit was much more intense than any of my other experiences, but not what I was looking for either. After about three other friends took a hit it was back to me. I packed the bowl real full and filled the water bottle with thick smoke. The moment I pulled it away from my mouth I knew something was different.



I do not remember putting the bottle down or handing it to anyone. In fact, I had completely forgotten that I had smoked the Salvia at all. All of a sudden my life, everyone's life, everyone's complete existance turned into tiny fragments of life. I could see my friends, but it was as if we were pictures on a piece of cloth. We had lines through our bodies, but we could still move on the fabric. I heard someone say `Your parents found out'. This caused me to panic. Right then the fabric that was our lives started to be pulled away one by one revealing pure, white nothingness. God was doing this to me because my parents found out and were mad. Each line that was pulled away was slowly killing my friends and turning my world into complete non-existence.



As I tried to stop it I started to move through the lines, this was physically very painful. It felt as though my body had to be cut again and again each time I moved into another line. I started screaming for it to stop and that I was sorry. I was so sorry, I would never do this again if he would just make it stop! Please, he had to stop it! Im not ready to die right now! I still have my life to live, I can't die yet! I remember using the word: `Klepinger branger'. It was all part of the klepinger branger. I remember thinking `This is life, I messed up so now my friends and I die.' I literally felt as though this was the end of my life and there was nothing I could do to stop it.



My friends told me that the whole time I just had this complete look of terror on my face and talked in jibberish. The only part they could understand was `Make it stop'. They said it did not last more than five minutes. But to me, it lasted an eternity. When I came off of the Salvia, it took me a long time to realize what had just happened was not real. I broke down crying immediately, in fact, I think I started crying while I was still on the Salvia. It took me about two hours to calm down enough to drive home.



That experience was the most terrifying thing in my life. That day I promised myself I would never touch the stuff again. It scares the shit out of me. Now, about two months later, I have had time to think about things, and I would like to be able to enjoy the Salvia experience. I think that now I would like to try it again someday, not too near in the future, but sometime. I would definitely prepare for it differently, not be using any other substances at the time, or have any reason to cause me to worry. I have read about so many good things from Salvia that I would really like to be able to have that, but when or if I even do proceed in this area, I will tread with great caution and respect.
