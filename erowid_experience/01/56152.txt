I took half an ounce of the dried mushrooms via chewing them up and swallowing them. I also took a spoonful of ginger to relieve the nausea. They didn't taste bad, but weren't good either.



It has been 2 hours since I have taken them, and it feels like the effects I usually get with 5 shots of vodka, but at the same time completely different. I can think clearly, my balance isn't affected very much and I don't have drymouth. I actually have the opposite in that my sinsus are completely cleared up and not dried up. I have chronic sinus problems and they were dried up and runny the whole day.



I smoked a cigarette and then part of a cigar an hour and a half after taking them and threw up afterwards. Nicotine doesn't seem to mix well. I will definitely use these mushrooms again the next time I want to feel relaxed and ready for a good night's sleep.
