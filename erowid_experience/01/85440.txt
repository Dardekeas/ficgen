This was my second experience with mephedrone.  I don't have much more to say about it that I didn't say in my first experience report, mostly I am just writing this because I have not read any other reports of anybody trying to smoke mephedrone.



My friend and I each started off with a 250mg oral dose.  We have read about how compelling it is to redose, so she only brought over a little less than a gram for the two of us to split.  My friend mentioned the possibility of sprinkling it over weed to smoke it, but I suggested that since we don't know the melting point of this substance and don't know if it will vaporize or just burn, it my be more efficacious to smoke it in a way that involves an indirect flame.  There was a burned out light bulb in the ceiling fan in my kitchen, so we decided to do it up white trash style and hollow out that light bulb to use as a smoking device.  It isn't very classy, but it works.



We decided to try some, smoked, about two hours or so after we had ingested the initial oral dose.  I didn't measure the smoked doses, but I loaded the bulb five times through the course of the evening, and I know we had 300mg so probably about 60mg each time, which was plenty for each of us to take one big hit.



It melted fairly quickly and vaporized cleanly leaving very little residue behind.  The smoke was not nearly as harsh as I feared it might be.  I insufflated a little the first time I tried mephedrone, and the burn wasn't horrible, but it wasn't pleasant either, so I worried the smoke might be kind of harsh.  It actually tasted almost pleasant.  My friend commented that it was almost fragrant, reminiscent of laundry detergent maybe.  It was definitely chemical-y in nature still, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it could be.



The effects when smoked were about what I expected.  A pleasant rush hit almost immediately upon inhaling the smoke, lasted for about ten minutes, and then gave way to a pleasant stimulation.  When smoked, it seemed to be slightly more stimulating and not quite as euphoric.  I also noticed that my jaw really started clenching when we started smoking it.  I don't know if that was just because of the increased dosage, or if the route of administration actually makes a difference.  



We continued smoking, each taking a good sized hit every 30-45 minutes until we finished off the bag my friend had brought with her, so we probably smoked about 150mg each, in about 50mg doses every 30-45 minutes.  



The jaw clenching was worse this time than it was the first time I tried mephedrone, but the first time I only took 250mg, and this time I took about 400 (over the course of 5 hours or so).  I had a little trouble falling asleep, but it wasn't as bad as with say coke or nowhere near as bad as after meth.  Once I finally fell asleep, I slept well for about 6 hours.  I got up the next day and felt just fine.  I was maybe a little tired from being up later than usual, but no noticeable signs of a hangover.



Overall, I enjoyed this route of administration.  The mephedrone smoked well.  It melted and vaporized easily in a manner very similar to meth, and the smoke wasn't unpleasant at all.  When we ran out, I wasn't too terribly torn up over it, but if we had had more, we probably would have kept doing it.  Since smoking substances is more compulsive for me than insufflating or ingesting orally, I plan to be very careful, given mephedrone's reputation for causing users to redose excessively.  I know if I try smoking it again, I'll make sure we only have what we can reasonably use in one evening available, and leave the rest somewhere else.  I know a lot of people have done a lot more than 400mg in one go, but still, we had planned on having a bit left over from that bag and we ended up finishing it.  No harm done I guess, we both felt fine the next day, but now we just know to be more careful.
