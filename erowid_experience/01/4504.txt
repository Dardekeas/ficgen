I had heard that the best way to experience a full Salvia journey was a really hot burn and a *huge* lung-full. Well, I did just this using a simple homemade hooka. I cleared the entire bowl (packed tight) and held it in my lungs for about 10 seconds. I was thinking `mmmm.. I bet nothing happens' when WHAM! All of a sudden my entire reality was twisting, bending, warping around some invisible point in space of importance. I have no words to explain what happened over the next few minutes. All I can remember is alien words inside amazing swirling, geometric patterns, and extreme heat - I was sweating profusely apparently. 



What is of greater significance to me was what it left. As I was `unwinding,' I was explaining to my girlfriend how I felt. I was transfixed on a candle sitting on a coffee table. I was completely convinced that this was not `real' and everthing `is the same.' I knew I could bend the candle flame with my mind. The greatest suprise came as I explained this \ldots  in my own words\ldots 



`Everything is not real. The flame, the candle, the tree. It is all the same. It is nothing, and everything.'



Well, I did not notice straight away but my girlfriend said `What tree?' \ldots  



I had not `seen' the coffee table as a tree\ldots  but somehow my mind knew it was NOT a coffee table\ldots  it was a tree\ldots  



It is amazing how we take things of nature and change them, mold them, break them\ldots  and then completely insult their entire being, my `forgetting' what they are. From this day forth every such piece of nature is clear to me, and I am ashamed of how I have been.



Needless to say, this experience was INTENSE. I was very frightened, yet did not fear the plant itself. What I feared most was myself\ldots  and I felt guilty at my own being and the plant let me know that.



This plant is wonderful, and I know it is FAR from finished with me\ldots . but I do have advice. When done properly this experience is EXTREMELY intense. If you do not have experience with the mind-altering effects of plants other that marijuana, I would be VERY careful - even my experiences with LSD and Mushrooms were nothing compared to this (albeit much longer).
