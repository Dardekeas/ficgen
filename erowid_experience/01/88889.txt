About two or more years ago I started getting very interested in Entheogens and medicinal botanicals. I have already vastly entered the realms of psychedelia and drugs. More recently though I have found a new respect for drugs and life in general.



My experiences with entheogens such as mushrooms, lsd, salvia, mdma, lsa, hash have been crucial to my growth in spirituality and altered-states. Other drugs I have experimented with but now avoid are pharmaceuticals (Xanax, aderrall, valium, oxycontin etc.), alcohol, heroin, dxm (robo).



I have found that treating the substance respectfully by creating an experience with a well planned set and setting is the best way to experience any drug but mostly in my case, Entheogens and psychedelics. Which is what leads me to my latest experience with the Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose seed and smoking salvia extract in the peak of my hbws trip. 



PREPERATION: I grinded 10 seeds in a coffee grinder, then mixed em with some applesauce and enjoyed. 



ONSET: Within 45 minutes I notice a pleasant tingling or light buzzing in my legs and head. I got a little cold in my house to I decided to go on a walk for a bit. When I was walking I felt a little bit cramping or pain in my stomach area so I then sparked up my cannabis joint, which immediatley calmed any discomfort. After the joint and a half of mile walk I started feeling alert and felt a pressure around my eyes, not umpeasant at all, something that reminds me of when doing lsd. Energy bursts were creeping up on me anywhere from my inner thighs to my feet and head and body, so I decided to stroll on back home. 



Once I walked inside and took my shoes off, I quickly noticed an amazing amount of euphoria and bliss enter my consciousness much like a wave of lsd but with no visuals. At this point I sat relaxed on my couch and turned up some psychedelic music. Being a musician I suddenly realized how amazing and deep the music sounded. I layed back and let the music and energy waves coexist in my sensory field. Closing my eyes I saw green tunnels moving fast and eventually stopping at this huge neon green ball of light that was so vivid I knew it was a c.e.v. 



After about another hour and a half of exploring my closed eye visuals which were no where near mushrooms or lsd, but nonetheless very pleasant with the aid of music, I decided to take it up a few notches. I packed a nice sized hit of salvia 10x in my glass pipe and dimmed the lights and began meditating for I was not a begginer of the sacred herb and knew very well what sally could do.



I then acknowledged the power of salvia divinorum and asked her to give me a insightful and not to intense experience since I was already tripping. I wanted to break thru to the salvia dimensions, but I did not want to experience any `turbulence'. With that said I hit the pipe without letting the lighter stop burning the herb and took a huge hit and held it in for over 30 seconds. 



By the time I blew out the hit I saw my visual plane almost crack in time and within ten seconds I felt like I was being pushed really fast and squished next to other bodies of flesh. I was being pulled deep into the salvia world, with no idea what I was getting myself into. Finally after what seemed ten minutes I felt as if the force pushing me relaxed and I was able to vividly witness one huge archetypal image of multiple universes including ours being organized and controlled by this `pusher'. My emotions were shocked with this feeling of being infused with this pusher that pulled me out of my dimension. It was as if time was no more. I had no thought of the normal plane we all experience every day. My sole purpose was to move universes and spirits in correct alignment with me. Remember I fused with the pusher archetype that pulled me into this realm.



A vision of my infused form with the pusher entity was seen in a out of body experience like view. It is hard to explain what its appearance was. I can most closely relate it to a catapillar and a train and colorful images on its body and spirals around its aura. The vision lasted for a while, but slowly but surely was fading away and slowly but surely I realized I was looking at my living room. 



I was cracking up when I realized I just came back from the salvia trip because I actually forgot I was a human. I was like\ldots `no way!! Wow I forgot!'. After laying down and feeling the huge euphoric infusions of the afterglow of salvia and the lsa from the seeds. The salvia comedown intensified my lsa effects for 2 hours and I was literally getting amazing visuals that felt cartoon-like, some breathing or moving/dancing qualities on surfaces. I noticed very bright lights and almost tracer like images from lights in any form. The euphoria from the seeds were still waving in and out and slowly the salvia afterglow was gone. 



I smoked another joint and realized after the salvia experience fully subsided I was actually quite stimutlated. I went on a bike ride and then went home and talked on the phone to close friends enthusiastically. A lot of research I have done for hbws say that they are sedating for most people compared to the stimulating effects of lsd. I personally felt almost the same effects from lsd except the visuals, and the intense spiritual talkative mindset.



Overall Hbw seeds were not that nauseating as I thought they would be, they were actually quite stimulating, marked euphoria, energy burts, entactogenic qualities, very few opened eye visual, more chance of simple fantasy or imaganitive closed eye visuals, any discomfort from cramps were nuetralized from cannabis. The euphoric mind set was perfect for inducing me into the salvia trance, but I strongly suggest you be careful because I noticed the salvia trip seemed to last alot longer when I was on hbw seeds compared to just stoned or baseline. I also recall feeling like I was in the experience a lot longer, it seemed a lifetime before my return to home base. So if you don't want to have a very long in depth salvia experience that can be quite intense, then dont do hbw seeds first, but overall it was the most unique entheogenic experience I've had yet.
