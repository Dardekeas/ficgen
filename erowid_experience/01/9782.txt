 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# 


My friends and I decided to skip school. We ended up going to my friend's Apt. After an hour or so we were bored and considered going to school but my buddy `Nick' suggested that we take coricidin and `trip our faces off.' I had never done it before and was told that it's great. Like any person would I trusted my friend and took 10 and thought\ldots  WTF i'll pop 6 more.

My body felt really loose and I was fine for maybe 20 min until I got nausous. I laid down on the kitchen floor because it was cool ( i felt like I was burning up) to try and feel better but that was no help. I couldn't even get up to get to the bathroom, I crawled to the bathroom and dry-heaved\ldots  I couldn't breathe and I was shaking like crazy. I closed the door so I couldn't hear everyone talking because I couldn't understand them and it scared the hell out of me b/c I was tripping out. I went in and out of consciousness and once in a while my friend would open the door and check on me and I couldn't even mumble words to her. Remember that I'm in a bathroom\ldots  I hallucinated that I was driving my car, talking to people\ldots  doing REAL things - I saw some wicked colors too and then i'd snap back into reality long enough to realize where I was and puke - not to mention I was struggling to breathe. At that point I thought I had overdosed and was dying. 

Eventually the nausousness went away and I made my way into a bed. Even then I couldn't respond to people. After god knows how long, I wasn't sick\ldots I wasn't even tripping but I had began to roll. I was incredibly happy and turned on some music and danced my ass off. Never again will I do that sh*t. It was SO scary.
