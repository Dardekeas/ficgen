It was just a normal summer night. My buds decided to come chill at my house for a lil bit and they were interested in trying some methylphendiate (generic ritalin). so i went inside to the medicine cabinet and got 2 small pills. As i rummaged around through the cabinet I noticed my mothers depression medication. Fluoxentine, however you spell it, or Prozac.  I took 2 pills out and proceeded to join the gang in the monte carlo and take some lines.  I told them its prozac  and heard its good and two of them said they wanted to try it. The other decided to pass. After M. and P. snorted the riddies, we crushed up the prozacs. The powder look very fluffy and white and kind of yelled at all of us,'snort me!' I wish i would have never gotten those pills to begin with.

And for the rest of the time i was in more pain than I deserved.  My throat felt like it was `ripping apart.' It was kind of like having mono but 10 times worse.  I tried to ignore it and drank some coke and two bottles of water.  Still this nasty feeling in my throat stayed and i felt like absolute shit. I felt like the floor of a movie theater. Miserable.  My eyes were burning and my throat felt like it was bleeding. So i went upstairs and took a gatorade with me and hopped in the shower. I turned the water to almost freezing cold and put my mouth up to it and just let the water go into my throat.  Every now and then id drink some gatorade and just proceed to let the water run down my throat. there is NOTHING you
