I was quite anxious to try Sceletium tortuosum but my local herb-supplier recommended it so I bought a gram of Sceletium tortuosum in powder-form. I decided to take the snuff to a house party where my freinds also wanted to experiment with the drug, I decided to snort a line before drinking just incase alcohol duds the effects and felt a mild high, like that of cannabis but I felt more in control of myself. 



I then went on to have a few bottles of wifebeater(stella), which turned into a few more!(6 or 7) I then snorted a few more lines and was starting to act hyperactive and felt senses of euthoria-kind of like the effects from cocaine! I then went on to have a nice fat joint of cannabis. 



By this time I was feeling great and the Sceletium tortuosum seemed to inhance the other drugs effects. I went well on into the night and didnt notice any side-effects. I did wake up with a big hangover but im pretty sure that was because of the alcohol!
