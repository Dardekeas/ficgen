I found a recipe online that was quoted to be the amount that the Peruvians use for a single dose of Ayahuasca; it said about a 12 inch piece of vine of Banisteriopsis caapi and 50 fresh leaves of Psychotria viridis.  I used half of this (and i recommend that you should too, more on that later)\ldots I whittled down a 6 inch piece of B. caapi with a utility knife and used about 30 dry leaves.



I broke up the whittled pieces of B. caapi with my hands until they were fairly fine fibers.  I boiled everything at one time in a glass pot (Terence McKenna says that an aluminum of a pot can negatively effect the brew)\ldots I boiled everything (a rolling boil) for 1 hour and then poured off the liquid into another bowl; then added new distilled water and boiled it again. I did this for a total of 4 times until the liquid that I was pouring off was more of a clear yellow.  I threw out the plant material, added up the liquids and very slowly boiled down the liquid until I had about 200ml of liquid that had the color of nice, deep, chocolate milk.  I drank 100ml.



I've had two other experiences on Ayahuasca before this. They were very nice and `euphoric', with very organic, strange, geometric visuals.  But this third time I knew I did a better job preparing a stronger brew.  But I did a much better job than I could ever imagine.



But first, my recommendation to you; go very slow, i mean, certainly don't drink a lot your first time.  Slowly, over time, build up the amounts you drink.  Test your brew's strength before you drink a big dose.  I think you know what I mean; but let me tell you my story so you will become cautious and respectful of this drink, because I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I had to:



I did not eat 4 hours before drinking.  After an hour of drinking this bitter stuff, in an instant, without warning, I was very panicked and very afraid.  Terrified.  My world was replaced with something else that was not `here'.  Everything was TOO vibrant, sounds did not sound `right'.  It was very very scary, I paced around, freaking out, trying to not be `there', but I realized it was useless to try, this scared me even more.  I ended up sitting up on my bed, back against some pillows, drenched in sweat that I could not control.  I was trying to relax.  I was in this `world' for only a few minutes, but it seemed like forever.  This place was the most frightening thing I have ever seen.  This `burst' or `glimpse' faded into another `world'\ldots into a `lower world'\ldots distinctly different from the first but not as `fast'\ldots but almost as equally terrifying.



Let me pause here for a moment. If you do this: I noticed that people near-by (i mean, the apartments near me) experience something too, even though they don't drink the brew.  I did not like this at ALL!\ldots it made it much harder to deal with.  I would have been much better off being somewhere that was miles and miles away from anyone, especially since my experience was so powerful for me.



Ok, this `lower realm' scared me very much.  I was teased by something.  Basically, I wanted a big experiance and the answer I got was: `ok, here you go! we will REALLY give it to you. we will make you very frightened, and you will be humbled'.  Terence Mckenna put it a good way: `Their [the 'fairies'] idea of `fun' might not be your idea of `fun'.'  I was kind of laughed at\ldots it was not fun for me at the time.  At this point I just wanted it to end, and I was trying to wait it out\ldots but it took a very long time (almost 2 hours).  I was trying to fight it off and calm it down, but it was persistent on me.  I was shown many things, and `taught'.  It was a very personal experience.  After it was done I thought: Oh my GOD! I got through it!  The day after I was still very shaken up.  After a few more days of thinking about it, I was very happy that I did it and got through it; even though it was deathly terrifying at the time.  



It's not that this place IS a `scary place', but I think we `perceive' it as being a very scary place indeed.  I had many experiences during this time that go far beond `hallucinations', and where far more real.  I believe I caught a very small glimpse of what's `really going on'\ldots and this `small glimpse' was quite a lot for my human mind to see.



So, what have I seen to be what is `really going on'?\ldots I won't say. :) Most everyone would never believe me\ldots  nor would want to, because it's just too weird! :)  But what's great is that our human minds are capable of seeing this `truth'!  That's the fun part.



Be safe and respectful of Ayahuasca; I would recommend building up your `levels' slowly, that can make it much more confortable. You could drink a bunch, but it could really freak you out more than I could ever explain -- you would get through it!, but your experience can be very terrifying.  Good luck.  :)



After this experience I have learned enough to not have a desire to visit this place for awhile.



At a lower dose you feel wonderfully euphoric and you can slowly enter\ldots `something'!\ldots for me it was a extremely real parallel dimension that is always with us, but we don't usually see it.  And this place is very welcome of visitors.  It's a mischievous place, but they welcome you.



Good luck and I wish you safe and comfortable choices.  :)
