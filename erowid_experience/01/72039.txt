I think that these stories about Naltrexone are very important. Mine is a little different. 



I had been taking oxycontin and dilaudid for years, but I had been struggling to get off them almost from the start. I had been taking either 150 mg Dilaudid (or the equivalent amount of oxy) daily for about 6 months solid. I had booked a trip to Africa to detox and I could not get a legitimate prescription for that amount to carry over the border. My supplier was running low, so I had no choice but to try to rapid detox myself. The doctor suggested that I could squeeze by taking the Naltrexone after being off opiates for 5 days, the pharmacist told me 10 days clean first.



After ZERO days clean, I woke at 8 am Saturday morning (flight scheduled for Tuesday morning). I immediately took a tranquilizer (clonazapam) and after waiting 1/2 hour, I took 1/2 of a Naltrexone tablet. After 10 minutes the floor fell out of my existance. I could not move from the couch. I puked and puked actual projectile vomiting, right on the floor beside my couch in my living room. I barely was capable of turning my head to make sure the vomit did not land on me or choke me. Never-the-less, I almost did choke. I had never puked like that before. It just kept coming and coming and I could not get a breath in edgewise. I was pretty sure that I would die from choking on my own puke.



A friend came over and an found me on the couch puking again about 10 minutes to 1 hour later. Somehow they managed to help me upstairs to the bedroom and washroom area. I sat on the toilet as best as I could and PEED out my arse-hole for about 15 minutes then sat for another hour itermitently doing the same thing. All the while I was experiencing all the other typical withdrawl symptoms TIMES 10!



I somehow got cleaned up, I think my friend helped, and into the next room, which was the bedroom. He put a big puke bucket by the side of the bed, asked if I needed to get to the hospitol - I declined. He left. I remained in bed, in a delerium, missing the puke bucket a few times more. At about 6 pm, I begged someone to come over who had some dilaudid and they did. They gave me my regular dose for an evening. I managed to keep it down! It was enough to keep the worst of the withdrawl pain at bay.



The 1/2 pill's effects lasted a couple of days; slowly tapering off and allowing the opiates to have more and more effect. I missed my flight to Africa. I got clean a month later by heading to the bush on the other side of the continent (a cabin with a jacuzzi and a swimming pool).



Watch yourself around Naltrexone!
