For the last six months, I've been having a lot of dental work done.  Thank the Lord for my dentist, he gives me a new Vicodin prescription almost every appointment.  But up until yesterday, I've only taken the recommended dosage.  I should also mention here that when it comes to drug use, I'm a feather-weight.  I do drink but I've only smoked weed four times.  Why did I decide to take 20mg instead of the usual 7.5mg?  Well, I've been in an emotional state lately and have had a lot on my mind.  Not a good reason, I know.  Anyway, I was staring at the bottle and grew curious.  I was hesitant to take any without knowledge of it's affects.  So I went online for experience reports and an idea of dosages.  Feeling pretty confident in my gained knowledge, I took two 7.5mg at 9:50pm.  I had dinner about 20 minutes prior, I won't eat first next time.



At 10:10pm, I got out of my chair to take another 5mg pill (from an older prescription) and noticed my legs feeling jellied.  Walking wasn't difficult after I got started.  I took the 5mg and then sat back down in my chair and watched tv.  At 10:45pm, I decided to sit in bed and watch the tube.  I still wasn't feeling the effects I had read about.  But once I sat down on the mattress, I didn't move for ten minutes.  I was merely breathing shallowly and blinking.  Not a super long time to not move, of course, but the feeling I was now having was too good to disturb.  My mind felt cloudy but yet somehow acutely aware.  Aware of what, I'm not sure.  Similar to nitrous oxide, but without the superb tingle I get from laughing gas.



I wanted to get more comfortable on my bed, I was sitting on the edge and was afraid I would slip off, and then realized that I wasn't sure if I could move.  I could barely feel my limbs.  I had stopped holding my head up so it was just resting back on my shoulders, causing me to stare at the ceiling.  But once I gave the task some effort, which was hard to muster, I was able to move and everything was fine.  I centered myself on the bed and allowed myself to fall back under the drug's spell.  I must've looked horrible because my head kept lolling and my eyes were half closed.  But I felt completely calm and warm.  It was a beautiful feeling.  By 11:15pm, I could tell I had peaked and was now on the down side but it was so gradual that I still felt perfectly locked inside my body.  This is that `acutely aware' feeling.



While I laid back watching tv, I realized that no position I laid in was more comfortable than the next.  Everything thing was comfy.  However my legs were positioned, wherever my hands were, everything felt good and I never wanted to move again.  But inevitably I would.  Movement created this new type of tingle that I haven't experienced outside of sexual arousal before.  It was close to the deep bone tingle I get when I wake up and have sex during the middle of the night.  That building of a sleepy orgasm.  I'm not sure how long I laid there, but I think I dozed off around 11:45pm.  I woke up again at 12:37am (I remember looking at the clock) but I sat up in a panic, worried that I had stopped breathing.  Of course, I hadn't.  So I got up to turn the overhead light off and found that I was walking like I'd been drinking.  The task wasn't too difficult and I was able to sleep pretty well for the rest of the night.  I did wake up frequently but that's something I tend to do anyway.  I was always able to fall right back asleep.



When I woke up this morning, I could still feel the lack of coordination and muscle relaxation.  This didn't last long and once I had breakfast, felt fine.  My conclusion?  I highly recommend hydrocodone.  It was a nice relaxing high that I thoroughly enjoyed.  But this isn't something I would want to do around other people.  All I wanted to do was lay down and enjoy it, not be social.  And my previous emotional state had no bearing on my high.  It wasn't even a factor.  It's way better than alcohol.  And way better than weed.  Draw backs?  None really.  I felt a slight twinge of nausea but certainly nothing to write home about.  Not enough to diminish the affects.  Next time, I'm going to take 22.5mg and I'm not going to eat dinner.  That should pack quite a good punch.
