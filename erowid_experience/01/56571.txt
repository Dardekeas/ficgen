It was the fourth of July, I had obtained 100 milligrams of doi several months before. I am no stranger to eating RC's let me give you the run down before anyone out there try's to take as much doi as I did. I have ate DOI, 2ci, 2ce, 2ct4, methylone several analogs of foxy 4aco dipt, 4ho dipt, 4ho mipt, (5meo mipt the real deal) and 4aco mipt, also 5meo dmt (5meo amt very toxic I don't recommend for anyone) amt much different then the 5meo analog this is wonderful but hard to obtain now that it is illegal and dmt very amazing as well.  



Enough talk about the chemicals that have run though my blood stream. Doi had been on my list for quite some time I was just waiting for a good day to eat it so I figured what better day to do it then on the fourth of July. The highest dose I had read about any one eating at this time was 4 milligrams. So I took precautions making sure I gave my self the right dose. So I took a 100 milligrams and put it in a  visene bottle and then took another viseen bottle that was sanitized and had distilled water in it I then put one hundred drops of water into the bottle with the hundred milligrams of chemical. After much research I found distilled water would not jeopardize the chemical makeup and make it very easy to dose one drop per milligram. 



Because I know I can eat more 2ci then most people I felt that I would be safe starting my dose at 6 milligrams dripped on a sugar cube. I ate the cube around 5pm around 6:30pm the first of the trip came on; very euphoric mild visuals, intense sense of well being, no sickness or toxic feeling, this is all good, so I took 4 more milligrams then went to the fire work show. By the time I got there and met up with my friends who I also gave this to in lower doses we were all in a full blown trips and I knew this was no 8 hours and your down kind of trip. At this point I was going to be going for a long time. 28 hours I later found out. Everyone was having a blast. I think Mr. Hoffman finally met his match. Thank you DR Shulgin this is much like 2ci only way better. 



It came on and stayed more like a candy flip wonderful visuals bitchen body buzz everything I had hoped only better. After the fire works we all decided to retire back to my house and smoke herb and keep this trip going I then gave out more 4 milligram cubes to anyone who wanted more, damn this dose not stop now about 14 hours in we are all partying no one had any bad vibes nervousness or paranoia some people decided to go home. 



We said our good byes me and my friend matt the two freaks in the group decided to eat more the more we ate the harder we tripped still going next thing I know it is time for me to go to work around hour 20 and I was far from down. So I ate 4 more milligrams and went to work. I sell phones, it was a great day at work even in a call center environment I was fine 9 hour shift I still came out on top got 10 sales and ended with the highest gross activation on the floor tripping balls on the best chemical I have ever tripped on. I have eaten it many times since in lower doses with nothing but great reviews just be careful dosing it because 6 milligrams could make you trip for 15 hours but 10 could keep you going for 20 plus. 



Sorry this is such a messy story I decided to write it on about 200 milligrams of methylone.  I hope you learned something off it though most people don't like this trip because they fear it so they don't eat enough they only eat like 4 milligrams and only trip a little and just stay awake well me and about ten other experienced trippers I know ate it in excess 12 milligrams plus several times with no bad trips no sickness nothing but a excellent extremely long lasting trips.
