\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:EXTREME\_HIGH\_DOSE\#\#



I found a bottle of my old strattera for treating adhd and I downed 30 of em. I layed in bed for an hour or so and it hit me like a speeding bullet. My heart started beating so fast like a race horse and it was unexplainable how fast my heart was beating. After a while I layed in bed in a pile of sweat cause its working my heart so much like I'm basicly running a marathon. So after 4 hours after talking to people and saying my goodbuys I look at the cieling and I have flags in my room and they start flying like a flag in a hurricane with no wind whatsoever. I wanted to go smoke a cigarrate so bad but there was no way whatsoever of getting up. I felt like I was going to throw up. My heart was still beating like a race horse. So then after saying no to go getting a cigarette I just passed out. I woke up the next morning pissed that I wasent dead cause I was tottally sure I would of and I like totally accepted that I was. 



NEXT DAY: Not much of a story for the next day just that if I even walked a block my heart would hurt so bad that I couldnt walk anymore. So it was really cool but it would probally be like taking lsd or something more halluciginic. I still cried also.
