8:15pm -- This is my first time with DPT\ldots  I obtained a 99.8\% pure off white powder\ldots .I set up for the solo trip in my black lit room\ldots I snort 100mg in three lines\ldots  very little burn

\ldots .I put in a live Phish album



8:30pm -- Strong nervous energy emerging\ldots Vision becoming blurred and my room starts swirling in my perephial vision



8:45pm -- Complete glow of energy similar to 4 strong acid tabs\ldots  Vibrations from the music are increadible as it seems to be living through me\ldots  ego flattened, gravity disappearing, I feel united with my spirit \ldots  as close to a 5-MeO-DMT flash as another drug has taken me



8:55 -- Music becoming a force more intense than I want, I turn the music off\ldots . A small group of my friends stop by my house knowing my state. From this point my journey takes a negative spin and I can't note exact times. I feel DPT alters the mind's usual perception of time to an extreme, seemingly bringing time to A STAND STILL at points of the trip.



So my friends come over as I am peaking in this experience. The simple thought of an idea or feeling of a sense is enough to send my mind spinning for infinite loops on the edge of sanity. See, I knew that DPT was introspective drug best suited for a private setting, but I didnt figure just HOW AWFULLY MUCH having my friends conversing in my environment would affect my trip. 



I believe I was spoken to by an alien/other/logos voice that was specifically touching on themes of the future of humans and their place in the universe. Eccentric yet possible theories were shared for how sustaining human life beyond the surface of earth and into deep space could happen.



The visuals reached a point of frozen moment open/closed eye mega visions. I had a particular incident of my friend speaking, then in slide show fashion a few frames of him saying that particualr phrase repeated itself over and over on top of each other, then the images of his face faded into a neon outline which transformed into something like a cartoonish dog. I found this very overwheliming at the time.



One of my muscially gifted friends began strumming a guitar for the group. I was standing at the time quite restless. Each note he played seemed to lift me of the ground in intense heavenly pleasure as the vibrations swarmed about me, like little fairies pulling me up by my shirt's collar.



After about 2 and a half hours I was no longer overwhelmed by the drug, but in a nice psychedelic place for about the next 3 hours until I fell asleep. Smoking a few pipes of herb was nice during that period. the experience as being `Rufied by an alien'. 

The way this drug whipped me about in the hyperspatial realm lead me to coining the experience as being `Rufied By an Alien'.



I would say DPT could take m places very similar to those of high doses of mushrooms. I have done more experimenting with DPT and have not been disappointed. I would prefer having started at the 50mg level though.
