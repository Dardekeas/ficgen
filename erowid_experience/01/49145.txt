In 1998 while in college, I experienced my first panic attack.  It happened actually in a very calm and serene moment, I was very happy and was about to go to bed with my girlfriend.   That's when it hit me, my mind was racing faster then I could handle it, I started sweating, feeling nauseous, like I had lost my mind. I was convinced I went insane.  I couldn't sit still so I got up and drove over 100 miles to one of my work sites just to try and shake it off.  After an exhausting night I got home and was mentally paralyzed at what had just happened to me.  My grades were horrible that quarter as you can imagine.  



After about 2 years trying to do research and learning about my illness -- The hardest part was trying to figure out what I exactly had, and to un train my natural aversion to mental illness.  I bought books, read articles on the internet, tried to exercise, eat healthy, sleep adequately etc. I also tried to take alternative drugs to heal myself (St. John's Wort, Tea, meditation, breathing exercises etc) Eventually after 2 years of painful bouts of panic attacks -- it seem to go away.



One day at work during a meeting I had this uncontrollable urge to urinate, and no matter what I did it seemed to not go away.  I had to excuse myself from work numerous times and I knew people were confused.  Embarrassed I just told them that I was taking allergy medication and it made me have bowel problems.  At this point I knew that I had to seek professional help.



I went to see a Doctor and he prescribed me Paxil.  Thank God, it worked immediately -- all the problems went away.  



The biggest problem about it is I may very well be on it for life.  It's not cheap either \$133 for 30 25mg pills.  I have been on it now for 3 years and I think I might be on it for life.  Anytime I stop taking it, I start to feel the panic come back.  Also if you miss a dose I get bad headaches and nausea.  But considering this drug probably saved my life -- I will not complain.



Thanks
