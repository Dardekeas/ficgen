Okay, i've done a total of about 22 (super hoffmans strength) acid tabs, over a period of a year and a half. the total number of times tripping was about 20 times, with sometimes me only taking halves or once just an eigth of a trip, with the most being 4 trips. (Well it was quite a bit more than 22 trips, but in hoffman strength i've worked it out to be 22. I'd estimate that a hoffman's trip is probabbly about 150mcg?)



Note: i've never had a bad trip, although i've had a few bad aspects to a trip. the closest to a bad trip was when me and my friends saw lots of little dots disappearing into the middle of the ground and then suddenly realised it was a giant ants nest, and there were ants crawling over my skin. i think in reality there were probabbly only about two, but i immediately thought there were hundreds and i thought they'd got inside my veins somehow - because i could see and feel them crawling inside my veins. that really freaked me out but after about a half an hour i calmed myself down.



I've also smoked quite a lot of cannabis, and have probably taken in total about 5/6grams of ketamine (over past year and a half?). I've done a 50mg dose of 2ct7 once, which didn't agree with me and was nothing like what people describe it as being like. I've also had about 60 or so ecstacy pills. And I've done 5-meo dmt 5 times, only once properly (well each time i got a mild high, but only once i got a ***fucking umbelievably fucked most visually amazing intense experience***).



In the past couple of months i've started getting flashbacks though. i think i first noticed flashbacks after about 3 or 4 times tripping, when i'd probabbly taken a total of about 2 hoffmans. i could slightly make the ground ripple/pulsate, like there was a little creature crawling beneath the carpet or something. i knew it wasn't real and it was quite fun to do.



probabbly on about the 6th or 7th time tripping we noticed that, while we were tripping (on a whole hoffmans trip), we could see an `invisible layer' infront of what was physically there. because before we'd only had visuals on physical objects (trees / walls with repetitive wallpapering etc.), but now sitting in the forest (the one they've got in the beginning of the gladiator movie!!) i could see a big invisible (partially visible/see through) fish floating infront of the tree's.  also when looking up at the clouds i could see swirling around flying cloudy dots flying about in the sky etc.



at the time i don't think i could see any invisible stuff when i wasn't tripping though. i don't know when i realised it though, but i found out 

that after taking pills the next day if i were to look at say a flat white wall, i would be able to see slight shadows and slight swirls of really slight different shades of white. the next day, after catching up 

on sleep and eating etc. i would be back to normal though (i think?\ldots ).



i didn't really realise it as it was happening because everything was so 

gradual, but i think i began to see `invisible' stuff more frequently. like in uni lectures when i was looking at the whiteboard i would be able to see the slight shadows on the board when the lighting was quite dim. also in the one lecture theatre i would slightly imagine a light grey in colour, really fine spray of water coming down from each ceiling tile. but i could not think about it and it would stop. i didn't really think anything of it, probabbly because at the time i wasn't really getting much sleep and drinking and smoking a bit aswell as doing a pill or two every couple of weekends.



when i did dmt properly (about 3 months ago?) the day after when i was back home i kept on thinking my phone was ringing in my closed bedroom, while i was watching tv. the phone ring is quite quiet, and sometimes when i'm watching tv i think i hear it ringing anyway, although i probabbly heard it about 10 times this evening. it wasn't me completely making it up, it was more like me hearing sounds on tv and me misinterpreting them and then thinking my phone was ringing.



i did a half a trip (some girl in a club just gave it to me a while ago) of some unbelievably strong acid a couple of weeks later. i'd planned on doing it before we got to the club (tyssen st studios in london), and then a few sugarcubes in there. but i didn't need the cubes because i was so fucked (in a very good way!). the intensity was also probabbly due to me and my friend finishing half a gram of ketamine (or i'm thinking now maybe because of me doing the dmt two weeks b4??), and having a really strong white tulip pill in the club. acid's never allowed me to transform music to that extent before. i was hearing the sounds completely surrounding me, and the music (psytrance) that was being played was so completely mindblowing that whenever a song came on that i recognised i would be elevated to such an immensely high state of consciousness! all the music sounded *completely* different, my brain must have been working in serious overdrive to fine-tune each sound to be so heavenly spectacular - and all the sounds together just completely blew me into another dimension!!!



at one point in the club when i went into the corners of the room of the basement, i felt as if i was delving into the furthest corner of my mind. and i felt myself becoming really close to that extreme state that i was on 5-meo. it actually became too intense to and i had to go back to the middle of the dancefloor. upstairs it felt as if the laser was beaming directly into the retina of my eye, and i was in a dimension where everything was made up of octagons. mindblowing!!when i got back home i needed to listen to some chill out music, so i put on smashing pumpkings. the most amazing trance music i've ever heard! yes i know it's not trance, but my mind was completely warping and altering the music. and when i took a shower and moved my head beneath the water, unbelieavable!!



but since that trip i haven't been able to come completely back down to 

baseline. i keep on seeing invisible patterns and shadows, like those described in http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd\_info3.shtml



like when i read i can sometimes (quite often) see positive afterimages of the text slightly above and to the left of the writing. i can still read fine, but it's just a bit off putting and i have to read slower.



if i want i can stare at a flat surface and imagine (invisible) 

geometric patterns, or a girl (like in charlies angels) dancing. i know they're just shadows/invisible and not real, maybe all this time i've been training myself to have a really hyper-over imagination.



i can imagine stuff really realisticly with my eyes shut, like playing a computer game. and outside colours are a *lot* more vivid than they 

normally were (i think?).



i also get positive afterimages of an object for a few seconds when i stare at something, and then look away at something else\ldots 



and i've noticed sometimes when i listen to music i can hear stuff which isn't actually there, like extra patterns made with sounds like my sony j5 mobile phone makes\ldots 



shit! most of the time it doesn't really bother me, when i'm out doing stuff i don't really notice it. it's only when i'm doing work or sitting down usually. but sometimes it frightens me because i think, `what the fuck have i done to myself?'. i hope that it'll go away (so i can do more acid again!! or maybe i think i probabbly shouldn't\ldots \ldots .). i'm worried that it won't though\ldots  :(



does anyone know if there has been any research into cases like this, 

and what were the outcomes? i've stopped taking acid now (well for 2 months now). i've done pills twice, and i've noticed they haven't helped. also ketamine makes everything get quite a lot more fucked for a few days after, so i know i've got to stop taking those two. ketamine's not the same after taking that 5-meo dmt anyway. (or maybe it's not the same now because i stared at the `silicon kaleidoscope screensaver' when i was on k once\ldots  another story.)



also smoking gear and drinking alcohol, and not getting enough sleep and being under stress make it worse aswell. shit!! so i think i need to have a big break from everything, which is going to be hard - especially because i can't really explain the story to all my friends\ldots 



is there anything else that could help me? does anyone know if i'll b fucked forever? well i shouldn't really say fucked because i can still 

live a normal really great life, getting approx 65\%+ overall at uni (first year) so far..



so just a warning to everyone who's as naive as i was, thinking you can't get flashbacks off acid. i don't think everyone get's flashbacks, or as the report i mentioned earlier states that there's a peak of being 

prone to receiving flashbacks at 15 exposures, and then one at 40 exposures. i think it's probabbly a combination of the drugs as to why i get flashbacks, as in the report there's no mention of auditory flashbacks\ldots 



[Erowid Note: Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder (HPPD) is more appropriately used to describe this sort of visual disturbances, rather than the term `flashback'.  It should also be noted that while classic hallucinogens like LSD are more commonly thought of in association with this sort of perceptual change, it is also quite possible for frequent use of MDMA or other substances like 5-MeO-DMT to have this affect.  In this case, the author has used significantly more MDMA than LSD\ldots so it seems likely that both have contributed to the lasting visual effects.]
