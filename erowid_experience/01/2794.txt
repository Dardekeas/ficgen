It was about 2:00 in the afternoon on a sat. I snorted this weird drug over at my friends house whom gave it to me, about 10 min after I felt strange and went home. when I got there I puked on the floor and then in the bathroom. right after it felt almost like I was tripping, I started having the best visuals I have ever had. I tried to enjoy it but I felt very sick the whole time,I lifed my shirt up and It looked like my skin was bubbling and turned purple. 



one of my other friends came over and asked what was wrong I told her I felt like I was going to die so she checked my pulse and it was normal. later I saw a four dimensional world where inbetween the space of the walls in the house I saw almost like spirits flowing around in the room, also I kept on seeing floating crosses going in circles everywhere in the room.

after about one hour the visuals went away and I felt like I had alot of energy and was able to leave my house without fear. I went up to the park and met my friend who gave it to me and we talked about it. I wouldnt ever do it again, but I do reccomend trying it If you can handle your drugs.
