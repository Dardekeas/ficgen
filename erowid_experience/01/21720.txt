My first real experience with mushrooms was better than what i expected BY FAR!!!

I had tried shrooms a couple other times but took small amounts after drinking, so didn't really feel much of the drug.

My friend and I had decided to do musshrooms the weekend her parents went away.  we got 7 grams split between the two of us.

  

We ate them at around 7pm with some salt and vinegar chips to take away the taste of them. About an hour later, I still felt completely fine, and didnt really know when the drug would take effect.  Another 20 minutes passed by when I really started to get frustrated because the drug wasn't doing anything, not realizing it was because I was laughing hysterically at little things and my eyes were watering non-stop.  My friend was still completely fine when mine kicked in completely.  I felt amazing!! Every muscle in my body was relaxed and  I just felt like moving back and forth, back and forth! the perfect explenation for the way you feel on shrooms is a `lava lamp'. Once my friend's finally kicked in, I was fully tripping out.  



We spent the next 4 hours wondering her house, looking at pictures and rooms.  The colours and the way her house was set up. We felt like taking pictures of some parts of her house because it looked too amazing and perfect.  For the longest time i felt like i didn't know which part of the room was the ceiling, floor or wall. If i was sitting down on the floor i felt like i was sitting on the wall.  My hand was very entertaining also, it kept changing skin tones. All I wanted to do was just sit and look at every little thing in the room. I spent most of the time layin on the ground with my legs on the wall.  This made it feel even better. 



I also found myself analyzing everything in life.  I seemed to figure everything out.  Being a regular pot smoker, I decided after my mushroom experience not to smoke pot so often.   I haven't seem to need the urge to smoke it or want it since. 



At around 1:30am, the shrooms started wearing off, and we decided to watch a movie, which we were planning on doing earlier, but there were too many other things to do while tripping. 



I defintely recommend mushrooms to other people.  But when you do it make sure your in an environment where you can handle the drug.  For the first time, being in a safe and calm setting I believe helped a lot.  I don't think I could have had such a good trip if it was at a party around tones of people.



Amazing time, can't wait for another!!
