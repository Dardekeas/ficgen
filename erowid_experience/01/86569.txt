I have experimented with many opiates in the past and was stuck with oxycontin as my favorite for a few months. One day when in search of oxys I was offered a 10mg opana for 15 dollars. Even though I doubted what I was getting would be worth it, I bought the pill. My friend L and I both did 5mgs and were almost instantly bound to the couch. This has been my drug of choice ever since. 



I began to get 10mg instant release opana every week or two as I could afford them. I did 5-20mgs which was enough to give me the nod and after about an hour of fighting it, eventually I would fall asleep. I had a mild amount of itching which would cause short bursts of euphoria when scratched. The only negative part is when I fall asleep and wake up in the morning saying `damn I could have enjoyed that for a couple more hours'. 



My most enjoyable experience with this wonderful drug was when I did 30mgs up the nose.



0:00: I snort a long thin line of oxymorphone and feel the powder in my throat- a sign of a good sniff. There is a little bit of a bitter taste but nothing too bad. The pill doesn't burn at all and gives almost instant gratification. 



0:10: My friend and I are sitting next to each other trying to have a conversation but we both just trail off and stop talking. We're both sitting there with our eyes shut nodding off, feeling euphoria so great that I wanted to start moaning, only I was too messed up to give up that kind of effort.



0:15: Four friends show up to do some Opana only to find us sitting there half asleep. We're both startled by their entry but we did open our eyes and say hey. My friend starts smoking gravity bongs with the other kids that showed up. I didn't move except for when I was called to the GB after one or two hits I was done. 



0:30: By this time my friends were concerned for me as they saw that I was becoming increasingly unable to function. This whole time I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world and I reassure them by opening my eyes and smiling. I continued to sit on the couch and take an occasional bong hit for about another half an hour before I finally decided that I had to lay down. My eye lids felt very heavy and I knew that Opana had won. I fell asleep within a minute of my head touching the pillow. I awoke in the morning with my hangover or cravings, I just wished I had stayed up longer. 



Overall Review:



The high is much more euphoric than any other opiates I've done. The come up is very intense and within 10 minutes of snorting it I begin peaking. There is a rushing sensation in the back of my head and I enjoy and appreciate everything and everyone around me. I have trouble doing anything but sitting motionless with my eyes closed. This is how I usually enjoy my high as the more relaxed I become the more I feel the drug sweeping me away. The euphoria is comparable to sex at high doses although that euphoria quickly drops once you start moving.



The main negatives were that I was very easily annoyed when I'm just buzzed and I want more or when someone would forced me to open my eyes and be coherent. At lower doses where I could still walk around a bit (although I felt very heavy) I wasn't annoyed at all and enjoyed my surroundings and a optimistic attitute. This is a very different high than the sleeplike state induced my heavy doses yet both are very pleasurable. Compared to Oxycontin I'd say Opana is 4-5 times stronger. I say this because I had more of an effect from doing 10mgs of opana than 40mgs of oxys even though the OC was done a few days prior to the opana.
