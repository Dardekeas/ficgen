I found myself unemployed with free time between school schedules, so I thought I'd put it to good use.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# 



From known weights, usually 250 mg or 100 mg, I have eyeballed divisions to guess at my pill weights.  So there is probably a +/-5\% involved.



This report is specifically for a series of trials with 2C-E.



12.5 mg ingested orally proves very visual, but physiologically overwhelming, vomiting is probably a given.



8.66 mg orally relieves the physical, although the emotionally unstable my still have a bit of difficulty integrating (and will still pop.)  This is my dose in snuff, a bit harder than the 12.5 mg oral dose, but 2c-e has an effect within 15 minutes by this route, otherwise it can take an hour to two hours.



2ct-2 trials, 31.25 mg oral.  



The trip was amazing, the visuals were almost constant\ldots  distinctly distortions of what I was seeing though, nothing manifested as with a pot/acid combo.  I make mention of this chem though, for it has greater potential as a synergist.  2c-e, usually at 10 mg with 20-25mg 2ct-2 creates oceans out of carpet, rainbows from white walls, etc.



Trips are usually visual for 5 hours after onset; for 2C-E and 2c-I. The visuals are pretty hard to ignore the first 3 of those (I refer to it as the self-guided phase).



2C-E becomes unbearable past 2x a dose.
