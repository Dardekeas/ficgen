My mom gets OTC pills with codeine in them for her bad headaches.

Each pill contains 300mg of Acetaminophen, 15mg Caffeine and 8mg of codeine. Since this was my first time I decided to take 8 pills which totals:

64mg Codeine

120mg Caffeine

2400mg Acetaminophen



I took the pills followed by a glass of water around 1:30am once everyone had gone to sleep. By 2:00am I was starting to feel it, I got all warm and a little itchy and everything was kind of a dull numb. I could bite my lip pretty hard and barely feel it.

At around 2:30 I peaked and then this is where something went wrong.



My arms started getting jittery, I developed a slight headache, my neck started hurting and my stomach started getting upset. I had to lie down to stop my arms from jittering, and myself from possibly puking. I decided to abandon my computer and go lie down for the night. I felt pretty tired but the caffeine seemed to keep me awake. While laying down every now and then it was like I got hit with a wave of numbness. I managed to drift in and out of sleep and around 4:00am I woke up with the worst stomach pain ever. I wriggled around for about what must of been 20 minutes hoping for the pain to stop.

After it went away I went back to sleep.



Now I dont know exactly what caused this, but I'm thinking the jitters came from the caffiene.



I will try this again, but this time I will use the extraction technique to filter out the acetaminophen as I'm sure that had some sort of adverse effect.
