First of all, I have very little experience with mind altering drugs. I have smoked marijuana a good bit in the past but have only tripped one time on mushrooms. I had heard about this drug from some of my friends and I decided to start researching the drug. I would have much rather had the N,N DMT, but I took what I could get. After learning enough about it to actually feel a little comfortable with trying it, I found some. I have heard that I could not prepare for this drug and I was looking for perhaps an altered perception with this drug.



Me and my friend C, drove to a friends house to try the astonishing drug. I had heard that vaporizing the drug would be the best way to smoke it so as not to waste the drug. I sprinkled about 5 mgs (eyeballed) into a lightbulb and began to heat it making sure not to use direct flame to conserve the drug. This method was suppose to conserve the drug but I actually ended up wasting about 30 mgs of the drug. C did get one good hit off of the drug and had to lay down for awhile. I was pretty mad at this point and decided to try to find a bowl so I could try a different method. I only had about 5 mgs left with me, so I sprinkled the last dust into the bowl. I lit up the drug and began to suck initially noticing that I had definitely got a hit becuase I could taste the plastic taste which many people describe when smoking the drug. By the time I had let out the smoke I was already starting to trip. I felt like my body was numb. I could hold anything, it was just like I had almost blacked out but I still knew exactly where I was. There was some music playing but I couldn't make out what it was. 



I remembered to stick to the music to make sure that I wouldn't get too far out there. My heart was beating so fast that it actually was hurting me. While my whole body was numb I could feel part of my body starting to move involuntarily. I tried as hard as I could to straighten up at this point, because I didn't want it to get too out of hand. This hard part of the trip last for about 3 mins for me. I have heard of people blacking out but this didn't really happen to me although I did feel disassociated, as if I were not really part of my body. After about 4 mins into the trip I could get up and walk around. Everything was intensified and I couldn't really walk straight for about 15 mins. I was moving around but I didn't notice my surroundings. I could feel my heart beating even faster now. I recommend that if using this drug you shouldn't move for about 20 - 25 mins after your hit. 



About 20 mins after taking the hit I was no longer tripping. I could walk straight and talk to everybody. I was extremely ecstatic though. I had an overwelming joy in me that was undescribable. It was such an intense experience. I wasn't happy becuase I was still alive and I wasn't happy becuase I had just smoked one of the hardest trips in the world, I was just happy. 



Later me and my friend C went back to my house to pick up some more of this amazing drug. The second time that C hit it I didn't. I wanted to see what he looked like with a good direct flame hit in him. He probably smoked about 5 mgs the second time. He looked as if he drifted into a coma for a couple minutes. He would later walk around with bulging eyes for about 20 mins and his perception was still altered. My second time I smoked it that night I had the same experience as the first time, but perhaps not as intense. I was very dissasociated though. The second time I smoked the drug I smoked about another 5 mgs. 



The only clear conclusion that me and C noticed was that this drug put us  out into our own worlds. Somewhere we couldn't describe. It also makes us so happy afterwards, walking around with a smile on smiling and laughing at everything for at least an hour. C said that the little bit that he smoked was worth 100\$ at one point during his trip. This drug should be taken very serious even though I don't believe my experience was as intense as some of the ones I've read. I'm really glad that I researched this drug before I did it, although I don't think anything could have prepared me for what I did. The only thing that dissapointed me about this drug was that it did not have any life profounding effects on me. I was not enlightened at all by the drug which was a primary reason for trying it. One other thing that me and C decided is that this drug is mentally addictive. Me and C did it twice, but then we stopped because we felt as if the drug might fry our brains if we did it a third time or possibly give us a heart attack. It was an amazing experience.
