Yesterday I experienced a mix of anger, confusion, sickness, nausea, physical pain, and delerium that I would wish on no one in this world. I am writing this report just as warning to current users of Yopo and future users in hopes that they take this substance correctly and not make the mistake I did. 



I had 25 Yopo seeds I obtained from an online shop and decided that I wanted to try using them. I ground all of them up in a coffee grinder at once. I usually do not enjoy snorting any substance so I figured I could mix the powder into some water and mask the taste with some fruit juice. This is where I made my mistake\ldots 



After this concoction was finished I took a sip. I shuddered. The taste of these seeds was not bad or even horrible. The best way I could describe the taste is pure evil. It made me get chills to look at and smell this stuff it was so viciously evil and disgusting. I managed to get maybe half the liquid down before I decided that it was not worth the trauma on my stomach. I poured the rest down the drain and went to my couch. Shortly after I began feeling physical pain in my head, arms, and chest and I began to get extremely nauseated. I layed down on my bed and put on some positive music in hopes that I could fight these terrible feelings. I battled the nausea and body pain lying down on my bed for a good hour with the stench and taste lingering in my senses. I finally managed to get to sleep for a couple hours. 



I woke up in the evening with the nausea still present. I got off my bed and started walking and could barely hold myself upright. It was the most intense dizziness I have ever felt and I could not think of a time when my equilebrium was more offset. I got into the bathroom and things around me started turning dark green and I panicked for a good couple minutes. It finally passed and so did the nausea and body sickness that had tortured me for the past hours. I am thankful and honestly surprised that I did not vomit my abdominal cavity out. I cannot even imagine what would have happened if I had drank the entire amount of liquid.



So please, anyone who is considering trying Yopo. DO NOT PUT IT IN LIQUID. Use the insuffalation method. It's tried, and it works. Keep it to that.
