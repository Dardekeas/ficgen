This report isn't so much to describe the effects of tramadol, but to describe one of its uses besides pain killing. Even though it wasn't until I had discovered it on my own, I noticed a few people had mentioned that they had taken tramadol and noticed they didn't feel any withdrawal from their opiates. So on with the story.



Basically I had come into a huge supply of oxycodone and morphine. I had never done any other drug (including marijuana), so to me the effects of any drug were new and amazing. I was a regular user for about 9 months. I would take large doses on the weekend for fun and then trail off during the week. I did this hoping it would slow down my tolerance levels, which with experimenting, I truly think it did. When I neared the end of my opiate supply I was taking nearly 150mg in a sitting just to get the desired opiate high I was looking for. Sometimes I would take 500mg in a day. 



As my supply dwindled I became greatly afraid of running out and going into withdrawal (I had quit cold once before and did not enjoy it). It wasn't so much that I minded getting sick, but what affected me the most was the back pain that came with the opiate withdrawal. I already had back pain from before, which I had forgotten about since I was so heavily medicated. I always knew when the opiates were leaving my body because my back would hurt with intense pain, so much I could barely even walk. A day later with no opiates I would start to get flu like symptoms. Headaches, vomiting, insomnia, pretty much just generally unhappy. 



As my supply was running out, I still had never taken my side supply of tramadol. I didn't know what it was or what it did. After I took my last oxycodone I started to panic. I went online and quickly researched tramadol. It seemed to be safe so I took it in a small dose. I didn't get a high, but I didn't feel uncomfortable either. 



After about 24 hours with no opiates, but with 50mg of Tramadol every 3 hours or so, I was feeling just fine. After further experimenting I discovered that the best dosage for me was 150mg of tramadol every 12 hours or so. I was very impressed with how fast the tramadol would take effect and with how long it would last. I stayed on Tramadol for 2 weeks straight in fear that my opiate withdrawal would not be over. Yet during those two weeks the only withdrawal symptoms I felt were some slight hot and cold flashes. I just want to be very clear that I felt no back pain, no sickness, absolutely nothing besides the hot and cold flashes while going through withdrawal from opiates while taking the tramadol.



I know all people react differently to drugs, but I would have to say that for me, tramadol has become a miracle drug to me. I now have a prescription for tramadol for my back pain. It kicks in quickly and has no noticeable withdrawal symptoms. 



I will never forget how lucky I was to have the tramadol on hand for my withdrawal.
