Snort aprox. 30mg of Methylone. Initial alert felt within 3 minutes, building within 15 to a distinct though quite mild warm glow. Substance seems very easy on the nose, no burn to speak of, and post nasal drip while not enjoyable by no means intolerable. I've yet to ingest orally but assume that this ammount by that route would be essentially inactive. Otherwise very reminiscent of a similar ammount of MDMA by the same route, seems less pusy, gentler though perhaps not euphoric--not necesserialy a bad thing as I've long ceased to enjoy E.



1 h 15 min later I decided to snort an equivalent ammount, since the effects of the first line seem to retreating. While methylone is undoubtedly potentiated by this route, I don't think it's a spectacular potentiation as in the case of 2CB and 2CT7--which are both considerable enhanced when taken in this way. It may be that like MDMA its active intranasaly, but in such a way that it never reveals its full glory. MDMA when snorted in my experience never seems to have the same quality as an oral dose, it  seems more amphetamine like (though all of this is massively subjective).



Second dose has not increased the intensity of the experience, but merely prolonged its effect. Still a nice effect, warm, centered and calm. Look forward to a larger dose orally.
