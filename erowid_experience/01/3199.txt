I have been using DXM for about 5 yrs. now, and it is a wonderful experience. I also had some very weird times as well. Let me talk about the wonderful side of it first and the remarkable visions and trips, voyages, Free-falling like an airplane doing a nose dive and all the other stuff.



I always take it at night because during the day at that level everthing is flanged it is hard to walk. Not to mention when my brain suddenly gets scattered around the universe and then I have to stop (or it appeared) and gather each little piece up and put it back together, it gets a little hard to know where I'm going. 



I would take 2 boxes of coricidin, wait about an hour then drink a bottle of Delsym. After and hour it kicks in then everything starts to become translucent like and I can sense and hear things at the same time. I am already a little physcic and when this happens I just get shot up (phsycicly) into the stratosphere. I mean I know what is on peoples mind and, it seems now, telling people what is going on when they do not have a clue themselves and wonder how the world I knew about it. 



Then I go to dream. Colors galore. I am so out of it I see other rooms, places, worlds, alien environments, contact with other lifeforms-spiritual entites, And have amazing conversations with them. 



I also witness some amazing animated cartoons. Let me describe one of them that I will never forget.



It all started out in/on the ground. A path. Two bullets where chasing a robber. The bullets where white and had points to their heads. Zipping along at REAL fast speeds. And the robber was always just out of their reach. He was gasping for breath because of all the running. Well, the bullets where chasing him for about (it seemed) 25 minutes and then suddenly ran into a stop (wwhich was nothing more than a high wall). Their was a big and loud BANG. The bullets obviosly killed the man they were after. The one bullet got up and said (and I heard this in realtime) `Now where did he go' and the other bullet said `I have absolutley NO idea' and they walked off the stage. 



Another time I had a vision. It was like I was in front of a 101 inch TV about two feet away (now this is in technicolor and live action). I was wittnessing a crash in slow motion in a VERY busy side of a city. Their was this tanker-semi with alot of fuel in it turning the corner and this red small passenger car went smashing into it. And in slow motion the whole time I saw the explosion. The car went in the middle of the tanker-semi, it split in half, dumping all its fuel. Sparks were flying all around and ignited the fuel. Their was this GIGANTIC explosion and I saw it all in super slow motion. 



These are the type of visions I have. Very realistic and like I am actually there wittnessing these events. But, every experience I have is differant, not one is the same. 



Now I will tell about some VERY weird times I had on it. I drank 1 bottle of creomolsion and 1 bottle of delsym. I knew it was and OD but did it anyway. I didn't have alot of visions that night because Of the mind-body load, but the next morning I woke up and found, to my shock and total amazement, that the automatic part of my brain was completly knocked of and I had to assume manuel control. Now THAT is extremely hairy. I had my breathing go off the par too and had to manualy control that too, but that is another experience. I had to be very,very carful of how I thought. The slightest negative thought would shoot my heart rate up, my breathing would become impaired, panic attacks were common. I had to stay on top of that thin line just to keep myself normal. 



After awile, I found that I could control every aspect of my autonomic nervous system. If I thought ny leg would cramp up, it would. My leg would start to tighten up and then I would release it and it would go back to normal. It was amazing and really interesting. I could call up the death sequence and I would feel Hell, halloween, and like a zombie at the same time. Also my heart would race and I would feel death start to sit in. Then I would reverse this and feel relaxed again. Now, all this was happening in my mind. I did not under any circumstances let any one know waht I was experiencing, It was a silent trip that lasted the whole day. It was truly amazing.



I have other experiences to talk about, but for know, I'll stop.



A word of warning: I built up my tolerance to this level over a period of five years and am so used to the effects and delusions and the VERY weird bodily perceptions that I am used to it and it does not bother me. If I had tried these doses initially I would probably have ended up in the hospital thinking I was dying, and in all likelyhood, I would have believed the hallucinations and delusions.  This is an extremely powerful drug.
