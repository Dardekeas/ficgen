Last fall me and some friends put together some money and aquired 15 Rolex Crown E pills.  I hadnt rolled in about 7 months so i figured i was do for a crazy night.  The person we had bought them from told us that they were pretty strong pills and after a quick check online I found them to contain only MDMA (at least i think so, you can never really be sure), which is what i like.  



As soon as I got the pills I chewed up a half (about 10pm), and swallowed the other.  I then made my deliveries to my friends and we made plans to meet in my dorm room and listen to some music and dance a bit.  Once the deliveries were made the first of my pills was starting to come on, so me, being the hedonist i am, decided to munch another one down when i got back to my dorm.  Now all my friends are starting to come up and we are rolling and having a good time.  After about an hour this girl i had met a few weeks prior to this experiance came up and had also eaten a pill and was rolling really hard.  Almost immediately me and her began to make out and hook up\ldots fantasic!  At this point my initial crowd dispersed.  We went at it for a while and then decided that another dose would be great.  We each ate another pill and continued doing what some young adults of opposite sexes do when they roll together.  



After an hour or so of this we went to the kids room who i initially made the purchase from.  His room was another fantastic little dance party, so me and my lady for the night decided to hang out there.  While we were there i got my hands on another half pill and snorted it.  I was ROLLING HARD and it felt GREAT.  This had been one of my favorite drug experiances of all time so far, and i have had alot (pot, acid, shrooms, dxm, and dmt to name a few).  Now she was starting to get worn out so we decided to go back to her dorm and take some ambien to fall asleep easier, this is somewhere b/w 4am and 5am.  10 minutes after taking the Ambien my legs felt heavy and the room looked slanted so i lay down in her bed to fall asleep.  Unfortunately sleep did not come to me that night.  



I can only assume that the mixture of the two drugs caused some strange reaction in my body as i began to have some of the most intense and realistic hallucinations i have ever had.  The walls of the room would disapeer and i would see a desert landscape, i saw a bodyless and grotesquely obese head sliding around a little robot on her desk.  I also saw a little door on the wall that was guarded my a demon type creature who was reluctant to let me see inside, as well as dried flowers that turned into three ballet dancers on the top of the dresser beneath the demon's door.  I could also draw the ceiling towards me and bat it away into particles with a back-handed slap.  The strangest part about all of this is that since i didnt expect it i thought that it was real!! I wasnt freaked out or anything, it was almost like a dream, but i know it was real due to my lady friends story about me the next day.  I stopped hallucinating at around 10am the next morning.  Has anyone ever heard of anything like this or had the same combination with different effects??  



Since then i have rolled twice, both times were relatively normal and involved no hallucinations of any kind.
