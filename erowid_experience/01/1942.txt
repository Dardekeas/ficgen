After reading alt.drugs for a while and checking out the FAQ's at hyperreal.com [Erowid Note: Now available at http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/], I decided to try Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds. I ordered 100 from Of The Jungle (\$10). All of the information on Morning Glories and HBWR is pretty contradictory. The extraction sounded a bit questionable, so I decided to risk the nausea and just use water/lemon juice as one netter suggested.



I started with six seeds. There wasn't any `white coating' on them like the faqs had implied. They looked like tan chocolate chips. I washed them to be sure. They were ground in a pepper grinder, then placed in an 8oz Ball jar with $\sim$3oz of lemon juice and $\sim$3 of water and shaken occasionally for the next two hours. Most of the articles said to strain it through a coffee filter, but it wouldn't go through so I used a papertowel and funnel, which worked pretty well. I added sugar and it was like a weedy lemonade, slightly foul. 



A buddy of mine dropped by about then. While we talked I felt the nausea come on. It wasn't too bad so I decided to wait it out rather than barf. After $\sim$45 it subsided into the backround and I was feeling really buzzed. It was kind of like a sine wave building and receding every few minutes and I felt pretty speedy. We walked over to some friends' house. My pupils were dilated as hell so I could see really well in the dark. It was a strange sensation. Once there, I was feeling both speedy and kind of drowsy, like I'd taken half a hit with a good bowl. This lasted for about 4 hours and the nausea faded away. We walked back and I could still see in the dark pretty well. I was almost down, but felt fantastic. By then it had been 7 hours since I'd drunk the `lemonade'. We ate pizza and watched television for an hour or so, then crashed. I had a little trouble falling asleep, but slept soundly when I did and the next morning I felt great. All in all a damn nice time, well worth the nausea (and only cost \$.60!).



The next weekend, a local music festival was going on, a perfect time to try them again. This time it was only five seeds and instead of straining them, I put the ground seeds in a sealable tea bag, but otherwise the methodology was the same. I drank it around noon and the nausea hit almost immediately. This time it was nasty, about like motion sickness. I rode it out, but probably should have barfed. Again, it only lasted about 45 minutes, but they were ugly. An hour after I took them I felt much better and we (my girlfriend) decided to go to the show. The walk there was `interesting'. I was buzzing quite nicely and the nausea was way in the backround. I felt pretty the same as before, speedy and somewhat stoned. We walked around for a bit and my girlfriend decided to go to a nearby restaurant. They took twenty minutes to fix her food, so I sat outside watching traffic. 



After a few minutes, thing started to get weird. One of the buildings was breathing and I completely track of time. I started getting confused. Nothing specific, just not quite right. By the time she'd gotten her food, I was flying. We started back to the show, but a few blocks later I felt an extreme need to sit somehwere quiet, preferably home, so we headed back. Things got ugly fast. All of a sudden I felt lost and incredibly depressed. I kept in mind that it was just the drug, and maintained until we got home. I didn't want my girlfriend to realize how bad it was and worry her so I just kept quiet and played it cool, which worked. As soon as we got home, I sat in my reliner and turned on a local accustic station and started to feel more normal, but I was still pretty depressed and felt terrible about myself and the nausea had gotten worse. 



For the next three hours as long I was talking, listening or concentrating on something, I was OK. If I started to drift, things got weird. My girlfriend left for work without noticing how bad I was. I was still flying, but tired so I sort of fell asleep. I dreamed that I was walking on a cold shore and there were treeless hills in the backround, like moors. I was talking to someone, as we walked, but never got a clear picture of them. After a bit, the person turned and shoved me backwards and I woke up suddenly, feeling like I'd been dropped into the chair from above. I was weirded out, but felt better. Still tired, though, so I lay down and slept for a couple of hours. After than I was still tripping slightly, but not too bad. I was really ready for it to end. It was another two hours, before it wore off completely. About 8 hours since I drank the stuff. Again, I felt great and hungry, but a little shaken as well. I'm glad that I hadn't taken more, or I would have really freaked. Not one of my better experiences overall. 



Do they work? Damn right.Will I do them again? Yeah, at least once more. Next time I will try the extraction outlined in the MG faq. Part of the problem with mixed reactions, I believe, has to do with potency of each individual seed. The way I intend on getting even doses is to start with 30-40 seeds and adjust doses as portions of that to even out the LAA levels.
