Well, some of you may or may not know about this whole phenazepam craze that started cause it was marketed as `liquid xanax' if you did a little chemistry with high proof alcohol. But it was sent as powder cause it's pure. 



I ordered 100mg for like \$13 and was real safe with it at first. I would just lick a little bump after a lot of smoking or drinking. It literally is an anti-anxiety drug. But it's just that. Anti-anxiety. Well not much recreational purpose there. 



But still I kept it in my wallet for like a month until one night I was at work and I mixed at least 8-10mg mixed with water. And I did that every other hour starting at 2:00 that morning. I remember being relieved and walking out the sliding doors and into the sun. Then I was in an ambulance. Then in the hospital. Then spent 3 days on my bed. Now I'm getting sent to rehab and I freaked EVERYONE out. 



When they say be careful with it - BE CAREFUL WITH IT. I was soon to be homeless, I was broke, and having bad problems with my girl so I just did it. I'm flying to the east coast to start rehab later today.
