[Erowid Note: The term `yopo' is traditionally used in reference to Anadenanthera peregrina. Recently many people have started using it to refer to both A. peregrina AND A. colubrina. This report specified only `yopo' so we do not know the exact identity of the seeds used.]





After researching for a good source of DMT and 5meodmt for extraction, I found a website with a large amount of yopo seeds for a good price.  After getting the package I decided i would try smoking the seeds straight without the use of extraction just to test things out.  I peeled the shell off of the seeds and cut up and crushed as much of the material as possible (next time i'd recommend a coffee grinder).  I then smoked the seeds through a water bong.  





I got about 2 hits before i started feeling the effects, and i wasn't even through with the bowl yet.  My face all of a sudden felt very hot and was tingling.  I suddenly got extremely nauseous and ran outside to throw up.  I ended up not throwing up but instead sat down in the grass and started enjoying the trip.  I had cev's and patterning and a very pleasant feelings overall.  The effects lasted about 10 minutes and then came down slowly after that.  I would say it was about a ++, very pleasant and worth the nausea.
