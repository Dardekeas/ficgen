My boyfriend and I took the capsules.  About 30-45 minutes later I started vomiting and getting hot flashes.  Let me just add that we took this drug with an open mind, without high expectations.  After I was finally done vomiting my brains out, I went and sat on the couch and watched TV.



I started getting this amazing burst of energy, I did not know what to do with myself.  It was awful.  My boyfriend also had the same feelings of uncontrollable energy.  We proceeded to try and go for a walk and I still felt like shit so we just decided to go home and watch TV and wait until the effects of the drug wore off.  THIS DRUG WAS THE WORST DRUG I HAVE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.



The trip was like coming down off of a dirty acid trip without the crazy thoughts or hallucinations.  Now being an acidhead, 5-MeO-DiPT drove me insane, I kept on waiting for the drug to peak, and I kept on saying is this it?  I finally came down off of the drug and I couldn't sleep.



I am not sure if I had bad effects due to the setting that my boyfriend and I were in or if it just sucked.  There is really something missing in this drug and I would like to consult the makers on it.  All in all I will never ever do 5-MeO-DiPT again and I truly advise against it.
