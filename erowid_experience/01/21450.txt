To begin with, i'll give my drug history: I am 22, and have been taking LSD, mushrooms, smoking pot, and drinking since I was 17. I have dabbled in other drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, and mescaline, but that's unimportant. I've taken hallucinogens with some regularity, especially in high school and early college, when I tripped at least once a month, with a few gaps of three or four months, but lately I've found good hallucinogens hard to get. So I got some HBWR seeds and syrian rue. 



I ground up the rue and swallowed it, and followed that with 11 seeds. I was surprised that about 15 minutes after ingestion the room began to glow and pulsate and shimmer, just like 15 minutes after dropping acid. I felt lethargic, heavy, like I'd just eaten a huge undercooked burger, but I felt the wierd psychedelic stupor-weight that comes with mushrooms early on. In retrospect I believe this was all harmaline working on me, judging from what I've read of its onset time and effects. The first two hours were spent watching a clock, telling myself `I'll puke in 5 minutes, I just have to keep it down for 5 minutes.' After I realized that it had been in me for 2.5 hours and that I was tripping `balls' as they say, I excused myself and went into the bathroom. I puked immediately and intensely, more intensely than I have ever puked in my life. My blood pressure skyrocketed and my whole body burnt with a cold sting. I could taste the tiny bits of rue in my mouth, which made me puke more. My vision spiraled into a nightmare kaleidoscope, than I thought `hey, you just puked. You're not freaking out, it's not the drug, you never feel good when you're puking'. 



I laid down on the floor and breathed for a few minutes. The moment I began this activity I felt a million times better. I felt as light as the ether, no more raw beef to hold me to this mortal coil. I jumped up and brushed my teeth and burst back into my living room, ranting to my friend about being purged of all evil and sin and whatnot, and from there on out it was a fun informative trip. We walked around outside in the snow, and my yard looked like the frozen world of Endor miles below me. The bushes and trees in my garden looked like exploding fireworks frozen in the moment of climax. Later on we watched a clockwork orange with Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and Animals (in that order) for a soundtrack. It was amazing\ldots PRT Deltoid (alex's truant officer) appears with the sleazy Have a Cigar and pulls alex's hair back, cruelly muttering `and did we tell you the name of the game, boy?' in his ear. The thematic relations worked amazingly, and I realized many things about the movie that had gone unnoticed for years.



I tried this same combination a month later, but the results were scarier, due almost solely to the fact that, for purely circumstantial reasons, I felt distant from my girlfriend, emotionally\ldots anyway, I was watching Nosferatu with the Delgado's new album as a soundtrack, and the brilliant cinematography of the film combined with the despair-laden lyrics like `hate is all you need' made me feel like all of the seething emotions of the world were all around me, engulfing me. I had to turn the music and movie off because I felt as if I was drowning in this mess, especially when, for a split second, I truly and honestly believe that I mentally and emotionally transformed into my girlfriend, and directly experienced her pain. It freaked me out. After that I chilled out, smoked some dope, and went for a walk in my back yard. Then, a youthful enthusiasm siezed me, I grabbed my coveralls and a sled. I went sledding, then lay on my back on a frozen pond (terrified it would crack but knowing home was a minute away). The park looked like a japanese painting, all white, just a slight whisp of a brush stroke to indicate a leaveless winter tree. 



So those are what I feel to be the important facts of my HBWR-huasca experiences so far. I have tried HBWR alone, a week after my first combo trip, but I fear I didn't space the two far enough apart\ldots I got a weak trip, so I got drunk and high on top of it. It was great fun, but I don't think I need to go into that. 



This is dirt cheap (about \$1.50 per trip by my records) and legal, so I say fuck breaking my back looking for street hallucinogens that may or may not be real, I've had great luck with HBWR and San Pedro cactii.
