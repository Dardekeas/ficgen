T:0

mCPP down the hatch\ldots  bad taste\ldots  almost sour and bitter at the same time. Not bad if mixed with Gatorade.



T:15

Light nausea onset, not unbearable but uncomfortable. Pupils beginning to dilate. Everything seems bright. 



T:30 

Strong nausea, vomiting. There goes a good lunch.



T:40

Hunched over the toilet vomiting again.



T:60 

Nausea has completely subsided and now I am beginning to finally enjoy the experience. 



T:80

Pupils highly dilated. Everything seems to be moving slightly. The farther away the object of focus the greater the movement. Looking outside provides an almost earthquake like feeling. A mild paranoia is also beginning to set in. It feels like someone is in the room with me when no one actually is.



T:100

Earlier regrets and feelings of ``why did I do this'' have completely gone out the window. It feels great. I feel happy without a care in the world. Its incredible. 



T: 2 hrs 

Beginning to worry as I have to be at work in 30 minutes and I have still not come down. Paranoia greatly increased by this worry. Still feeling good over this worry/paranoia.



T: 2hr15min

Time to head to work and still flying. Everything outside looks amazing as I walk through the grass, looking down into the grass, everything seems to become greener as I progress, eventually becoming a glowing neon green. 2 cigarettes help to ease any worry about going into work. 



T: 2hr30min

Arrive at work. To my surprise the only symptom that I am unable to control is the incredible dilation of my eyes and some occasional jitters. Other than that work actually became quite enjoyable in this state (by saying this I do not recommend that anyone goes into work after taking mCPP or any other drug, ultimately I regret doing it).



T:3hr30min

Finally coming down. Euphoria less noticeable. Mild headache coming on. 



T:4hr

Effects of drug, other than eye dilation, have all but disappeared. Headache strengthening. 



T:5hr 

Eyes back to normal. Headache almost unbearable. A few advil taken to ease the headache. After I got past the initial nausea it is all worth it.
