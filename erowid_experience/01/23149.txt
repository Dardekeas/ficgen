One day while very very desperate to `get high'. I decided to go through my moms medicine cabinet. All she had was flexeril and paxil. Flexeril is a muscle relaxant, and I've taken them before, and it did absolutely nothing, pretty much the same goes for paxil. 



I decided I would try and snort it, and maybe I would get some effects. BAD IDEA. I have snorted quite a few different things\ldots ranging from speed and morphine, to vicodin and codeine. Anyhow, after snorting the paxil pill (approx. 2 lines) my whole side of my head started throbbing with a pain I have never felt before in my life. My eyes started tearing and turned all red, it looked like I had been crying for an hour. I lay on my bed holding my head for a good 15-20 minutes until the pain subsided. It did not do a single thing except cause extreme pain and my eyes seemed to be a bit more dilated than before. I would not recommend paxil to anyone looking to get high, because it did not work, and was EXTREMELY painful to snort.
