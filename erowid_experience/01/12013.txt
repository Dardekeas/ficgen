Tonight I was in one of my more experimental moods, and after determining that my supply of psychedelic substances was quite obviously zilch I decided to try snorting one of my 50mg Zoloft pills.



To be blunt - aside from the expected mood lift, the experience was rotten. There was a burn that initially was very calm - I have felt a similar burn with insufflated vicodin, and I can deal with it.



However, as time passed, the burn intensified. Soon my eyes began watering and my nose was running. I began to sneeze and was feeling generally very uncomfortable.



I decided to take a shower, and sat in there for 30 minutes in the steam to help my nasal passages. I did as much as I could to clean out my nose.



I am writing this now an hour and a half after insufflation. My nose is still agitated as is my throat. In my experience, insufflation is really a hit and miss crapshoot. I'm writing this on the off chance someone else might decide to take the same path I did - hopefully I'll save them a night of annoying nose problems.
