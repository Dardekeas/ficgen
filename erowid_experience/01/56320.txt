I want to share with anyone out there an experience that I had way back when, and haven't really had the chance to tell anyone about. Mostly because I forgot about it until just recently. First though I'll give you a short introduction.



Years ago when I had first started my journey in to drugs I never imagined I would be enveloped in the crazy world that I ended up in. I did know that I would try anything that came my way as long as I knew everything I possibly could about it though. I went through various drugs starting in my early teens, but my drug of choice ended up being Ecstacy. After 6 months or so of delving in to the world of raves, parties, and ecstacy I had become quite experienced but also careless. The more I partied the more drugs I began to consume at a now understood, alarming rate. 



After a weekend of actually partying sober and trying to stay up with friends who were on speed, mdma, and weed I was totally exhausted. We just got back from another run to the store and my friends were spinning records in the living room. I was thinking about heading to bed because I simply didn't have the strength to be up any longer. My friend A offered a hit of a joint before I headed to bed and I was happy to take it. Just as I was making my way to a room to crash in our friend L showed up with a new batch of tabs called Blue Armanis. L was feeling generous and asked if anyone wanted to try the new stuff. In the back of my mind I knew I should have just gone to sleep, in the back of my mind I knew the better thing to do would be just to get the tab and save it for later. It's funny how excitement can override common sense isn't it?



I took a tab from L as did everyone else, and everyone kept on with what they were doing. I told L that I'm going to take a quick nap and to wake me up in about 30 minutes if he didn't mind. He said fine so I went to the room and crashed hard the second I hit the bed. The next thing I know I'm having the most vivid and incredible dreams I've had to date. Apparently L forgot about me asking him to wake me up and I ended up sleeping and woke up as I was starting to peak. I woke feeling like the sexiest man in the world, and amazingly I woke up with a rock hard erection. I laid back in the bed and stretched like anyone does when they first wake up, but I felt as though my arms and legs would shoot through the walls. I felt like my penis was going to explode. 



Reluctantly I got up and checked to see who was around still and why they didn't wake me up. I began to get the telltale euphoria but it kicked in all at once with no warning. With the biggest shit eating grin ever I walked in to the living room and gave my friend Kt a hug from behind. She squeeled with excitement and turned around to see that it was me. Her face was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, and was to distracted to notice I still had an erection. She looked down and as she did I remembered and almost became embarassed until she kissed me and took me back to the room. I'll spare the details but suffice it to say this was the most mindblowing sex I've ever had. 



Afterwards we cuddled, talked, and by then I was starting to come down. I told her what had happened and she didn't believe me until we got up and she found L. As it turns out he had to run to get rid of the rest of what he had given us and forgot to tell someone else about me. I didn't mind though, and actually thanked him and gave him a huge hug, sans the erection this time. Kt and I told everyone good night and went back to bed to cuddle and fall asleep. 







I don't suggest anyone try to mimic this because I honestly have no clue if it was a healthy thing to do. To this day I've never tried to do that again, but have had less than equal experiences with opiates and sleeping. I don't think anything can quite compare to waking up and already be peaking on some really good ecstacy.
