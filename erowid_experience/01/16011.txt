In preparation for my second MDA experience I tried not to do any other drugs the preceding week.  Mostly this meant not using my prescription Xanax or Valium, as Benzodiazepines tend to decrease the intensity of hallucinogens.

 

My goal was to take the MDA with a friend who I am very comfortable with.  However, she was feeling anxious and having massive headaches that evening.  So she and I intended to have a fun time together while only I took the MDA.  I had received the MDA from a reliable source (as I had the last time) and took a dose of roughly 100mg.

 

There was an hour before I started to feel any of the effects.  But within 30 minutes of the first inklings, I was at the plateau where I remained for four or five hours.  That first 30 minutes I felt slightly nauseas, but I have been experiencing this more frequently lately and I can not be certain how severe the nausea would normally have been.



During the trip, we watched Hitchcock's film `North by Northwest' for the first time.  During any standard trip I would not have been able to follow the plot.  However, due to Hitchcock's masterful use of suspense and the Amphetamines, I was glued to my seat in rapt attention for the whole two hours.  From evidence such as this, and my first trial with MDA, I feel MDA is a psychotropic but not a psychedelic.  However, I do know people who like it for its ability to greatly lengthen the empathenogenic effects of MDMA.



Over the five-hour peak I had some mild psychedelic effects, but nothing at all substantial either in thoughts or senses.  But for about ten hours after the initial effects began I felt a strong Amphetamine quality.  I have done a good range of Amphetamines, with no particular regularity, and this is my least favorite.  I had a psychedelic experience equivalent to half a standard dose of LSD and an anxiety response equivalent to about four doses of LSD.  I find this to be its major downfall, but if you like Ritalin or Methamphetamine (for fun not studying) you would probably love MDA.



The day after this experience I was nervous and had a lot of lower back pain form MDA-based muscle tension. I am a curious psychotropic explorer, but I will probably just give the rest of my MDA away.
