K2 purchased from a website



Supposedly, K2 contains a proprietary blend of herbs and extracts including: `Canavalia rosea, Clematis vitalba, Nelumbo nucifera, Pedicularis grandifolia, Heimia salicifolia, Leonurus sibiricus and Ledum palustre.'



However, I assume that there is a synthetic cannabinoid in it, based on the same being true for other `legal highs', and the few reports I have read about K2. 



Please read about my background in consciousness exploration, including my use of yoga, fasting, and psychedelics, by reading the background described in some of my experience reports on Erowid, located here: 

http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?A=ShowAuthor\&ID=355.



Briefly: I have smoked marijuana for 23 years, and have around 100 psychedelic experiences in that time, including strong LSD, mushroom, Ayahuasca, smoked DMT, and salvia experiences. 



I am living in a place where marijuana is illegal, and the penalties for possession are severe.  For this reason, I have been exploring legal highs for the past 18 months.  I have tried, most notably, Spice Gold/Diamond (which seem identical to me) and Magic Silver/Gold (which seem to have identical effects to me).  I like them all, but Spice lasts too long for me for many occasions (6 hours), and Magic Silver/Gold seem to be quite hard on my body, including sending my pulse up and making me feel as if my blood pressure is elevated (no way to check this). I also had a bad experience mixing Magic and another legal high called Dream, though I suspect it was primarily due to an overly high dosage of Magic (this is described in one of my Erowid experience reports: http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=79488). Magic products last 3 hours, which is a better length of experience for me, since I am busy and only indulge after work, and I can't afford to stay awake as late as Spice forces me to.



No prescription medications taken in years.  Recently, I have taken fairly large doses of vitamin C (2 grams a day). I have been taking Co Q10 (30-60 mg/day) recently as well.  



Recovering from a cold, though I am still only 50\% back to normal.  I exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. I am generally in very good health. 

 

K2 Blonde - first experience

Prior to ingesting

Physical: I am nauseous from having eaten heavy food, and still being slightly sick with a cold. Low on energy.

Mental: Excited to try a new substance, good spirits, hoping that the K2 helps with the nausea, gives me energy and creativity, and lasts a relatively short time, as I have read it does. 



4:07 PM. Vaporized one large hit of a single 0.05 g `bud'. Held it in for as long as possible -- more than 30 seconds. 

Initial reaction: immediate bliss. 

Very high, extremely similar to a marijuana high. 

I am listening to music I recently made, and it sounds amazing -- I am hearing it as if for the first time, despite having listened to it 50 times over the past week. I can visualize the relationships between the instruments better than I had previously been able to do. 

Pulse is 78, higher than average (roughly 65), but I am also recovering from a cold.  

Time dilation.

I am very present in the moment, subjectively.  Highly enlightened. 



4:20 I feel pretty much exactly as if I had just smoked a large bong rip (or two) of high-quality marijuana (which is all I need to get fully high).  Balance may be slightly affected, but relatively untouched.  Hint of confusion.  No nausea at all. Yes!



4:30 I am being incredibly open and caring with family members.  Surprising myself that I could ever be any other way (though I sometimes am). However, this openness is truly something wonderful.  My intellect is engaged, and I can think of ways to phrase things that are supportive of people. 



4:53 possible slight lessening of effects?  I still feel great.  



5:38 definite slight lessening of effects.  I have been having a great time, but the intensity has slipped a notch. Still pleasantly stoned. I ate some mushroom pasta I made.  Tasted really good!  Pulse is down to 72, feels subjectively like I am back to normal.  (It never was a real problem at all, but was noted in an effort to gain objective knowledge about this substance. )



5:57 I am still high, but somewhat less so, and feeling tired.  This might be normal, since I am still getting over a cold, or the K2 might have made me more tired.  Not sure.  Having read the scant information about K2 online, I had expected a shorter experience, but I am pleased. I feel sufficiently high that I expect effects to continue for at least another hour or so.  In other words, I am still pleasantly high. This is good.



6:13 Still going nicely.  Eating roasted chestnuts.  Wonderful!  Interacting with my kids.  Very good feelings. 



6:50 I am halfway down, or more. Back to nearby consensus reality, with just a slight twist.  The high lasted more than 2.5 hours.  Excellent.  I am somewhat tired, but not overly so.  Music still sounds slightly heightened.  Pulse is 69.  This experience felt relatively easy on my body -- easier than smoking marijuana, though it didn't last as long.  I feel as if I could go to sleep now, if I tried, though my mind is slightly sped up, as it gets with marijuana.  

I have eaten too much food.  But I still feel good!



7:20 A slight buzz remains. I certainly wouldn't feel impaired if I wanted to drive at this point (though I was never more impaired, as far a driving ability, than as if I had gotten very high on marijuana). 



Conclusion: I felt enhanced creativity, ability to make connections, time dilation, pleasure listening to music, pleasure eating food, pleasure and openness when talking to my family, and some general euphoria.  Some small energy boost was present. No ``couch-lock''.  

Little body load, other than a pleasant feeling. Nausea was cured instantly.

Probably some tiredness at the end -- in other words, using this stuff took something out of me.  But it was definitely worth it.



K2 was more like Magic Silver/Gold than Spice, due to the intensity of the high (strong) and the duration (about 3 hours), but it seemed more gentle on my body.  



For my purposes -- enhancing creativity and an energy boost at night, after work, when I want to be able to get to sleep at a reasonable time -- this material seems ideal.  I am very happy to have met you, K2!



This is great stuff!
