Amounts were eyeballed.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\#  



T 0 - approximately 8mg nasal 



T 2 - approximately 10mg oral as I wanted to feel more.



T 9 - fairly sober, asleep after one hour.



I eyeballed the dosages.. so it could be less (was careful with it), but as intoxicated as I was, I feel like I was spot on.



At home with a mate it started. Then went to a hardcore party (rave) .. First I hesitated just because the substance would be psychedelic, but because I've read in several reports it was quite `party-worthy' I still did it.

And I have no regrets :)



Whole evening was great. It felt after a few hours as if I saw myself from outside. A bit like mushrooms but without mindfuck.



The laser lights were extremely beautiful, fascinating. Very trippy. (it felt like a combo of mdma / mushies)



It was visualy psychedelic. The warping of vision was like on an average dose of mushrooms. (but only when I really tried to focus on it)



Empathy, I felt sorry for some people because the looked so insanely fuckedup (like unhealty). Too much mdma and too hot inside.



I saw some people having a bade vibe. As if I could really see what was missing in one's thinking, I tried to fix it and succeeded multiple times.



I should add that there have been drinking (one beer p / hour or so), more fresh drinks and smoked. Also smoked a litte cannabis beforehand.



Hour or 7 pips go this morning, and now I feel hard not broke, except hunger, pain and a sprained ankle) (half the time I was partying my feet off! And failed doing some dance move :P )



Well .. that was it. I hope it's a bit of a cohesive story.
