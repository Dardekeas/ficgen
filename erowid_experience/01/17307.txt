I picked up a bottle of St. John's Wort extract from a health food store on a whim.  I didn't really expect to get much out of it.  The next morning, I dropped roughly 60 to 70 drops of the stuff in a tablespoon of warm water.  The bottle said to take 40 to 50. I downed it, quickly, I might add.  Like most herbal supplements, this stuff tastes vile.  Afterwards, I headed off to class.



I was surprised to find that the effects were actually noticable.  Within the half hour after consumption, I could feel a quite noticable lift in my mood.  At the same time, I felt more open to others.  For the first time since classes had begun I found myself eager to talk to the other people in my class before instruction began.  



I was pretty relaxed, and my body was a little slow, but fortunately I didn't really need to move around too much, being that I was in school.  I was surprised to find that while my body had become somewhat sluggish, my mind was just the opposite.  Let me tell you, I've always had a hard time paying attention to lectures, but thanks to my new friend Johnny, my ability to concentrate was easily twice as powerful.  That morning, class wasn't quite the chore that it usually is it sit through.



The full `trip' lasted about two and a half hours.  It's hard to tell exactly when it ended because it fades out very slowly.  My mood stayed elevated even after I could feel the effects wear off, but it wasn't as blatant.  I took another dose of equal size later that day and achieved identical effects.  I slept very well that night, too.



As far as mood and openness with this plant goes, I would liken it to a very mild dose of MDMA.  I've heard that it doesn't work this effectively with all people, but I highly recommend giving it a chance, because a good Johnny trip is easily worth the price of admission.  I look forward to using this new ally to help through a potentially rough day.
