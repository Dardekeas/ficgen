I am a 27 year old male in good health, weighing 195 pounds.  I exercise regularly, eat well and take Wellbutrin (bupropion) for depression under the supervision of a doctor.  I have taken most of the more common psychedelics multiple times and am familiar and comfortable with ``higher'' doses but I profess no unusual tolerance and don't really care to push the limits of what my mind can withstand.



I swallowed the 20mg in a capsule by myself on a weekend afternoon at my home.  I'm not sure what type of salt was in the capsule (acetate, fumarate?)  I nearly always trip alone which some would consider foolish or reckless but this is how I prefer to trip as other people tend to annoy, confuse, or distract me while tripping (maybe I just haven't tripped with the right people but the fact remains).  Of course there's always the danger of a ``bad trip'' but I've had some trips go terribly wrong alone and I've learned to steer experiences in another direction if I'm starting to lose control and how to cope if I start freaking out.



The come-up on the substance was the first thing I was not prepared for.  It was fast.  Not Salvia or DMT fast but quicker than most substances I've taken.  After about an hour I was tripping far harder than on 3.5g of any mushrooms I've ever had.



The visuals on this substance I can only describe as incredible.  Everything definitely has that animated, rounded mushroom quality to it but the intensity was far higher.  The floor was just flowing and undulating like a large body of water on a windy day.  The walls were shifting from squares and stretching themselves into parallelograms back and forth.  Every object in the room moving but they appeared normal.  They were only moving in relationship to one another and the as if some sort of telekinesis pushing everything around randomly.  The whole situation was so absurd that I couldn't help but just giggle and stare as the room did its little dance for me.



At this point I knew I had gotten myself into a much, much stronger experience than I was expecting and I began to get a bit anxious as I was trying to steel myself for the unexpected not knowing how much further I was going to be taken.  What had particularly attracted me to this substance was the reports of the low amount of body load it caused.  This turned out not to be so true in my case.



It started with these strange nerve tingles wrapping around my body.  The best way I can describe it is this:  ever touched a lighter to a pair of socks while wearing them to watch the little fuzzy fibers ignite and spread the front of ignition around the sock in a ring?  Imagine the tingle of a limb that was just beginning to fall asleep doing that passing like that around your body.  It wasn't an unpleasant sensation but it was unexpected and the random nature of where it was a bit unwanted.  I also began to feel a tightness in my chest and became nearly unaware of air going into my lungs.  The inability to feel my own breathing is one physical effect that always makes me anxious and is one of the main reason I do not like dissociatives because I can never relax without the biofeedback of knowing I'm breathing.  Then the tightness in my chest became a acute pressure which felt as if someone was pushing the spine of a book onto my chest but from the inside.



Things were getting nearly out of control at this point.  I did not like the physical sensations I was getting and the open eye visuals were so intense.  Objects were morphing and changing colors completely every two or three seconds and expanding and contracting. On acid and mushrooms certain things seem to have more potential for visuals especially things with lights or patterns.  On this substance EVERYTHING was moving even out of the corner of my eye.   



I decided that I needed to get up and move around to prove to myself by body was fine and sort of grab the devil by the horns so to speak and embrace the crazy new world I was in.  I turned on some music and found myself with the most overwhelming desire to dance I've ever had in my life.  I don't like dancing, I'm not good at it, but I had a blast just dancing around slowly grooving to the music for about an hour.  My body felt amazing when it was moving that it was bordering on euphoric.



At this point I was starting to come down a bit maybe four or five hours after taking the pill.  I was no where near sober but it was becoming obvious that I was returning to baseline.  Interestingly enough the visuals were still going strong.  Everything was still moving but moving more slowly and with a smaller ``range'' of motion.  The colors of things were not changing any longer and objects weren't morphing and expanding and contracting any longer.  I went outside for awhile which I wish I had had the presence of mind to do earlier but it was enjoyable none-the-less.  I was nearly sober at this point and I took a shower and prepared a light meal.



In conclusion, this was one of most ``fun'' substances I've taken.  There was no nausea.  There were no ``mind load'' and I was relatively clear-headed even at the peak.  The only part I didn't like were the physical sensations but once I stopped just sitting there watching the world ``dance'' and joined it by dancing myself those feelings went away.  It was almost like the opposite of motion sickness.  If I were to describe the experience briefly to people that had never taken it before I would say the following:  this was what I thought acid would be like when all I knew about acid came from movies and TV and brief descriptions of ``hard drugs'' in health class.
