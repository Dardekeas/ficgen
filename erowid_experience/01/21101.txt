Several weeks ago, I came across a few blotters of fentanyl, 150ug each.  Excited at the prospect of trying my first opiate other than blue lotus, I decided to ingest my first blotter two days later.



My friend and I were on our way to the theater to see the new Tolkien movie, The Two Towers, when I popped my blotter in my mouth and swallowed it down.  The taste was bitter and unpleasant.  About 30 minutes later and just barely into the movie, a mellow, easy kind of feeling seeped its way into me.  The effect was quite mild, but more noticeable than blue lotus and not quite as happy.  In fact, any positive mood lift was very much secondary to the sedative effects of the drug.  I'm not too sure how long these effects lasted since the movie was distracting me, but by the time it ended, I couldn't detect any more of the drug.



The second time around, I decided to take the blotter sublingually, hoping to feel the fentanyl a little stronger.  The environment was a tolerably loud drinking party at my house.  As for my physical background, I was highly sleep deprived after three weeks of disturbed rest, and I hadn't eaten in several hours.  At 9ish I held the blotter under my tongue and swallowed any excess saliva, despite the taste.  In less than 20 minutes, the opiate hit me in a wave and I felt a detectable loosening of muscles and leadening of flesh.  Ten minutes later, I had trouble standing, my head was spinning, and all I wanted was to lie down somewhere.  I sat down on a recliner for some amount of time--I have no idea how long--and let the heaviest of the dizziness pass.



When I felt a little more coherent and stable, maybe two hours or less later, I noticed the effects rapidly lessening.  Now, the party was barely halfway through and I didn't want to feel sober anytime soon, so I went to one of the serving rooms and grabbed a small alcoholic drink and downed it.  I was hoping the mix of chemicals would potentiate my experience, but I barely felt any changes.  I guess that wasn't enough alcohol to help things along.



By midnight, I felt mostly sober, even after the addition of a nitrous balloon and two hours later the effects were no longer detectable.



Like the last time, there was little mood lift and mostly sedative effects, although quite a bit stronger than the time before.  If I'm looking for fun, I'd probably choose blue lotus over fentanyl.
