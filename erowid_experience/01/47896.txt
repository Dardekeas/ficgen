Well I have been experimenting with a few different compounds lately and I got the idea to combo these two together. I had tried both before (2c-i more so). 5MEO-AMT just seemed like a stairway to nowhere for me. I had taken up to 15 mg previously no vomitting like normal visuals were extremely mild light headache towards the end and of course the whole cracked out when will it end bit. 2C-I on the other hand I've had far more amazing experiences on. All in all a wonderful compound with a great spectrum of abilities. this is what happens when I combine both.



3pm t+0:00 consume 20 mg of 5MEO-AMT



t+0:30 can already feel the first twinges of come on. It always hits me surprisingly fast usually by ten minutes I get the first alert



t+2:00 on the ride up no visuals but gi distress becomes prevalent. I throw up a matter of seconds later. What a disgusting mix of junkfood to throw up (all I had eaten all day).



t+3:00 come up is finished gi stress dissipates. Ever so slight visuals when I look at patterns in the ceiling and carpet they move upon concentration. Amplification of colors is far more prevalent.



t+4:15 get out my pre measured dose of 2C-I (25 mg) and freebase it out of double wrapped tinfoil. This is a great way to do 2C-I even normally. Effects with 5 minutes with an average 5-6 hour duration. I lie down on the couch afterwards and the move and twisting of pre existing patterns becomes more prevalent. Color amplification becomes more prevalent. greens reds and blues look fantastic.



t+6:50 visuals begin to ramp up color amplification is even better plus the nice bonus: 2C-I really calms down all the nasty side effects gi tract distress and other symptoms of 5MEO-AMT. All in all it seriously mellows the cracked out feeling on it and makes it far more manageable to go for the big 20 hour duration.



t+7:50 Take another dose of 2C-I (15mg oral) a few minutes afterwards visuals reach their most spectacular point. Not really so much the twisting bending morphing kind (in fact most of that has subsided). Color amplification is spectacular though. Probably some of the best pure color distortion and light remodulation I have had off any drug or combo. Conversation has been easy through the whole thing (I've been alone with my gf the whole time) great thought stimulation and energy/chakra levels have been through the roof for a lot of it. 



This would be a superb combo for extended meditation, channeling, or chakra realignment. My energy levels are at some intense levels. I can literally feel the energy welling up inside me and pouring out my eyes and mouth.



t+8:45 height of peak achieved. Visuals are very nice nothing all too intense but lots of pretty colors (tv lighting up a room works great for this)



t:13:00 finally visuals begin to dimmer down a lot energy levels are still high but I could force myself to sleep after some struggle at this point thought process is superb mental imaging works great through much of this (definitely the 2C-I doing this). GI stress is minimal but slightly resurfacing. Nothing I wouldnt be able to ignore.



t+15:00 visuals nearly completely subsided still altered fairly well.



t+16:00 decide to go to bed (at 8am) sleep comes with little effort but I wake up now and then through the morning (can go back to sleep just as easy). Dreams throughout sleep are fairly strange with stronger imagery than normal. Altogether nice dreams with bizarre twists.



t+22:00 wake up and there is still a slight twinge of alteration but I'm on the fringe of being at baseline. GI stress is back a little (my stomach gets funky with 2C-I the next day usually)



t+23:30 back to baseline



All in all a superb combo. Visuals combine well. Ill side effects are crossed out by 2C-I and I wake up refreshed on top of it (still needed a nap later on). Dose-wise, it takes me a lot to get going sometimes. Energy levels reached some stellar heights. I was literally overflowing with it. Easily manageable for me but I've noticed I have more tolerance to 5-Methoxylated tryptamines than most.



I will definitely try this again maybe with more 2C-I but I doubt I would raise the dose of 5MEO-AMT more than 2-5 mg.
