Just recently I aquired for the first time half a gram of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-phenethylamine. I decided to go with a not too high dosage for my first trial, to make sure that I could handle it. Just to make this brief, this was one of the most visually exciting substances that i've ever taken. I took it at night, and the most profound visual effect was of being outside, and it looking like there were shooting stars everywhere! The colors were magnificent, with reds and yellows flowing everywhere. I did not have much *cosmic* insight, but just a wonderful time. It was an amazing experience. I had no body load, and just felt fantastic the whole time. 



It lasted a total of around 10 hours, and I came off of the peak very gradually. No nausea was experienced, but that might have been because I ingested 25mg of Dramamine II right after ingesting the drug. Also, I believe that a great aspect of this substance was the total lack of any negative side effects. All I experienced was pure dream world ecstacy. Music was also amazing, especially trance. All in all, this was a fantastic experience that I definately do intend to repeat, and at a bit higher dosage! Safe and happy voyages to all you psychonauts:)
