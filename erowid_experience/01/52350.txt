First of all I want to add that everyday I take Venlafaxine (150mg), Lithium (1.2g) and Quetiapine (25mg) but I've never experienced any problem in combining my `medical dose' with other drugs, including Alcohol, cannabis, some anticolinergics, sibutramine, etc. Lithiums seems to add resistance to my mind, since I hardly experience hallucinations and delirium with the same dose that my friends had taken (and they become insane).



Well I was at the University very sleepy, I had a test coming so I decided to try bupropion in high concentrations. I took 600mg at once, the effect was useful, I could focus a lot, I felt tired but not sleepy, my mind could think faster, which after the test was useless (really I couldn't stop thinking about EVERYTHING). In my way home I decided to smoke a joint to relax, bupropion makes me feel more nervious.



Less than half the joint and the world started to move, I got in the rear seat of my car and started to experience some hallucinations, like dreaming. It was hard because I got out of the car to piss and the trees were really scary, I had auditive hallucinations too. Normally I never hallucinate with cannabis, no matter how high the dose is.



I `woke up' like 3 hours later, felt a little bit dizzy but perfectly normal, no nausea, not sleepy, not stupid, so I drove home.
