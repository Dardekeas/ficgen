This experience took place a couple years back.  I was using my friends bathroom when i looked in the medicine cabinet and discovered a bottle of Darvocet.  I'de heard of it before, but had never actually taken it.  I decided to pocket 4 medium sized red pills.  



About 2 days later, a few friends and myself decided to have a few beers at my place.  But before drinking, I popped all 4 Darv's (not the brightest idea).  We sat in my basement playing cards and just talking.  The darvocet made me feel intoxicated fairly quick.  After just three beers i was quite buzzed.  



After finishing my 6th bottle, i was quite drunk.  I also had a very warm, numb feeling throughout my body.  A friend suggested we go out to the garage and smoke a couple bowls.  We packed some fairly potent cannabis into my waterpipe.  After just 4 Hits, i felt extremely stoned.  I was forced to sit down and lean against the wall.  My vision became very obscured, all i could see was a really bright light.  This sensation lasted for a couple minutes, and afterwords i still felt very intoxicated.  I managed to drag myself into the house and collapsed onto the couch.  Just laying on my back listening to Led Zeppelin was extremely pleasurable.  



I awoke the next day feeling drained, and my vision was still off a little bit.  But besides that, no real `hangover effects'.  Haven't used Darvocet since that day, but am considering using it again without the alcohol.
