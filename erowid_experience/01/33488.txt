cacao beans are incredible.  a definite food of the gods\ldots 



I first encountered the idea (meme) of chocolate as a ethnobotanical in reading mckenna's Food of the God's\ldots but i still didn't consider it as something worth investigating.  Then there was that movie with jonny depp, and it led to me revising my feelings concerning chocolate\ldots yet, i still was not on the band-wagon\ldots or any wagon for that matter!



and then it happened, in my search for synthetic endo-cannabinoids for sale on the web, specifically, anandamide, i came across several listings stating that the cacao bean contains anadamide\ldots and then, the disappointing news that the body breaks down this blissful molecule very rapidly\ldots and then the good news, not only does cacao contain anandamide, but FAAH inhibitors\ldots slow the break down, increase the bliss\ldots 



so then I ordered some raw cacao beans\ldots and when they arrived, I chewed them\ldots as I sat in my court ordered AA meeting.  and as I chewed them, and sucked on them, I become more alive, much more alive\ldots was it the anadamide, the theobromine, the faah inhibition?  The amalgam had me feeling good, and joyous\ldots  nietzschean joy at that!  oh, the beans are good. 



then I said to myself\ldots well, if you can chew them, and they are that wonderful\ldots what about the smoke?  I bought some nestle's powdered cacao [sic]\ldots packed a corncob pipe full\ldots sparked it up\ldots  and it smokes better than any herbal alternative to marijuana that I have tried\ldots also\ldots the effects are just as strong if not stronger than sinicuichi, dagga, etc\ldots highly recomended.



so that's it\ldots and i plan on doing an extract with everclear and cacao powder, let the alcohol evaporate, and smoke the resin\ldots  it hard work, but if not me, who, who will sacrifice themselves to the science of the dancing monkey?



`and we should count as lost every day on which we did not dance' 

-Nietsche\ldots (a quote I found on a box of chocolate several years back)\ldots
