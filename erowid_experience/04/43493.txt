After reading some of the previous experience reports concerning Voacanga, I was a bit wary to ingest the seeds whole--I can do without the gastrointestinal cramps.  Oh, a bit of info about me: 21 yr. old male, 150 lbs, extensive experimentation with San Pedro, morning glories, marijuana, mushrooms, and salvia divinorum.  



I first attempted to do an alkaloid extraction of 75 seeds using vinegar and ammonia (see `Extraction studies of Tabernanthe iboga and Voacanga africana').  However, I was unsuccessful in coaxing the dissolved alkaloids out of solution.  75 seeds down the drain\ldots 



Ok, so I figured that if the extraction wouldn't work, I would just grind up the seeds and make them into a tea.  For those who are not aware, this is the preferred method of ingesting morning glory seeds among the native american tribes of mexico and central america.  So on a whim, I grinded 75 more seeds, popped them into an automatic drip coffee maker, added about 1 1/2 cups of water with a splash of lemon juice (to raise the acidity), and let it brew.  I drank the not-so-foul tasting liquid around 2:45 p.m., but I wasn't expecting too much.  From this point onward, I smoked cannabis on and off for the remainder of the experience--at the rate of about a bowl an hour.  



Within about an hour and a half, I began to feel the effects of the Voacanga.  First, it was a light stimulation, similar to caffeine.  It was actually a very pleasant stimulation--not a racy, paranoid state which I've sometimes experienced after ingesting amphetamines.  It was more of a centered alertness.  Then the visuals began to kick in.  They were really amazing--I wasn't expecting so much out of a haphazard coffee maker extraction.  They were somewhat of a cross between San Pedro/morning glory visuals--very colorful, twisting undulating shapes.  I remember seeing various snakes, animals, human faces, and even a dark-skinned figure seated in the lotus position.  The body high at this point was incredible--I almost felt like I was floating out of my seat.  The stimulation provided by the voacangine worked very synergistically within the context of the experience--it was the most lucid, clear-headed trip I've experienced.  The visuals were about as strong as some mescaline trips I've experienced, but without the usual drowsy torpor which tends to accompany the peak of the experience.



The trip peaked within about four hours after ingestion, and I continued to experience a warm psychedelic after-glow for four or five hours thereafter.  Definitely one of the longest-acting entheogens I've tried; these seeds would be great for day-trips since they have a stimulating rather than sedating quality.  Also, the after-glow was very similar to that of mescaline in that I felt extremely refreshed and centered--not tired at all.  



I will definitely be trying these seeds again. In my experience, cannabis has been the integral catalyst which sends me reeling into psychedelic wonderland.  It tends to diminish any negative somatic effects brought about by the entheogen as well as GREATLY increasing visuals.  I, myself, have never used an entheogen without the aid of cannabis, and I believe that many enthenogenic experiments would be greatly enhanced by it's effects.
