After my earlier negative experiences with some other research chemicals,

2C-C and 5-MeO-DiPT (Foxy Methoxy), whose heavy body load and insufficient

psychedelic yield got me disappointed, I have approached this chemical

with a degree of apprehension and skepticism. I needn't have to worry;

this is a very gentle drug of rare beauty.



Xavier (my partner) and I decided to tag on an experiment with this

drug to the end of our MDMA-enhanced love-making session, having just

celebrated our anniversary. We were both already quite tired, but still

felt we'd like to extend this wonderful night for a bit longer.



I decided to apply this drug by IM injection, in order to bypass the

deleterious effects of the digestive tract, and to speed up the action.

The drug acted quite fast, perhaps within 10 minutes, and my threshold

dose was about 5mg. I was then comfortable enough to gradually increase

our dose to a total of 40mg, for each of us. The dose-to-response curve

was remarkably linear, gently tapering off. There was very little body

load. The effects started to subside in approx one or two hours, and I

have extended the duration of the trip by topping up.



The first thing I noticed were gentle rushes in my face, followed by

altered perception of colours. It's a bit like if I turned my

internal `colour contrast' adjustment control to the max, and then some.

Colours become incredibly deep and vibrant. Xavier (my partner) and I

were watching a porn movie; this was turned into a piece of art, a

feast to our eyes.



Watching Xavier's face, I saw it transformed before my eyes. He has a

handsome face, with some strong features, and I saw him transformed

into a Star Trek alien, then yet another type of alien, and then some

strange animals, one after the other. He looked a bit scary, but I

realized that I would still love him even if he remained like that.



Closing my eyes produced a never-ending tapestry of intricate artistic

imagery which, if one was able to remember it all, would keep alive a

generation of fantastic artists.



Interestingly though, this drug was not at all trippy in the Ketamine

sense. It did not affect my mind; there were no `conversations with

gods', no funny mental loops, no time dilation. It never got scary. I didn't 

actually get deeply involved in the `action'. Rather, I was in a

position of an amused, almost detached, observer. That was quite enough

for me, but Xavier was somewhat disappointed, being used to a deeper

involvement on Ketamine and complaining that the visuals were too

weak even while he was at the peak of his experience.



Having said that, I did in fact notice some subtle mental cues of deeper

psychedelic deja-vu of my earlier Ketamine sessions. The drug does seem

able to get me close to some of the doors of higher perception, but leaves

them safely shut.



In terms of the stimulant/depressant scale, this drug was mildly

stimulant, in a peaceful, gentle way. I would imagine (as I heard) that

it would make a great combo with MDMA (in our case the MDMA effect was

already over). But it was not a rave club drug; I wouldn't be able to dance on it.

In fact I tended to develop a slight nausea just by going to the

bathroom and back, which however, quickly subsided when I got back in

bed again. It was not a sensual drug; I probably couldn't have sex on it,

it does not seem to enhance any erotic feelings. But if I wanted to just

lie down and relax, and perhaps watch some movie, I could be sure it

will become a work of art, a colourful, yet not kitchy, eye candy, while

still leaving my mind intact enough to be able to follow the plot.



This is a successful research chemical which could in fact make it to

the mainstream. It should have a street name; I'd simply call it `Colour'.
