Just wanted to share an interesting tidbit about the drug Seroquel that has baffled two different doctors. I've been lazily prescribed Seroquel after an even lazier diagnosis of BiPolar Type I Disorder.  I've never agreed with either this diagnosis or the treatment plan.  Because of my disagreement with said treatment plan, in 2005 I decided to stop taking all three of my psychoactive drugs (I was also on Trileptal and Zoloft), all one at a time.  



I started with Zoloft and left it at that for awhile.  Cold turkey, no problem.  I figured any negative side effects were being displaced by the other two.  Then I stopped the Trileptal.  Again, no change.  I was beginning to believe that my theory that doctors prescribe placebo type medications in abundance to normally healthy people was ringing true.  Finally, the Seroquel.  I normally take 100mg of this bastard once a day, always at night since it knocks me out.



The first night without taking it I lie in bed sweating - tossing and turning all night.  My body was screaming for the drug.  The next day was fine.  I had a lot more energy than was typical and I was less irratible.  The future looked bright, indeed.  That night, when falling to sleep, my hands and fingers started itching.  I looked and there was no rash, just persistent itching.  I thought it odd.  The next day, my hands started itching but now so did my head, and my perineum of all places.  I was in full on junkie scratch mode.  Plus, that nervous energy experienced the first night trying to sleep had returned en force. 



By day four I thought I was going to be fired from my job for really scratching and twitching all day long, it was bad.  So, that night, I took another 100mg Seroquel and laid down and slept the best night of sleep I had had all week long.  And, the next day, no more itching either.
