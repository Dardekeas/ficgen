My experience with psychedelic compunds has been so far very careful and controlled\ldots I went into my experiments with an open mind and a purpose. I have tested several combinations and varying doses of several `legal' substances and some substances I have either cultivated myself or synthesised with friends.



No experience short of my first low dose DMT trip could prepare me for my experience with this high a dose of 5-meo-dmt.



My first thoughts on this drug were that it would be similar to DMT because of the similar chemical makeups\ldots I did not take into account the differing doses and took what could be compared to `way too much'. At 17 mg's I thought I would get a common dose, much to my surprise the normal dose for smoking is about 5 mg's. Big mistake.



I loaded up a contraption I devised using tin foil as a melting surface and a funnel for smoke delivery. I covered the bottom of this funnel with the foil and heated the chemical with a lighter underneath. I slowly inhaled the smoke, it could be described as slightly chemical with the odor of synthetic grapes. I took two large lungfuls and held the second for about 10 seconds.



2 seconds after exhaling I began to feel an intense rush\ldots as if my brain had just boarded a rocket, but had left my body behind. My entire body went numb and my mouth felt as if were on fire.



Another 2 seconds\ldots oh my god\ldots I feel as if the entire world is gone\ldots I'm cold\ldots it feels like a brain freeze such as when you drink a slushey to fast, except without the pain.



I lost total track of time, seconds seemed to go as slow as minutes\ldots no real hallucinations except for an altered sense of depth\ldots I can't control my body\ldots it's as if I want to move slowly but when I move my hand it shoots up into the air wildly. Everything is strange and alien to me\ldots I can't seem to understand why I have a mouth\ldots or a tounge\ldots my cat appears to be the wisest entity I have ever known. 



About 5-10 minutes in\ldots .jesus I think I've driven myself over the edge\ldots god is gone\ldots people are only in my head. I do not exist in this world\ldots I am dynamic\ldots we live in millions of dimensions at once\ldots countless ways of existing. Other beings are here\ldots they are taking me somewhere\ldots I feel as if they know what to do.



The creatures are grey and cold looking\ldots if I open my eyes they disappear and I am in my room on the floor\ldots I close my eyes\ldots I need their help\ldots I need them to help me get back.



20 minutes or so\ldots I just left the aliens\ldots they pushed me back into the coldness\ldots I am alone again but I can feel my hands again\ldots I can feel my heart and my breathing again..I think I'll be ok.



30 minutes\ldots I found my way back\ldots I am almost totally back and feeling more like I have smoked a mild dose of grass.



1 hour+\ldots I am totally baseline again. This was `way too much' for anyone. I felt almost a strange comfort in the void of coldness\ldots sort of like being in a womb but without the feeling of connection\ldots infact more like total disconnection from the world. I can see how this drug could be used to treat true psychotics to help them `find the way home'. The dosage of this drug should be more around 10 mg's for a very strong dose\ldots but no more than that. I found the experience to be less insightful than I had planned infact it felt a little more theraputic in a sense. If low doses of this drug were used ofver an extended period of time it could help more dissasosiative people find a connection to the world.
