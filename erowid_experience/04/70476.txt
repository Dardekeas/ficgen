Let me preface everything by saying I'm not a prolific smoker of anything---I've never once smoked tobacco (hate the smell), so take my experiences with a grain of salt.  I'm lucking if I can hold it in for 15 secs.



Weekends are the one chance I have to relax after working news the whole week.   I became interested in Calea b/c I heard it would help induce dreams.  Although, honestly, I've never had that experience with it.  

     	

Without getting overly technical about measurements, I basically just dumped all three into the bowl of my Hookah and chased it with some red wine since I have sinus problems and ANY smoke tends to set my sinuses (internal) on fire. I also put on some mellow new age music and found myself very relaxed after about 5 mins.  Occasionally, dizzy even (in a good way).  I'm can't vouch for the psychedelic effect others have had, but I did feel a nice, pleasing mellow buzz.  For all I know that could have been the deprivation of oxygen, but if it is, don't tell me.  I kinda like the mellow feeling---puts a smile on my face.  But no sleepiness.



Now, I'd been drinking the wine for about 30 mins. before and had my usual wine buzz.  But this definitely enhanced the feeling.  I could feel a slight motor effect, so fortunately I had no plans to travel.



All in all it was a pleasant mild high, with no lapse in mental clarity.  I think my typing may have even improved (badly needed).  Not to mention the smoke helped me hock up a bunch of nastiness collecting in my lungs all week. So I'd give this occasional herbal experience a mild thumbs up.  Good for relaxing.
