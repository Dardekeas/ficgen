Earlier this year, I had the most weirdest, oddest, and the most profound experience, I have only tried Acid about 7 times, only taken shrooms once, smoked/eat pot about 3 times a month last 5 or so years. I have never tried other sorts of drugs, I'm not really a `drug user', I'm more of wine/beer drinker. But I'm a cactus grower, been growing cactus as hobby.



I fasted for 18 hours, didn't eat anything, just plenty of water and apple juice.



I had some peyotes, San Pedro, and Peruvians cactus, I used 6x 2.5cm wide peyote buttons, about a foot of San Pedro and half a foot of Peruvian, I peeled, took the core out, boiled with water for approx 4 hours, then blended,drained thru fine cloth, etc the lot, and I added some Apple juice and heaps of Lime juice.



I managed to drink 4 cups of the most awful crap that I have ever tasted, it was the hardest thing I have ever done, about hour later I felt really really sick, I thought I was actually being poisoned and was dying, I was in mild panic state, but my girlfriend calmed me down, repeatly telling me thats its all OK, etc\ldots and I threw up very voliently, and after approx 15 mins of throwing up, I felt way better, and the visual effect suddenly came up into my visions slowly getting stronger and stronger, it was unexplainable, it was very odd, had a lot of `mental chat' with some sort of god, and that `spirit' I was talking to was `guiding' giving me insights into my life, and I was sort of in dream state, but with my eyes open\ldots very strange but interesting experience.



It was kind of personal, the `trip' gave me a different outlook towards the everchanging world\ldots I really can't explain in words, it was very profound and very highly personal. I would recommended anyone to try this, as long they respect these visionary cactus, I'm starting to understand why it's very important to the American Indian's culture.



The strong visuals last about nearly 8 or 9 hours, it was very powerful, very realistic, it was visuals from the spirits, somewhat emotional. I think this cactus isn't suitable for anyone who has a lot of mental or emotional problems, you have to be strong minded to consume this special cactus. This is not a PARTY drug, it's a personal drug you take in quiet and comfortable surroundings.
