After months of using hydrocodone for knee pain I was interested in Oxycontin, for a few reasons. Obviously it could relieve the pain but I was sure that it would take me into that sought after euphoria I always imagined. Something above vicodin, something powerful and pure. The Oxycodone I could aquire was priced at \$20 for 80mg. I wasn't exactly sure what kind of a deal I was getting but I was too curious to pass up the power opiate.



I was told that snorting the all mighty oxy was the way too go. So I chopped up about 20mg and snorted it. Taking about 8 mins to do it all, making sure after each line I wasn't feeling `too' high. 20 mins goes by and there is something. But nothing I imagined. It wasn't that powerfully loving high I was informed of. It wasn't even that stomach fuzziness I get from the hydro. Nothing like the loving chatting like a damn school girl buzz I get from 40mg vicodin. So I took the other 20 mg orally and waited about an hour. 



Don't get me wrong, it took the pain away but no way compared to the joy I receive from getting doped up from vicodin. This wonder opiate isn't what is all cracked up to be for the price.
