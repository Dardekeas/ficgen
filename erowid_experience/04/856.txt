My friend (who tried it for the first time a few days earlier) prepared the bowl by filling it with cigarette ashes on a screen with the substance on top.  I had done yoga earlier and was sitting on the bed with this friend and another who was interested in it. Both of them were sober. I inhaled the nasty plastic tasting stuff and passed the bowl to one of them. In about 10 seconds I began to feel like my body was disintegrating along with my perception of reality. I knew I needed to lay down as I was losing touch with my body very quickly. When I laid down I focused on a `point' in front of me. All around it were geometric abstract shapes forming and shifting around. Even my body was somehow registering these shapes. As I practiced relaxing I was made hyper aware of my body. My body felt like it was merging into a line through the center of my being. I had a few places where I was aware of `body armor', places where your body holds on to issues from life experiences and was able to really see and let go. the more I let go the more my body merged into this line. 



After a few moments I became the `line' totally and completely. I could `see' a void space that was infinitly filled with other lines forming complex geometric shapes. I could still think as myself and never felt that `I' was lost, even though I was now perceiving myself as only consciousness within this `line'. I felt totally at peace and warm. The hum seemed to make sense as the universal Aum mantra. I understood this place as a place where any infinite levels of possibility could exist at once. the Alpha and the Omega. 



Eventually I heard someone in the room let out a deep breath and thats when I remembered there was another world, the one where my physical body was laying on a bed. I could sense the shell of my physical being return ( I could sense where my body existed vs. the universe), then I could sense the different layers of my persona returning\ldots that was most interesting! I began to move my fingers and toes to feel my boundaries and all was intact. Voices in the hall sounded hollow and full of reverb. I opened my eyes to see my 2 smiling friends\ldots except all I could focus on were thier eyes, everything else was a wet drippy mess of colors and shapes. I felt completely centered and I closed my eyes again to ride the experience out for as long as I could. My body felt like I had released everything I had been holding on to, like I had a great massage. Then I opened my eyes again. I wanted to say everything but my motor control was kind of weak still. 



My friend said `you did good!' and they told me about what they saw coming from me. They said they could see my body going through the reactions of dealing with the `issues' and could tell when I got through them into the void space. Then I looked asleep with a shit eating grin! (which I dont remeber having) It took about 15 minutes for the tripping to finish. Its strange to go from tripping sac to normal in 15 minutes!



I am very glad I got to experience this and would like to do it again. I was able to feel a total connection with all of creation as well as my most inner sense of being. I understand that DMT is present in the Human pituitary gland and there is talk that this is released when you die. I am not sure of this, but was glad to get to see what I am holding onto before its final, and thus work on those things. I saw it as nothing but a positive experience.



However in light of all this, it is nevertheless an extremely powerful experience. I was actually feeling emotional reaction and at some points painful reactions (though fleeting) with the experience of going `up'. I suggest that only people with a good solid understanding of themselves and an ability to find thier `center' take this venture. I am not saying you need to be a yoga master or somebody special, just someone who is somewhat secure in their position in the universe.
