Narr, I've been semi-frustrated by my crude extracts of the lactuca (we have various stages of apparent scariola-virosa hybridization rampant, locally, so scads of pounds is not an issue)\ldots  an effective inebriant at 5-10\% (estimated) potency `black crud,' but for the sake of whatever gods have a fondness in their heart for mad alchemists, I simply *must* do better - not only is professional pride involved, but I've a friend with a signifigantly broken ribcage\ldots  s/he deserves the right to laugh unfettered\ldots 



Thus it was that I ended up with several grams lactucin freebase, and more on the way\ldots  (for those of you desperate to know the details, I believe there's a fair bit of detail on acid-base extractions out\ldots  look around.  I use baking soda, USP - the plant already took care of the acid phase - and replace the ether layer with filtration, `cause I'm a poor alchemist\ldots  thanks be to our tweak(TMX)-addicted culture that coffee filters are a half-cent a piece!)



Spooning forth a little bit of the fine-grained mud (whitish crystals + brownish organic tea = beige mud) into a small ice-cream sample spoon reserved for alchemical purpouses, I kick the rest back into the wash (h2o)\ldots  an alchemist must have *some* pride.  (the damn things came out looking the same\ldots  grr\ldots )\ldots  run over to my friends house, and came back disappointed\ldots  ::sigh::  s/he can live with their pain; me, I use the crude (sap) to re-set broken and dislocated joints\ldots 



So I load up the pipe with my small chunk `o crystals (they dried to 'crack rock' consistency), `cause I'm thinking `hey, just how *do* I know I've got the right part?  This *could* just be undissolved baking soda and a few vitamins and amino acids, eh?'



Curiosity is often a fatally overpowering force, for alchemists. ;)



\ldots  and so I take the hit.  It's small - this *is,* after all, the amount that will sit comfortably on the very edge of an ice-cream sample spoon - and vaporizes near-instantly.



Pheow!



By the time I breathe out, I'm damn near under; grab the knife, bubba, I won't notice.  It has a similarity to the `I am in a completely different world than the world I'm in' feeling of carbogen (which I've never had *with* the oxygen - empty 2ltr), but is, naturally, it's own thing\ldots 



\ldots  and as the peak subsides, I discover that a few milligrams concentratedly rushing to the brain is signifigantly different than a few milligrams diluted through 160 lbs\ldots  it's still the same set-back, watching the world sensation, but there's a *lot* less of it.  `course, it sticks around longer than the inhalation peak does, up to about 6 hours in my sum-total experience\ldots  narcosis (or was it narcolepsy) sets in after the first 20-40 minutes\ldots   



Speaking of sum-total experience, based on such and 'Legal Highs by Adam Gottlieb' (how poetic, a treatise on the power ordained unto various plants by a person whose name translates `the love of God.'), findable here, I surmise that it is lactosol and/or lactucic acid which is the euphoriant (that's *high-dose* euphoriant) in this plant.  Lactucin is, apparently, just a narcotic analgesic whippet.  ;)



So, to all `yall who say that 'opium lettuce is near-bunk/bunk,' I'm just going to have to laugh at you\ldots  yeah, uncultivated ditchweed is pretty `mild,' `till you isomerize the oil - or spend 30 years on a breeding project\ldots  cut it to crystal, dawg, and try to use for bonafide medical purpouses only\ldots  it won't take a full bowl for do-it-yourself-home-surgery (note : I neither recommend nor am I responsible for lettuce-whacked individuals carving themselves or others to bits.  In fact, I'm responsible for nothing.)
