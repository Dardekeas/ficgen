Hello, this is just a quick account of my first experience with 5-HTP. I should probably give some quick background on my drug history. 



I have smoked bud (and the occasional hash) for several years, though I'm cutting down at the moment. I did cocaine for a couple of months but I kicked it before it became a habit. I've tried Salvia (didn't like it at all) and poppers (which really aren't worth it). I have recently not enjoyed bud as much as normally which is one of the reasons for cutting down. I have had two bad panic attacks while stoned in the last month in which I've become particularly overwhelmed by the presence of people and my thoughts were wracked with fear of going into a salvia-like trip. 



I have already come to terms with these bad experiences and have even finally been able to understand my terrifying salvia trip. I think this has coincided with me becoming more spiritual and religious.



Anyway, today I went out of school with some mates for a cigarette at lunch where one friend (P) took her daily dose of 5-HTP. I asked her what they were and she explained that they were anti-anxiety pills. When she said that she had six with her, I asked if I could try one. Well, as you've probably guessed, she said yes.



On the way back into school, I asked P what the pills actually did. `Oh, they increase the levels of serotonin in your brain' she said, and I said `Oh, like ecstasy.' I've been wanting to try MDMA recently and I thought it was good that I could get a mild impression of what it would be like.



I was feeling more calm and happy pretty soon though I wrote this off as either placebo or simply the effects of a friendly atmosphere. However, I was beginning to feel a lot more extroverted, playful and conversational. I got into and odd conversation with P about it being good that I was feeling how she usually felt. Impulsively, I leaned towards her so I could look at her through her glasses so I could `see you how you see the world'. Sounds retarded I know, but she laughed and I was happy.



I went on through the day in a very happy mood of general well-being, a bit like the happiness you get when drunk. I was laughing a lot at trivial things, goofing around a lot and making jokes. It was, in fact, a lot like being drunk without being inebriated.



I lazed through the day in the content aura of the happy pills. Coincidentally, straight after school I was auditioning for a place in an upcoming gig with my band. I had very minimal nerves which is unusual for me. I usually get particularly nervous up until adrenaline kicks in and I can just go with it. I was very much in touch and I knew precisely what I was doing, I could just get on with it without worrying and that was great.



Well, I'm back home now and writing this report. I can tell you I really enjoyed this mild and pleasant drug and will certainly ask P for another some time soon.



My band got in, by the way.



Peace, love, safe.
