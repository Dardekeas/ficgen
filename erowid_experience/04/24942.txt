Being an insomniac, I took up the chance to experiment with tranquilizers when my dealer gave me the remnants of a bottle of xylazine he had procured on a previous pharm run from Mexico.  On the day of the experiment I had smoked some cannabis hours earlier but no real effects remained with me.  A big part of this experience for me was the use of a needle.  This is the first time I was able to be sure that I was getting a sterile product; I didn't really care about the xylazine as much as indulging my fascination with needles.  I had never injected anything because I had never really had anything benign enough for me to feel safe injecting.  I injected, using sterile procedure, about half a cc of the solution (20mg per cc), what I perceived as a small amount.  About five to ten minutes after injection I felt very tired, as if I had been using a lot of vicodin but without the euphoria.  I could have fought the tiredness but I felt that my body was telling me something and I fell fast asleep for about two hours.  When I woke up, I still felt very tired and had very bloodshot eyes and was up only long enough to go to the bathroom and sleep from around 9 pm to 9 am.  I had a slight headache the next day that was alleviated (but not eliminated) by taking some aspirin.  All in all, I would not really recommend the drug.  There are much more controllable and useful sleeping drugs and there were no `fun' effects to the drug at all, giving it zero recreational value unless sleeping for 12+ hours.
