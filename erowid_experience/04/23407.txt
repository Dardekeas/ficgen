Well one of my buddies got a call to go hook up some dude with a bag of herb, so we all piled in the car and headed into town.  We met the dude at a gas station and he invited us back to his home to smoke, so of coarse we went.



We went inside and met his friends, there was him and about six of his buddies.  They had all moved to the USA from Iraq some time ago .  We smoked a bowl of the herb and then they asked if we wanted to smoke the hooka.  Ah the hooka\ldots   They had this cool blue and gold glass hooka with eastern designs on it, it had a huge bowl on top and they loaded it with something I had never seen before.



They passed around this little tub of heavenly smelling peach tobacco so everyone could get a look.  I guess it was tobacco cured with peaches somehow, It is still very moist and gooey and gives of a most pleasant smell.  So they load the bowl and mix in just a little herb, then the bowl is covered with aluminum foil that has had many holes poked in it with a pencil tip.  Then they put some burning coals on top of the foil.  I guess they were special smoking coals, I dont know where to get them.



Then the first guy takes this monster rip, I mean monster, and blows it out his nose.  Me and my buddy both gave each other the holly shit we're screwed, these guys are profesionals look.  Then the dude does tis about five more times in a row, and I was amazed, never before had I seen such mad smoking!  It was insane!  Its a one man hooka so everyone takes a turn.  Then its my buddys turn and he takes this huge rip.  When I say huge I mean HUGE,  Its kind of like right at the end of a good herb hit when I get that really thick smoke, But its an entire lung full start to finish of the thickest smoke I've ever seen!  Then he blows it out his nose too!  I was shocked!  Then he did it like five more times!  So its my turn, I empty my lungs completely, put in the mouth peice and start rippin,  my lungs are about half full and I can't feel ant pain or burning or anything, I begin to wonder if I'm doing it right, Lungs full, exhale, And this HUGE hit comes flowing out!



It tasted so good, so smooth, a good comparison between the peach hooka tobacco and a cigarette would be like drinking ice cold mountain spring water compared to drinking gasoline that some one had puked rotten milk into.  No kidding.This was the greatest smoke I'd ever had, herb, opium, hashish, cigaretts, cloves, cigars, you name it.  Not the best buzz mind you it was an intense tobacco buzz, I started sweating balls and got a little of the spins, but it was the sweetest, tastiest, smoothest, funest thing I've ever smoked.  The only thing I can imagine that would be better is mabey a hooka full of peach tobacco, herb, opium, and hashish combined, that would be sweeeeeet.



P.S. It was verry cool to sit around in a big circle with three middle class american kids and about six Iraqi imigrants, we talked a little about politics and the war that looked eminant,(this was about eight months befor the war).  We asked them what the thought about Sadam and politics and one of them said something that stuck with me.  He said, `It's just the polititions, Its just politics, the politisions they do not know life, this (as he gestured around the circle) is life.'  A couple of dudes from very diferent places and backgrounds, siting down peacefully, sharing some good herb, some good smoke, and good conversation.
