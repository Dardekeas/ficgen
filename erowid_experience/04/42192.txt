San Pedro. Unique from mushrooms, LSD, PCP, or Jimson weed. It is a gentle brush with mescaline, my all time favorite psycadelic. Mushrooms, in my oppinion, are to much of a tease, a pleasant, very enjoyable buzz. LSD is very good, a controlled, chemical trip, but it to often occurs that acid leads to the fear and the ominous vibes that lead a tripping mind into a paraniod funk. PCP is not really for me. And Jimson Weed was just plain madness, a 16 hour vacation from sanity. But mescaline, mescaline is the laid back, but at the same time, extremely psycadelic drug to which I give the award. Mescaline in its purest form is, of course, far better than the San Pedro or Peyote. However, at least for me, pure mescaline has become frustratingly hard to find these days, only surfacing in a several week period every 5 to 6 months. So last week I settled for the disgusting cactus slime.



Yes, I brought a San Pedro cactus from a little shop on the edge on Austin. It was about 2 feet, a little s.o.b., but it was gonna half to do. So first I skinned it-I have done this plenty times before and find that freezing the cactus in little sugar covered chunks is the best way to get her done. Then I chopped it up, rolled it in sugar, and put it in the freezer. My parents are very cool, so I don't gotta worry about them gettin in my business. If I don't steal my Mom's beer or my Dad's weed, then my stuff is safe and sound. So, I went to my senior prom, forgot about the cactus for a few days, then on Tuesday I decided, what the hell, I'll go out into the woods and trip after school today.



When school let out, I hopped into my truck and drove all the way across the street to my house, grabbed the cactus out of the freezer, and set out for an adventure. I dont normally trip during daylight hours, but hey, I didn't care in the slightest. I drove to a nature preserve of about 200 acres, parked my truck and set off. I was equiped with; 2 feet of san pedro, a water bottle of orange juice, and one of water, goggles, swim trunks, a beach towell, a pair of garden gloves, 6 bananas and a kiwi, and my pipe and 2 grams of blueberry bud.



I walked a forest path to a nice little swimming hole under a small waterfall. A beautiful spot surrounded by trees and moss covered rocks. A wonderful place to enjoy nature in all her wonder as I began to trip. One of mescaline's most mystical charms is its ability to place you at one with your surroundings, or more acurately, at one with the earth. I laid out the towell in a nice shady patch of grass next to the water and sat down.



Upon opening my backpack I first took out the cactus, then the orange juice and the kiwi. Sitting crosslegged on the towell I began to swallow down large hunks of the bitter-sweet cactus-sugar,and wash them down with gulps from the juice. After about 5 minutes, I had cleaned up on that Cactus. It was in my belly, and I felt like gagging. But the juice and the kiwi helped that, and after I got over it I took out my pipe and a nice little nug to fill it with. I smoked for awhile and got to feeling pretty high. Then I set off on a scenic walk to some cliffs above the swimming hole, and looked out over the wood land. It wasn't until about 45 minutes later that the mescaline began to sneak itself into my consciousness.



I was sitting back on the towel in a state of stoned meditation, a peaceful way of preparing for this sort of earthy trip, when I was brought back to reality by the first gentle touches of the drug. Tiny tingles of electricity running through my veins, and a light feeling in my head. At this point, I took off my shoes and shocks and waded out into the ankle deep shallows and wondered at the sensation of the cool water and rough sand between my toes, I knew these things were becoming enhanced by the mescaline inside me.



About 30 minutes later the forest stood quiet with unknown anticipation. Then, I slight rustle stopped a bird in its track, movement behind the bushes, ever so small, caused a squirrel to run for the trees. And suddenly I burst from the bushes with a freshly carved spear (stick with a pointed end) held high in my hands. My primal instincts has taken over and I decided to just let it flow. It was not insanity, but rather calculated madness that had possessed me to do this.



A rush of energy that could only be satisfied in the hunt. I ran around in the woods, seeing bizzarre but natural flickerings in the shadows. Hunting an imaginary, but all to real prey. After awhile-at this point I was at full body trip but had not experienced more than a hint of visuals-I went back to my little spot and lit it up again.



There we go, I was trippin now. The rays of late afternoon light glistened and seemed to weave translucent paterns in the air. A blue, tranparent film of reflection hovered a foot above the waters surface, and all things around me swayed to an unknown, but all to familiar tune of perfect harmony. I saw things all around me in magnified radiance and altered coloration, and I knew that God was here, and this force of energy inside me and all things that moved around me in their instinctual routines was His ultimate masterpiece.



Now, I'm not a very religious person at all, I believe all the separate sects of religion are just another means by which we can differienciate ourselves from one another. Just another means of division and hostility. But I do believe, when I look at the wonders around me, that there is a God.  And when I sat tripping and pondering the contours of this beauty, I gained some instinctual knowledge that the creator of all this innocent acceptance and harmony did not wish for us to do anything but to gaze in wonder at what we have been given, and to be at one with it.



The sun was burning down on me as the trip intensified. It was getting quite hot and I decided to take a swim. I stripped off my shorts and boxers and stood up straight, enjoying the warmth and the soft breeze blowing across my naked body. It was soothing, and as I slipped into my swim shorts I saw lines of interweaving colors swirling around me and patterns of sunlight made parts of the ground light up with fire-like intensity.



I got into the water and instantly became one with it. My body became a flowing river as I danced as one with the water's fluid current. I got my goggles on and examined with fascinated curiousity the underwater landscape of colorful harmony. Sometimes I would almost forget to come up and breath. After awhile I felt it necessary that I be nude, so I slid off my shorts and began to propel myself speedily around in the cool water, marveling at the strange sensations as the pull of the water carressed by body and I began to dance underwater in slow motion.



Later I sat up on a rock at the top of a nearby hill and felt an overwhelming sense of tranquility. I relieved myself of the edge of the cliff and watched the sky being painted many different vibrant colors by as invisible hand. The trip was subsiding but the coloration of the sunset before me was still very enhanced and I still felt the vibrations of nature. I was at one with the world, just where I needed to be. It was a great experience, and I wish the same to all who strive to explore its mysteries.
