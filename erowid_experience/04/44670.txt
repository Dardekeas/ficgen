John (names changed in the interest of privacy) is a friend of mine, who has a rather serious case of Disassociative Identity Disorder (DID - commonly referred to as Multiple Personality Disorder). Note that John is the `host', so to speak, and shares his body with several other persons. John and the others take turns controlling the body, and each has his (or her) own personality, disposition, even pattern of speech. I was talking sort of offhand about 2C-I and the personality who was out at the moment said she liked the idea, so I pursued it. They came to a group decision in favor of taking it.



John was given a 12 mg dose of 2C-I and instructed to write a trip report. Due to the nature of 2C-I and John's condition, it is very hard for them to write up a trip report. They tried:



TRIP REPORT. \#=indecipherable

0210: took it

0240: severe headache

0250: \#\#\#\#\# cognitive effects?

0300: balance is screwed

0303: claustrophobia and swaying

0304: color spots : red

0317: tired, wondering where is my euporia?

0320: wave of euphoria, extreme cognitive effects

0322: OMFG this is so cool\ldots .

03-25 yes, definitely high. different to \#\# expected. Sadly must sleep.

03-27 wtf? only 77 mins in\ldots .

03-30 uh oh, nausea

3-32 this rocks, if i can just sleep and get up and\ldots 

33 omg 93 mins..does it get better? am i high or just very tired?

The words GENERAL CONSENSUS seem to work.

4-31 until

4-38 \ldots extreme time looping

4-53 teamwork is great. Euphoria?

\#\#\#\# Shelley was here

\#\#\#\# while my hand contr\#\#ol is ok. . . Shell\#\#ei\#lo\#es Carlostan\ldots 

Close one eye= GOOD, close both eyes = BAD

6-08 Shelley says i love you\ldots and where did the freaking p\#\#enci\#l appe\#r

from?\#

\#\#\#\# I think Shelley majorly tripped\ldots .

6-43 Dont call each other idiots on the 2ci\ldots or the ***IDIOTS*** who are

***NOT*** on the 2ci might hear you, Shelley\ldots 

7-40 Amanda sez Where are my glasses

7-41 Amanda sez, Will they actually help?

8-23 Amanda- WTF? NOT HIGH

8-40 still not high. I'm out

9-30 Iniko says wow, cool ^-^

10-30 Grace sez kewl

11-00 Food is great



-----



The following is an except from a conversation between me and Iniko, a 16-year-old female, one of the several personalities.



Me: I never did get a good trip report off you, you know.



Iniko: What do you need to know?



Me: What time you took it, what you took it with, where you went, what you did, how it felt physically and mentally?



Iniko: I took it with [a soft drink] at about two in the morning. We stayed locked in our room, except a short trip to college. Physically, just really messed up, like there was a ten-second delay between touching something and feeling it\ldots  A lot of it is really hard to describe. It taught us a lot about each other, though - like how our minds work and stuff.



Me: Can you supply details?



Iniko: Grace- It's hard for her to keep balanced. I'm stable. Amanda is\ldots  just extremely tired, it would take months of rest for her to feel good again. Shelley is also unstable- she has her sexual side and her innocent side, and struggles for balance.



Me: That sounds complicated. All in all, would you say it was a good thing?



Iniko: (laughs) Hell yeah!



Me: You say it will take months of rest for Amanda? Why's that?



Iniko: She has- let's call it Soul Weariness or Soul Exhaustion.



Me: Caused by 2C-I?



Iniko: No- She's given so much to nurturing all of us, and she's taken so much CRAP from the outside world.



Me: I see.



Iniko: The 2C-I barely seemed to affect her. She kept saying it did nothing, so we just switched.



Me: But to some others, there were definite effects?



Iniko: Oh yeah. Shelley went sky high! (laughs)



Me: Was there a sense of confusion, with everyone trying to get a word in edgewise?



Iniko: Not really.



Me: Can you offer anything as to how it was mentally?



Iniko: It- (pause) made it very easy to imagine things. Like the amount of energy needed was far less than normal. It was confusing as far as - well, it was our first trip, and we didn't understand for the first few minutes - it seemed like time, real time, went really slowly, allowing us to do anything and still have time. Seems the younger, the smaller ones had the most fun-figures, I guess.



Me: You say imagining things - you mean OEV or CEV?



Iniko: OEV or CEV?



Me: Open-eye and closed-eye visuals, respectively. Like, did you see things that weren't there? Or did you just lean back and imagine things?



Iniko: Mostly just the second one.



Me: Did you see patterns and things?



Iniko: Grace saw a Roman-style garden at one point. Certainly with eyes open everything warped at the edges - oh, and our concentration span was really short. We have a sort of trippy forest poster, that [I found] was fun to look at, it kind of became 3-D.



Me: Was everyone experiencing it at once, or did you take turns?



Iniko: Turns.



Me: About how long did you go between switching? And how long did it last, overall?



Iniko: Er, couple of hours, I think, there were a couple of naps too. And, uh, it lasted almost sixteen hours.



Me: Was there a definite peak?



Iniko: About six hours in - Shelley got smashed. (laughs)



Me: Did you take it with anything? On an empty stomach?



Iniko: Totally empty stomach the whole time - silly mistake, and we suffered for it too.



Me: I warned you about that.



Iniko: I know.



Me: Anything in particular you want to add about it?



Iniko: I want a higher dose next time. (laughs)



Me: (laughs) I told you that too, didn't I. When you're coming off, you always wish you had had just a little bit more [to start]. Anything about\ldots  how it relates to DID?



Iniko: Hmm. Well, it just made us more aware of how Everything is fragmentary - everything is a composite picture from our senses - there's something we came across in our study of comics. It's called Closure, it means the way people assemble those fragments to make reality is - well, it's different for each person.



Me: That sounds confusing as well.



Iniko: It is.



Me: Can you elaborate?



Iniko: OK, simple example. You have two eyes - your visual reality is a composite of the two different images - your mind converts the two into one simple package to process.



Me: Right.



Iniko: Almost everyone has souls - your spiritual reality is a composite of the many different ways of sensing and interacting with the universe - your mind converts them to one, a compromise package that you may not all be entirely happy with. Unless you have DID - your mind only partially merges the data, and so you remain aware of your several parts, all of which can be placated.



Me: These `parts', They're the host of people up there, Grace, Nina, and all them, no?



Iniko: Right.



Me: What do you mean by `placate' in that sense?



Iniko: A compromise by its nature is in the middle. Those on the far edges will never really be pleased with it.



Me: Who's on the far edges? Or did i take that metaphor the wrong way?



(At this point, Grace takes over.)



Grace: (There is) the left edge, active, extroverted-- the right edge, more passive, introverted-- and then the Balancers.



Me: I see. You referred to a `balance'-- did 2C-I affect this balance any?



Grace: Yes - in one way only. It made Nina - like a different person, completely came out of her shell.



Me: How so?



Grace: She's normally Very quiet. On 2C-I she was chattery and confident.



Me: Was [the trip] at any point scary?



Grace: No\ldots  (pause) Want to ask you something.



Me: Go ahead.



Grace: \ldots what would a big dose of 2C-I be like?



Me: Big, like how big?



Grace: The most you, as a friend, would be willing to let us take.



Me: The biggest I'd advise -- [given your health and] taking into account your favorable response this time - would be 17, 18 milligrams or so. You had 12 that time.



Grace: What would it be like?



Me: Much more visual, for one, and the mental aspect of it would be more `deep'.



Grace: (pause) There was time looping - to our drug-affected perception - the clock went backwards by 6-16 minutes during the peak.



Me: I've had definite time distortion, but I've never had it run backwards like that. That's very interesting.



Grace: LOVED the physical aspect, except the cold, sick tummy. Just hugging a [plush toy] was a sublime experience on it.



Me: (laughs) There's nothing better than a cuddle on 2C-I. And I find that my stomach feels `cold' as well\ldots 



At this point the topic shifted.



There has been little, if any, research done on the effects of psychedelic substances on patients with 2C-I. John later informed me that 2C-I has caused a notable, lasting sense of clarity and well-being after the initial trip, that tied into his DID. 2C-I, and related analogs, may prove to be a valuable aid to those suffering(?) from this condition.
