Just to set the context, I was with a group of friends smoking high-quality cannabis, of which I'd taken maybe 4-5 solid hits. Someone brought a box of nitrous oxide, which I'd tried once before and discounted as `like being at the dentist.' 



This time it was very different, and entirely unbelievable. I was pretty stoned and listening to the drum n bass we had playing. I took a lungful of nitrous and my whole reality suddenly disappeared, replaced foremost by what sounded like a fire alarm amplified ten times over. It was an incredible ringing bell-type cacophony, of course generated by the beat of the music, which had become much higher in pitch, subjectively. 



My nervous system felt short-circuited, and every cell screamed in unison with the constant RING RING RING RING. By this point, all that I knew existed was a plane covered with checkers composed of triangles (square = 2 triangles) colored white, black, and green, tinged with red (from my closed eyelids), the ringing panic alarm, and this feeling I identified as `pain,' or `panic' transmitted from every cell in my body. That was the whole world for a moment. No body, no concepts, no understanding. Just the wide-eyed horror of the panic alarm and the checkers. 



Suddenly, a very simple thought entered my mind: I'm being born. I suspect the component that triggered my `memory' was the feeling of horror, or panic that I had, along with the emptiness of mind. I imagine that's what most kids feel like when they're thrown from selfless suspension (like a sensory deprivation chamber) in the womb, and into the cold, bright world, lacking any understanding of what is going on, and being entirely terrified.



Then I realized, I'm in this, not my infant self. So I wondered, how do I get out? Well, where was I? Oh, a party with friends. So I should be able to come back. Just by performing the act of opening my eyes, and leaning forward. So I did. And I saw a buddy nagging me for the balloon.
