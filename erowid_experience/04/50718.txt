Subjects condition:



Subject 1: Took it very easy on the beer and smokes last night so relatively good. Slightly `just got up' feeling if anything.



Subject 2: Mild Headache and slightly unsettled stomach.



Time - 13:00



T+0mins



We've just measured out 25gms each of Peruvian Torch powder. It looks like a lot of powder to eat\ldots We're going to try taking spoonfuls then chasing with water/blackcurrant squash. 



T+30mins



After a failed attempt at consuming teaspoons full of the powder, the biggest problem with which was avoidance of inhalation of the fine dust, subject 2 hit upon the idea of form the powder into a paste, then consuming small amounts of the paste followed by water. This method was successful. So far. We now await a sign.



T+1hr 30mins



Both subjects report feeling slightly altered. Vision slightly altered though nothing definitive. Confident that the initial effects are being felt. Stomach feeling a little uncomfortable though nothing unbearable. More waves of suggestion whilst writing this.



T+2hr 10mins



Both in good spirits though no significant progress. I feel some MDMA like effects -- constant grin (especially when watching Bill Hicks), nervous excitement, the yawns.



T+2hr 55mins



No change -- Slight MDMA like effects thought nothing spectacular. Going for a walk to the shops.



T+3hrs 30min



Pleasant walk on a beautifully bright winters day. Slightly heightened awareness of colours and happily content with life.



T+5hrs



Both feeling minor buzz but not tripping per se. Having a joint to see what happens. All cool though and still enjoying the day.



T+15hrs 20mins



Going to bed now after a fair few joints, and a few beers. Still quite up but don't want to have to write off tomorrow totally. All in all a very pleasant day, akin to taking Â½ an MDMA pill which lasts for 15 hours (pretty cool!). Will try upping the dose to 40 -- 50 gms next time.
