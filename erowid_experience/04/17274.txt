   I saw a movie at national geographic called, `The cocaine mummies'. They said ancient egyptians used to ingest lotus as a narcotic drug (forgive my english; i am from Bulgaria). so i went next day to the national botanik garden secretly hoping i will find that rare flower. and o,god there it was gently showing its sheen -- my Blue lotus.I quickly looked around and with `snake style' speed the flower ended up in my pocket. Trust me there was no other way to get lotus in Bulgaria. Any way, i went home and divided the flower by two. Immersed one part in red wine and drying for smoking the other.



 So next day i drank the wine with the plant inside and smoked two hits cannabis and two hits lotus. I moved to my room which walls are beautifully decorated with shining gift paper golden and pink. It look like Salvador dali picture. Very trippy:)) Psychedelic room. I have one precious stone which i embedded into a cotton and i put it in front of my eye so that all room is looking multidimentional through the prismatic stone. And the trip began! Amazing! I looked for the swich of the music some ambient meditations and started to dance around my room during mooving everything around is shining in a sophisticated way. trust me you have to see this, psychedelicious. I felt warming in the front lobes area it was definately not the cannabis that was the mystic power of the lotus. i spend one hour floating into  hyperspatial universe of  fire lights and visual delights that make LSD-25 visuals look like a simple screen saver. I was into tunnels of light golden cities at the bottom of vast bright sea with fishes running around my eyes, that combination is cool:)). I finaly went to bathroom and find out that my body is responding on water shower like lily!!! my skin felt the water like the flower. i didnt expect that trip that great! Every drop of water is giving me life and ecstasy. I stayed one more hour inside the bathtub. It is definately a aphrodisiac. I satisfied myself two times with the water on my skin all over and on the end my clitoris was distinctive delight.



 For 7 hours i experiansed `afterglow'of well-being. i am happy normally, but that was even more intense.
