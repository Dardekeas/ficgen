Well, after reading a great deal on his board about Wormwood I ventured to try a cup of tea. Duly warned about the bitterness of the concoction I laced it with licorice root and honey. The additives barely blunted the tip of that iceberg. The Bible likens many forms of literal and figurative bitterness to Wormwood. And for good reason. I could never have prepared myself for the onslaught my taste buds would endure with the very first sip. 



Half way through the cup the bitterness hadn't subsided to any definitive degree like it might with a good, strong stout beer. It was every bit as bitter as it had been from the start. The bottom of the cup brought with it a light, clean buzz. Very light. Almost indiscernible from any psychosomatic experience I have ever undergone. So light that it most definitely wouldn't warrant another go. Wormwood, after all, isn't a tea one would sit down and enjoy with a good friend after dinner. It's nasty stuff with little discernible payoff though I didn't really expect there would be.
