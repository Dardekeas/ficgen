This isn't so much of an actual trip report, rather a general report of the effects from my use of it.



Maybe I'm just different, my brain chemistry is just a little different maybe not. Drugs have always effected me wierd. Coke has no effect what so ever other than a slight energy boost. I am not a big E person but I have to down like 5 pills to roll. Dust definatly fucks me up but in a wierd way, or so I am told by friends.



When I smoke dust I feel like I am stupified. I can feel my the liquid building up and swirling around my head as if my brain was melting. I feel very zombie or vegetable like. But when I get dusted I am cognitively more alert than I am when I am sober. In fact I can remember every little detail to the `T' as they say. I could be in a part of the country that I've only been in once before maybe like 4 years ago and still give flawless directions somehow. And this goes on till the next day or two.



The next day my vision is still all fucked up but at work I am very alert, very wired. Mentally I am what I should be like all the time, generally MUCH better than normal.



Only once has this been different. I had smoked some REALLY potent juice and I had alot of trouble remembering the simplist of things. Actually, these are things most people don't need to remember because they are just commen sense. For instance I had to refigure out and tell myself who I was, where I came from, why I was where I was, where I was going, or what money is used for etc\ldots  Basically I had to figure living out. All I could say to anyone was `I need my brain back'.
