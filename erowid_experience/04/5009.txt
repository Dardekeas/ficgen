I have used 2C-T-7 on several occasions prior to this experience, but feel that this one requires a write up because the effects were somewhat stronger than ever experienced before. I have taken a dose of 47.5mg before, without any other drugs and the experience was similar to all previous experiments. So on this occasion I decided to up the dose to 50mg. Prior to the experience, which took place in my flat, a group of nine, myself included had been to a nightclub, and had obtained some good quality pills, which unbeknownst to me beforehand contained a healthy dose of MDA. I ingested two of these before going to the club, and another one about two hours later. The 2C-T-7 was dissolved in vodka and taken approximately three hours after the final MDA tablet.



Within an hour of dosing, the initial effects could be felt. Due to the MDA, the initial speed rush and body discomfort appeared to be somewhat diminished, and the first indication that the substance was taking effect was a slight blurring of the vision and a warm feeling in the pit of the stomach.



Within another half an hour I found myself hunched over the toilet dry heaving. This always happens to me on 2C-T-7, and once I had finished being sick I sat on the bathroom floor to recover. Staring at the ironing board with a floral cover, I noticed that as usual, the sickness seemed to have stepped the trip up to the next level. All the floral prints on the board seemed to be swirling and melting, so that it was unclear exactly what they consisted of. Although I could make out the centre of the pattern, the edges seemed to be constantly expanding, contracting and rotating so that they were not of an exactly defined size. I called my friend in to the bathroom to ask how she was feeling, since she too had taken 2C-T-7. As was to be expected only 1 Â½ hours after dosing - she did not appear to be feeling any effects. We ended up sitting on the bathroom floor for quite some time, discussing life in general, and I had a great sense of feeling really close to her - not the same blissful `loved up' feeling of MDMA, but more a sense that we were both understanding what the other was saying and really valuing each others opinions.



Having decided that I was past the sickness stage, I returned to my friends in the bedroom. However, standing seemed to induce more nausea, so I decided to lay on a pile of clothes in the corner of the room. I shut my eyes and listened to the music - and WOW. This was something I had not yet experienced with this drug. The feeling of integration with the music was even stronger than that induced by MDMA, and the accompanying closed eye visuals were out of this world. Better than the open eye visuals, and better than any visuals I have ever seen on psilocybin or LSD. Mountain ranges rose and feel in time with the music. A huge sheet of metal appeared to form into a sphere, and then rotate and change colour - all in time with the music. At the same time as this my mind seemed to be full of some kind of `deeper understanding' of things. It's impossible to describe - but for a moment it felt as if I really had found the answer to life.



I was awoken from my trance by my friend announcing that she thought that she too was now tripping - and could see things melting. As I opened my eyes I found a visually stunning world awaiting me. Never before has this drug affected my eyesight this much. Usually any object with a pattern appear to melt and swirl at the edges, but now almost everything was affected. As I looked at a friend sat on the sofa, I found it impossible to define where he ended and the sofa began. The lines that ought to have defined the edge of his body were swirling, making the transition from person to sofa indistinguishable. Also, the entire room appeared to have been overlaid with some kind of warm golden tint, and for some reason I could tell that it was this golden tint which was accounting for my enourmous sense of well being. 



For the next three hours as the trip enveloped us, all my friend and I could do was talk and play silly games. As far as I was concerned the others in the room were unimportant, even non-existant. We talked and talked, and the whole time there was still this amazing sense of closeness, as if every sentence she said made perfect sense, and every stupid game she wanted to play seemed like a great idea. Time dilation appeared to be in massive effect, because by the time I realized that I had passed the peak it felt like we had been tripping for days.



The comedown was typical of all previous experiences with 2C-T-7, long and drawn out without being over heavy on the brain, leading to a short sleep ($\sim$2hours) which I awoke from feeling dazed and confused.



What to attribute this extra special reaction to I have not yet decided. It could have been the increase in dosage, but I find this highly unlikely since prior to this trip I had slowly worked the dose up from 25mg to 47.5mg without noticing any increase in effects. It could well have been due to the large dose of MDA taken beforehand, and this is something I intend to investigate in the future. My best guess, however, is the fact that for the first time I dosed with someone else. 2C-T-7 would appear to have some of the empathogenic properties of MDMA, but not nearly as pronounced.



Further experiments are clearly in order.
