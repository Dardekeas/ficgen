Smoked an unknown amount with ayahausca leaves



So, me and my friends decided to go on a 10 day hike. It was a very intense hiking trip. On day 7, after a particularly hard day of hiking, with my knee giving out, we ended up at the most beautiful campsite of the trip. Our group campsite had an outdoor, stone structure for all of us to sleep in. It was a beautiful, clear day, clear night, with more stars than I had ever seen (6000ft altitude). I knew that this was the place to experiment with the MET.



I brought about 150 mg's total with me, and it was split between 6 people. I was worried that the chemical may have gone bad during the hike, but it looked fine. I decided to take the first test dosage, to make sure that none of my friends would die. I used ayahausca leaves as a base, and I put a little bit of the powder on an ayahausca leaf in my pipe, and inhaled the compound, slowly melting the powder. I waited a few minutes, didn't really feel anything. So after that I decided to load a larger bowl onto another piece of ayahausca leaf. After taking a few large hits and holding my breath, I felt the threshold effects. Basically, I just felt very warm and comfortable. It was very calm, very chill, but not powerful at all. When I closed my eyes, I saw very mild hallucinations, but that lasted less than 15 minutes. Overall just felt a warmth from within my chest and very relaxed. 



So, we just passed the pipe around, loading bowls until we had finished all 150 mgs. My friends who had done DMT before said it felt like the afterglow of DMT. Another one of my friends said ``it felt like a psychedelic blanket''. Afterwards, we all decided to lay out where we could see the stars, and one of my friends said the stars were moving around. 



Overall, it was a very mild, calming, and pleasant experience. Within the context of our hiking trip, it really improved my mind-state, and I don't think I would have been able to finish the hike without that mood boost! The pipe I used was pretty shitty, and the MET had survived through harsh conditions, so that may have contributed to the mildness. I will explore this compound further, using a better smoking device. I highly doubt there will be the ``rush'' of DMT or powerful psychedelic experience, but we'll see!
