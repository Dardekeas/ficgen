I started this out in the name of pure scientific knowlegde. My plan: to document the effects of a daily dose of salvia for spiritual/mental health purposes. Everyday at about the same time, around 10 PM, I smoked a bowel of salvia divinorum leaf. Everyday I got the same effect, a sense of well being and feelings of connection. I also got a slight taste of the salvia body high. I continued this for a total of 2 weeks.



About halfway through the first week my mood seemed very up, nobody seemed to notice anything different about my character and I felt more in contact with the gods, the earth, people, animals, everything. By the end of the first week my recollection starts to get hazy. I still felt in very high spirits, but my friends said I was acting a little odd, randomly blurting out whatever popped into my head. They all seemed to enjoy it and I enjoyed myself too.



Halfway through the second week my thinking and memory was extremely erratic but never dangerous. I can't quite remember my state of mind during that time but I know I was considering giving up on the experiment. At the end of the second week I ended the experiment when a friend expressed concern for my well being. We had smoked some weed and during my high there was a time where I layed back onto the couch, my eyes rolled back into my head and I suddenly exclaimed MASHED POTATOES! I preceded to be barely reachable for the next 30 minutes. I remember smoking the pot but don't remember that half an hour.



My thinking was erratic for the next 3-4 days or so but it eventually went back to normal. I guess here is where I make my conclusions but personally I don't want to influence you, the reader, either way on trying what I did. Just be careful.
