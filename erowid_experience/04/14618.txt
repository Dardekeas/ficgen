I learned from several online sources about the Passionflower and its abiity to cause a high when ingested or smoked. So I went to my garden and picked a several flowers. I then pulled of all their petals and left them to dry under sunlight for a day. I further boiled them in lemon juice and repeated the drying process. After I crushed the petals up I weighed the material in at 65grams. I then loaded my Sherlock and toked up. After finishing the 33grams I weighed out, I sat down outside feeling sort of like I had just burned up some opium; yet that wasn't close enough, the feeling was reminiscent of marijuana as well, and the feeling that hit me then reminded me of creeper weed. I zoned out staring at a poppy in my garden that had a insex in the center of it. I went inside and played some video games and was back at baseline 4 hrs after I had toked up. I will try this again maybe I will make some tea from it then smoke a little more than I did this time. I wouldn't try this with weed because its effects would probably over welm the high from passiflora.
