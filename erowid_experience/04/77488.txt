After having rather mixed feelings about my last (and first) trip with 2C-D (that report can be found here), I decided to give it another go.



I actually did not measure the amount I took. Over the course of the evening I guess I took around 40mg of this substance.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\#  On that Saturday late afternoon I poured what I would have guessed was 20-30mg of the chemical into a cup of green tea and drank it very slowly. It took me around 45 minutes to finish the cup. I did not feel anything around 30 minutes after finishing the tea so I decided to snort some of the powder. I took about 10-15mg and snorted it in small chunks with breaks of around  15 minutes in between. When I finished about half of the `line' it was about 8PM on that evening.



I was on the computer working on a song and chatting with some friends online when I started to feel the effects. Like the last time I started to see very blurry and my eyes were watering as if I would ride a bike downhill in full speed on a cold day. It was hard to read and my eyes felt like they were wrapped in cotton wool. It got harder and harder to concentrate on my music work since my brain somehow got `dumb'. Like the last time. I started to get some rushes of anxiety and I became more and more nervous since my sight got even more blurred.



At this point I had to stop working on my music because the work was just too complex for my brain to `get' at this point. My left arm started to hurt with every minute. The interesting thing was, that in my right arm I did not feel any pain at all. The pain in my arm fueled my anxiety and I got even more nervous. 



Until this point (and actually through the whole trip) I did not have any visual hallucinations of any kind. Instead, a major splitting headache announced itself. All the effects I had were purely physical. My palms were sweating profoundly and I had trouble to understand the chat I was having with my online friend.



About 1-2 hours after feeling the first effects I remembered that I had to go downstairs and get the my washed laundry out of the washing machine. Because my left arm felt very cold and hurt very much I went to the bathroom to see how I looked. When I turned on the light and saw my left arm I was shocked. 



The veins in the arm were dark blue colored and literally popping out of my arm. I felt every single vein in my arm as if liquid metal would flow through. The pain was really strong and I thought for a few seconds to call the ambulance. I rushed to the kitchen and flushed the rest of the line of 2C-D I had prepared.



I wanted to drink some juice and tried to grab the glass which was standing about 1 meter before me. Apparently the 2C-D must have altered my spatial perception because when I tried to grasp the glass my hand just missed it and passed it by $\sim$30 centimeters. My second attempt was more successful. After downing the juice I went downstairs and got my laundry. On the way down I suddenly felt a rather disturbing muscle spasm in my chest on the left side. I felt very concerned because of this relatively massive amount of physical negative side effects I had so far. I was confused for what appeared to me like forever and I hardly could do much more than very easy tasks. 



Still on my way down to get the laundry my ears started to pop. The same feeling as if you are in an airplane starting or landing. That in-ear pressure popping repeated on a 5-minute basis from this point on. It was like my brain manually tried to adjust the ear-pressure. The ear popping continued for about 2 hours. After I managed to get my laundry to my apartment I decided to go for a walk because I felt very uneasy from the first minute I started to feel the effects of this substance. Quick check in the bathroom to see how my hurting arm is doing. The veins looked still horribly swollen and dark blue. 



I rushed outside in hope that the walk and cold air would lessen the physical effects. The 30 minute walk actually helped quite a lot. When I returned I felt slightly better but still off. At least I had a clearer head now and my blurred vision subsided. The occasional muscle spasms in my chest, the splitting headache and the ear pressure-popping still remained, though.



I browsed on random websites for another hour or so. At this point it was 11:30pm. I could not believe that only 3.5 hours had passed! The trip felt like 6-8 hours to me even though in reality it was only around 3 hours. After that I went to bed and fell asleep easily. I did not have any dreams at all that night.



The next morning I woke up rested and with no hangover but with the same major pain in my left arm which developed the day before. The veins still looked dark blue and were very visible. The left arm felt very cold compared to my right arm and I literally could feel every single vein. The pain remained until the following Tuesday. Today - five days after the ingestion - I still have a very cold left hand and got a distinct pain in the fingertips on my left hand. 



This trip absolutely did not have any positive effects on me and I feel like this chemical definitely can not be healthy to the human body with all the physical negative effects it brings with it. I'm quite sure I will not try this drug anytime soon - if ever - again.
