After a great experience with taking 25 mg orally of generic Adderall, I decided to experiment with combining it with Benadryl in order to avoid the insane drowsiness that accompanies ingesting large amounts of Benadryl.  So I took 29 pills, or 725 mg, of Diphenhydramine.  I gave it a good hour and a half to kick in, since I planned to snort the Adderall so it would act immediately.  When I began to feel the `small hands' feeling, a personal tell-tale sign that I am feeling full effects of the Diphenhydramine, I crushed and snorted the five 5mg pills of Adderall.  



I expected the drowsiness to go away, and most likely some of the lethargy that also accompanies ingestion of Diphenhydramine, while leaving the visual and auditory hallucinations that I desired.  What actually happened was completely unbelievable.  It was as if the amphetamines cancelled the Benadryl out COMPLETELY.  I couldn't believe it.  I felt COMPLETELY sober.  I decided to give it time, that maybe the Diphenhydramine just hadn't started giving me any hallucinations.  After about half an hour of feeling completely sober, I decided to go to sleep.  I brushed my teeth just like any other sober night and went to sleep.  I fell asleep jacked up on 25 mg of amphetamines with no tolerance.  



I don't know what it is about these two drugs, but they seem to cancel each other out.  I don't know what it is about this combination, but I did not expect anything like that. It's really weird that it cancels out any visual or auditory hallucinations.



Summary:  I took Benadryl and amphetamines in an effort to stay awake and ended up feeling 100\% sober for a half hour.  Went to sleep like normal.
