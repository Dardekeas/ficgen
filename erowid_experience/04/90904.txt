This report is to document a recent ++++ experience using oral Syrian rue combined with vaporized Anadenanthera Peregrina. I have worked multiple times with this combination over the past three years and have found it to be a fairly reliable tool for generating very strong +++ and ++++ experiences -- especially when combined with transcendental meditation. 
   
As far as myself\ldots  I am 6'2'' at 260 lbs over 40 years old. I tend to be a bit of a hard head with certain substances so my dosage level is usually fairly high. I have been researching altered states for 20 years with the most intense research being done in the last 6 years. My interest in this field of study has been  increasing steadily with each venture into the great mystery. I added meditation to my tool bag 12 years ago and this mental training has helped me stay steady in states of mind that could turn a persons hair white.

Time sequence is as follows: Friday night I ground 2 grams of rue in the mortar, this was capsulized and consumed at 8:00 pm Friday, I stopped eating food at 6pm. Saturday morning 4grams of rue was ground, capsulized and consumed at 10:30am (note: I have found that more then 4 grams of rue at a sitting can tox me out a bit so this is the reason I stacked them overnight for a total of 6 grams rue.) 

At 11:am a bowl of fine green bud was vaporized in the volcano. 

At 11:15am 15 Anadenanthera Peregrina seeds were deshelled and crushed in the mortar then placed into the volcano; this may seem like a lot of seed but the volcano has a large bowl to fill :) 4 full bags of vapor were smoked, stirring the seed between each bag -- the volcano was set at the hottest level to cook the seeds. The initial effects are felt after only the second puff of the first bag -- a feeling of prickly heat matched with a slight head shift. This grows into a feeling of being poisoned, increased heart beat, heat and bone crushing nausea. 

For me this comes on at about 3 minutes and leaves at about minute 8 -- it is an intense but short lived sickness ( I have noticed that using a vaporizer lessens the duration and intensity of the nausea when compared to burning the material in a pipe or bong) Once the 4th bag was finished I moved to the bed, sitting upright with my bucket and with my two dogs for company\ldots   

The meditation began as soon as my eyes closed. The CEV's were rapidly pulsing and split into two distinct visions for the ``on'' and ``off'' pulse. One pulse was luminous tubes making incredible geometric patterns on the back of my eyelids in a soft orange glow. The other pulse was white light luminous with every color mixed in -- I could see shapes moving in every direction very quickly. These two views were flickering faster and faster, my eyes were in rapid REM,  I found I could chose to focus on one or the other view. 

I chose to look more deeply into the white light and shapes moving in it. I don't really recall a transition but I then found myself floating in deep space with tiny glowing threads  squiggling far below me -- I moved rapidly toward these ``threads'' and soon I learned that these were not threads but huge electric serpents with faceted black diamond eyes. There were hundreds of them all around me, and despite how incredible this was I remained strangely detached. 

One serpent came really close- it was huge- it could have swallowed me whole , I will never forget the glint off its deep black faceted eye as it looked right through me. After the meditation was complete, in retrospect, I am awed by its ancient feeling of wisdom but at the time of the meditation my mind was silent and non-judgmental. For me this seems to be a trait of the rue/anadenanthera meditation combination, unlike nn-dmt where the takeoff is artificial rocket ship like, the yopo seems more like a fast car made of wood ( meaning it has a more nature feel to the experience.) The transition out of this space was abrupt with me giving three big dry heaves into my bucket. (These heaves came on fast and without much warning so have your bucket handy! ) The nausea that brought on the heaves left as quickly as it came on.

I then settled into the second phase of the journey which consisted of me flying fast through ``word constructs'', these where complete 3-d cities, tunnels and shapes made of words. The words were tightly spaced and all different colors -- I was moving to fast to read the words and it is difficult to convey how the words were creating the space I was in. The third and final phase of the meditation consisted of molecule land, super bright molecule jewels combining with each other in strange shapes and moving in that strange DMT type way. This is not the first time I have been down with the molecules -- it is a fascinating place -- the molecules even communicate with you in that unique already knowing telepathy. I have even seen atoms in this space but for some reason they appear like black specks on a luminous white background with no color at all. When I finally came out of the meditation and looked at the clock it was 1:45pm. Total time two and a half hours. The detached feeling left me and I reflected in amazement at the experience. I felt sedated the rest of the day similar to two xanax. I slept well that night and awoke refreshed Sunday.

In retrospect the experience re-iterated previous lessons in that once again I was shown that everything is made of a single consciences, and that no matter how small to atoms or large to galaxies the pure creative energy forms intelligence at every level. The very molecules themselves are alive and self aware. I feel humble and grateful to be able to peak behind the curtain of the great mystery, I hope this report helps others to do the same. I want to thank Erowid and its contributors for paving the path of knowledge that I and others have walked down.
