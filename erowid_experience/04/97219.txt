We discovered 4-MEC when browsing a certain research chemical vendor's catalog. After reading some reports me and three friends decided that 4-MEC was worth the experiment, and so we bought three grams total and shared the compound between the four of us was going to be a very peculiar evening.



Before I delve into the night-long experience itself, here's a list of most, if not all of the psychoactives I have taken: Cannabis, LSD, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Alcohol, Methoxetamine, DXM, Salvia, Methylphenidate (Ritalin), 2C-E, Nitrous Oxide and various types of spice product. This is just a quick list, I am sure there are more that I am just not thinking of right now.



The four of us prepared for the ``taste test'' of the 4-MEC by making sure there would be no disturbances. The four of us were the only ones around, all of us excited and ready to test the compound. We were all mentally and physically sound, no medical or psychological conditions present in any of us. However, one of my friends suggested we do a small 1-2mg allergy test before we ingest bigger doses, I told him that wasn't necessary, and in hindsight it was an irresponsible decision on my part.



T+ 0:00 All four of us snort bumps approximately 150mg in size. We all relax and listen to music and wait for effects. We would give the compound 1/2 an hour and if we felt nothing, we would each bump an extra 20mg. Immediately after we bumped the 4-MEC we would have casual discussion about our previous experiences with other compounds to make time pass while we come up.

	

T+ 0:15 There it was. A body-rush, somewhat akin to my experiences with Methylphenidate/Ritalin. My blood felt warm and quickly pumping. It was a great feeling, I felt as if I could perceive all of my organs taking care of my bodily functions in perfect harmony. An odd form of stimulant euphoria, I was care-free. This feeling was similar to Methylphenidate/Ritalin, but I did not feel focused, or that incentive to be productive like I do on prescription uppers. We all came up within the same fifteen-minute time frame, as we were all of very different weights and metabolisms.



T+ 0:30 We all felt the same, powerful rush that seemed to relax our minds and stimulate our bodies.

	

T+ 0:45 We all agreed, we were starting to come down gradually, and we took note that 4/5 of the 4-MEC was still left. So we each took another 150mg.

	

T+ 0:55 Quickly was the initial euphoria recaptured. We all agreed that this compound was great when used recreationally, and considered pitching in for more once this bag was finished. 



This process repeated. We would come up and then down, redose. Relax. Then come down, and then redose again. The bag became skimpy by the latter half of the night, leaving us with one final dose of euphoria per person.



We all took our favorite walk when we got bored. It was especially fun when intoxicated, we referred to this walk as our ``ritual walk'', because it was a beautiful and interesting experience when you're not sober. At the climax of the walk, we reach a bridge that goes over a highway that is rarely busy at night. However, it was no longer night, it was approaching 6 AM and it was progressively getting lighter out. We relaxed, sitting on the bridge, with one final dose for each of us.



T+5:30 The bag was gone. We were all euphoric and rushing once again, and it was getting late, so it was a great time to head off and crash. We got home as quickly as possible, it was an exhausting trip.



As I came down completely from 4-MEC, I felt the typical upper crash. I was grinding my teeth, I was getting tired, and a tad cranky. Nonetheless, it was very enjoyable.



T +6:00 I was out cold. I slept for about 8 hours.



Waking up in the afternoon, I discussed with my friends the recreational merit of 4-MEC. They said they would consider buying more in the future, and I agreed. A slight hangover feeling was noted, I felt slightly sore for a few hours which is typical for myself after being on stimulants for a while. We all felt fine, except for my one friend who started vomiting a few hours after waking up. He said he felt as if he had caught the flu, and the only logical conclusion was that it was from the 4-MEC because all of us were in perfect health. The 4-MEC may have reacted with something he ate, or he is more prone to this type of hangover. The cause of his illness is unknown.



This compound definitely should be studied in a formal laboratory in the near future, as it is quite an interesting one. Beware though, it is very easy to crave and overdo, and also fairly easy to obtain where I reside.
