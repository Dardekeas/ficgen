I bought a quarter of a gram from an on-line site.  Had it for about a week before I had a chance to try it and was very excited, had been researching it for awhile.  Was at the time a very experienced psychedelic enthusiast, been to many Grateful Dead shows, never had a bad experience.  I had tried Salvia on several occasions as well.  



I placed a tiny amount in a bowl, no one around.  Put the flame to it and it really freaked me out.  Had no visuals whatsoever, but noticed that I could see with my eyes closed.  For some reason this really scared me.  Didnt like this feeling AT ALL.  I suddenly starting thinking that maybe I had been crazy my whole life and that it took this for me to realize it.  I really started to panic now and jumped up out of my seat, then started repeting to myself `I don't like this!'.  My heart started to beat uncontrollably and started to think I should go to the house, I thought I was dying, my whole life flashed before my eyes, as I prepared to walk into the house and tell my dad I thought I was having a heart-attack.  I could see myself in the hospital with my family standing around crying.  I was trying to decide rather to walk in or to die.  Right about then I turned towards the road and started talking myself down.  Within a few minutes I could tell I was coming down. It took about a half hour to come all the way and I set by self and contimplated my entire life.



I decided then to never do hallucinogens again and consider myself lucky I been on as many successful journeys that I had been!  My friend had a good experience, but it was scary to me.  He laid there kind of like he was in a coma or something.  I say stay away from this drug!  Like it says it can bring heaven or hell.  I experienced TERROR.  Dont take your chances, do something that is tried and true like LSD, mescaline, or mushrooms in a nice happy environment and you will better off either way.  Good luck intrepid travelers!
