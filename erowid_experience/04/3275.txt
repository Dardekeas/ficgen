I would just like to express a brief note of caution. Although regulations require medical products to list the medical ingredients of their product, in Canada they won't neccesarily put the `buffer' chemical on the list. This buffer chemical is the one that makes you throw up violently if you accidently ingest `too much' to stop little kids from accidently killing themselves (or adults too, I suppose). Of course, if you're using a chemical recreationally then this buffer will almost certainly get in the way. 



This may be why a number of people have reported ill effects from cough remedies which \_appeared\_ to contain only DXM. I have personally used DXM with no undesirable effects several times, then, after switching brands (to the generic one none the less!) I became violently sick and had uncontrollable diarheah when taking a trivial dose (300mg DXM HBr) I guess the moral of the story would be to try out a new brand at low levels and see if you can feel evidence of a buffer before subjecting yourself to 5-6 hours of nausia and delerium.
