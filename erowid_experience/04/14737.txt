It was Friday. Singer was coming over. When he got to my house he pulled out two grams of KB and we smoked a few bowls in singer's car. A few minutesn later we began to talk. We were talking about theories that were having like how our soul is the radiation of the energy we give off.



Later that night we went over to singer's car. When we were in the car Singer asked if I wanted some ritalin. I snorted four pills and washed the drip down with some vodka. I chilled in his car comtemplating how we are able to percieve everything, think, and take drugs. I began to think we all came from one single source of energy that was so massive that it was able to spawn planets, I stars, and life. As singer dove away as I stodd in my , I paused to have a cigerete. When I finished My jack, I went in my house to watch T.V. Watching the science chanel began to feel as though everyrthing was perfect and I was at my zen.
