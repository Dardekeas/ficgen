I count myself as being reasonably experienced with various stims and psychodelics on the UK market and having got a bit bored of MDMA and not quite being in the mood for any of the TC family or speed and not being flush enough for some decent coke I was pretty interested when a friend introduced me to MDPV and described its effects as a mix of coke and MDMA but without the jitteriness of coke and none of the muscle tension and more subtle than MDMA. 



After doing a little research into others experiences and dosages I decided to give it a go at a 5mg dosage and enjoyed it quite a bit. Similar experiences at dosages ranging from 5mg - 20mg over periods of 5hrs - 12hrs [upto 40mg] and I was starting to see why my friend had recommended it to me.



So when informed that a few friends were organising a party out in the woods that promised to be good I decided to take some along and see what MDPV would be like in that sort of enviroment.



Having recently had a bit of a problem weening myself off of ketamine, I decided that this would be ideal for a more `connected' feel and wanted to be able to chat and see some friends I hadn't seen in a while.

It was a good choice.



The initial onset seemed to be within the first 10-15mins of a powdered nasal hit of about 10-12mg. A definate boost in energy and mild euphoria, I found myself chatting and smiling a lot before deciding after about 30mins of ingestion that the dancefloor was looking VERY enticing! 



I really enjoyed dancing and became quite playful with friends also dancing. I enjoyed the selection of D'n'B, psytrance, breakbeats and dubstep being played more than some others who were on more MDMA or ketamine and I didn't want to stop dancing til the effects started to drop off after about 3hrs. I spent a while longer moving around the party chatting and having a laugh with friends before the lingering effects wore off and finally deciding another 12mg hit was in order about an hour later.



This seemed to bring me back up to pretty much the same point as before, possibly slightly elevated levels of euphoria, but none of the anxiety mentioned by others and within 20mins I was back on the floor shaking my ass, grinning my head off and having a lot of fun! About 30mins later the sun was up and it was a beautiful morning, I started having a hankering for some LSD, I ingested a drop of liquid, followed by another about 2hrs later which seemed to mix nicely with the MDPV.



I waited another 5-6hrs after my second hit of MDPV to do my third and final hit of the day as by now I was starting to want another quite a bit. This time a friend did me a corner by eye that was probably closer to 15-20mg. I have a very high tolerance to things and found this to be a good hit for me by this point (I had been up for about 24hrs by now), plus not too sure on absolute quality of supply, so be careful and try lower dosages for first time experiences.



I continued to vary between wanting to chat, effects similar to coke and wanting to dance and move around in a more relaxed MDMA manner.



By now, other friends who were also trying MDPV were also reporting how much fun they were having and the general consensus of opinion was that this was a definately good thing for the party scene as it kept people on the ball and made the party as a whole a lot more of an involved, lively and happier night. This time the affects lasted for about 5-6hrs total and it wasn't til I got home that the come down kicked in. Note that I hadn't had time to eat properly before the party and as I'd been moving house, hadn't had much sleep and by now had been up for almost 30hrs (stupid I know on any stim), so the come down was quite hard, unlike other times I've experienced this drug. I just felt very drained and tired, but still very alert, although not quite wired in the same jittery way that MDMA can produce, just unable to shut down.



I found that eating a good meal and some multi-vits really helped along with 20mg of valium to get me off to sleep, although I can imagine that without the valium sleep would have been difficult. You really do have to look after yourself before doing a long one on MDPV and lots of complex carbs is probably a good idea.



All in all a very pleasent experience and one I hope to try again, although this time with more rest and food before!

Hope this is helpful.
