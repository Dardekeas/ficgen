I was at a pals on Thanksgiving and a friend of ours called. I talked to him for a few minutes. During our conversation he had asked if I wanted to trip with him. I picked him up and we went to another persons place and this is when it started. He handed me about 1 gram of these seeds and a little baggie which contained about 1 to 1. 5 grams of the bark of this plant. It did not taste bad but about 45 minutes later I was seeing visuals so real I could not tell if I was dreaming or not. We ended up leaving there not knowing how bad these visuals would get. I got lost driving and had no clue who, when, or where I was. I seen people in the roads and slammed the breaks, needless to say there was nothing there. I got home, not knowing how, and went straight to sleep. 



The next day I go to work but I am still seeing things and the tickets that have the food orders on them were all running together and I could not think. I got sent home and went straight to bed. I woke up and had too comprhend this drug. Going on 2 days later and things up close are still blurry. I hope this all goes away. I would have enjoyed this expierence if I was not driving and around more people who were eating this stuff. If the chance arrives for another to take this PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont drive and make sure you are in a safe place. . . . . .
