I recently aquired a gram of 4-ho-dipt, and have been experimenting with a variety of dosages and administration methods.  No information was available on either smoking or insufflating this particular tryptamine, so I decided it might be valuable to make the attempt, in an effort to further knowledge of the substance.  I expected 4-ho-dipt to be active intranasally, but I figured that, since it is reportedly heat sensitive, smoking it might not be effective.  I was encouraged by reports of people smoking magic mushrooms to good effect, however, and was pleasantly suprised by the results:  I am having a little difficulty typing in fact, my embeded mental routines seem to be a bit disrupted.



First, an account of the nasal route.  3 days ago, I measured out about 20mg of the grayish powder, divided it into two piles, and sucked it up through a rolled up twenty (why not experiment in style?)  The dose is very approximate, I have no scale and simply divided my supply into successively smaller amounts.  I have found this particular substance to be very mild, almost to the point of being boring, so I wasn't particularly concerned with getting too much.  When I have taken this tryptamine orally, the primary effects have been a noticable mood lift, loosened inhibitions, and a little amplification of color.  My body feels fuzzy and less present, and touch is changed in a bizzare fashion; it becomes less precise and sensitive, but more pronounced (what I do feel is amplified in significance).  



The alteration of thought is very subtle, but definitely there, and consists of some mental confusion, along with a quiet centeredness and a sense that all is right and in order, a feeling of peace and unity with the world.  This is not dramatic, like the loss of self and diffusion into the world I experience with things like lsd or dpt, but is very nice, and is the primary reason I have continued to experiment with this chemical.  



When taken nasally, however, this centered mental state was brief, and obscured by the other effects.  A new quality was also evident:  a pronounced flanging or stoning of vision.  This flanging was very similar to the flanging I get with marihuana, but only affected my vision, not my sense of time or my thoughts like with pot.  Unfortunately, the brightening of colors that accompanied the oral route was missing.  The body sensations were increased, I felt quite detached and a little tense.  Onset was much quicker, effects were felt within 5 minutes, peaked around 10, and were gone in about an hour.



Just an hour ago, I tried smoking the 4-ho-dipt.  The dose was, once again, about 20mg.  I poured it into a cigarette that had some of the tobbaco emptied out, ripped off the filter, then smoked the cigarette.  The smoke is pretty mild, and has a barely perceptible chemical flavor sort of like other smoked tryptamines.  I was hit almost immediately with the effects, probably about half way through the cigarette.  The visual flanging was even more pronounced this way, and there was no brightening of colors.  I felt energy welling up inside me, as if I had smoked 5-meo-dmt, but not as strong, and a brief but intense sense of unity and rightness with the world.  I only felt this unity if I thought about it, if I was focusing on the visual effects it was entirely absent.  The body feeling was primarily one of disassociation, without the funny distortions of touch.  The peak of the experience lasted maybe 5 minutes, and I was pretty much down in another 10.



This chemical seems to be largely what you choose to make of it.  If I decide to focus on personal interaction, dialogue and interpersonal connection are beautiful and charged with meaning.  If I decide to focus on the world around me, the world itself and my surroundings are charged with meaning.  If I decide to look for visuals, mild visuals become evident.  If I think about touching things, then touch becomes intense and fascinating.  Overall, I think the oral route is the best.  It lasts longer, and the effects seem to be more interesting, better suited to exploring ones inner world or the environment.  I think that smoking might provide some interesting results in combination with marihuana or nitrous, or else at a higher dose; in fact, if the dose was high enough I could see it leading to complete divorce from the world and a trip into the white light, it has the same propulsive feel as 5-meo-dmt, but I think the dose would be very high if it wasn't in conjunction with something else.  It might work really well smoked while on a low dose of ketamine or DXM.



I think that certain psychedelics take you by the hand and lead you where they want you to be, like dmt, mescaline, lsd, or many of the other traditional entheogens.  Others, notably 5-meo-dmt, merely provide a resevoir of psychic fuel that must be channeled into some purpose or act of the will.  I think most of my bad trips on 5-meo have been when I have taken it without a strong will towards something, and the energy just builds without an outlet, leading to physical sickness and a feeling that I'm about to explode, TERROR!  On the other hand, when taken with confidence and a will towards entering the mercy of God, I am given the fuel to realize my wish and am permited to touch the hem of the Divine Unity.  Or when taken with a will towards physical pleasure, the body screams in continuous orgasm.  4-ho-dmt is the same, but perhaps with less of the quality of fuel and more of the quality of lubricant.  I must still will myself to where I wish to be, but the action is easier and I don't continually slide back because of the thousand random thoughts and distractions the mind ordinarily presents.  



I don't think it could propel me into the presence of God, but if I took enough, I could will myself there gradually but steadily.  Some mental energy is provided, and the trip is made easy.  I would like to take the two chemicals together; it might ease the uncertainty and roughness while the 5-meo laid out the universe like parchment before the candle of thought.
