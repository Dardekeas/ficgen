Well dear friends, I have a solid history using every drug known to man. However, when I decided to look for an opiate to use which doesn't cause an addiction from hell, Buprenex fell into my lap.



I saw all the posts on the net about how Buprenex is used to treat Heroin and other opiate addiction.  In addition, I noticed that it was also a drug of abuse in Europe, especially France, BAM! I had an idea.



After days of searching I finally found a Mexican dude who sold the stuff.  And better yet, it was the injectabe type.  I received my order a few days later.  Needless to say I was very excited.



I shot the stuff into one of the few veins I have left, my leg.  All the other ones are gone due to years of abuse.



I felt a mild tingly feeling, but nothing like the rush of shooting heroin or oxyontin.



Then about 15 minutes later I had the most glorious mild opiate high I had ever experienced.  Not only was that pleasing but I felt all the anxiety and depression of my work and life stresses lifted.



It was like a nice dose of vicodin and xanax all working together.



I didn't feel the powerful nod, or extreme euphoria of heroin or morphine. Instead, this high was honest and pleasent lasting for hours.



The next day I still felt very positive and upbeat.



Buprenex withdrawals are the only opiate withdrawals anyone can tolerate.



The only problem is the stuff is expensive \$25 per vial and hard to get.



Keeping it real up in da field arigh, RAHJEN BLACK RECOVERY GURU
