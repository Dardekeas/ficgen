At 1 P.M. I took four prescription meclizine at 25 mg each. I felt the effects in about an hour. Overall its a very calming, chill, relaxed thing. However, every once in awhile I was seized by paranoia lasting no more than 2 minutes. I reached several peaks and had just about as much of a more elevated high, as I did with a semi-constant `standard' high. 



I woke up around nine the next morning and I was still feeling the effects of the meclizine, it was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the day and whenever I could I hung out in the sun, which definetly incresed the high. Another great thing to do on meclizine, as with most drugs, was to just chill and listen to music. Around 5 P.M. the day after I took it I experienced an abrupt crash, but really I just sort of returned to normal very quickly. It was easy to hide at that dosage and I was still a functioning member of society only with a few perks. Overall it was very enjoyable and I look forward to the next time.
