I got a hold of 3 Ketogan suppositories. They each contained 10 mg ketobemidone.



I took one during an evening I was a little bored and layed flat on the bed waiting for the pill to take its effects. As I then proceeded to sit in my chair, I slowly began feeling a lift in my mood. A very euphoric feeling, very intensely content and relaxed. All in all it had been around 30 minutes since I `plugged' the pill.



I proceeded to pack a bowl of weed and smoked it. I have never felt better in my life. I was sinking into the chair, everything was just great and bright. I sat for myself thinking about how lucky I am, and how grateful I should be for all these wonderful drugs. Truly amazing for such a low dose. I peaked around two and a half hours into the high, just sitting and chatting with my fellow drug enjoyers over IRC. 



There was no real itch either, as I have experienced with other opioids. No vomiting either. No real drowsiness (might be my low dose). Also, when I do methadone, I puke like mad the day after, but not with the ketogan.



Compared to hydromorphone, this opioid is vastly superior (I've only insufflated hydromorphone though) and compared to methadone, it's also a lot better. It relaxes me just as much, but it makes me so much more happy.



Great stuff.
