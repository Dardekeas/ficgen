After being prescribed provigil, I found it to often be everything that drugs like Ritalin and Adderall claimed to be. At an initial dose of 200mg, I didn't really feel much of a change from the initial SSRI/amphetamine combo I was smoothing out. While suppressing my appetite a bit I still felt as prone to have sleepy moments during the day, although I felt more alert when wakeful. My doctor recommended trying as many as 3 or 4 tablets (600-800mg), early in the morning to attempt to prevent those sleepier moments from kicking in. I didn't notice much of a change until I hit 800mg. During the day I would get periods of moderate euphoria and a very intense `good' feeling, I would often smile deeply. The world seemed to quiet down and flatten somewhat. However, after a time, this feeling stopped coming as easily, and I had to keep upping the dose to get it back, until I hit the 1000mg mark, and decided to keep it down a little more.
