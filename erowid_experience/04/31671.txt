I was prescibed Wellbutrin Sr at 150mg twice a day by my gynecologist for smoking cessation and to alleveate moods swings that I had complained about.  It did nothing for the smoking.  But my moods leveled out quite noticeably, according to my husband. After about 2 months I noticed the mood stabilizing effect wearing off, I was becoming irratable easily again.

On the night in question, a simple misunderstanding between my husband and me set off a fight. Unfortunately at the time, he was drunk, and I was sober and the argument took a turn for the worse, resulting in a screaming match, then I physically attacked him, and lastly, ingested approximately 3000mg of my wellbutrin. Of course once I had done so, I realized what a mistake that was and got online to look up what the overdose symptom would be.  What I found frightened me, rapid heartbeat and heart failure. I called 911 and told them what I had done, unfortunately they led me to believe that it was not a big deal, and I should go to the hospital only if my heartrate seemed elevated.  Of course they sent out an ambulance anyway. I told the paramedics what I had told 911. The police were there due to the domestic side of it. They advised me not to stay in the house with my husband as they did not want to come out again, and since I did not want to go to the hospital, I reassured the officer that we would just stay away from each other for the night.  The paramedics told me I should be ok, I would probably just sleep very well, but if I felt like my heartrate was elevated at any time I should go to the emergency room. So they left.

My husband kept at me after they left, I was in a bad state of mind so I drank a beer (which I promised the paramedic I would NOT do. Our argument calmed down a bit, and since we had company (my husband's co-worker was visiting us) we all sat down and just hung out for a while.  

This is when the hallucinations started.

Now, I have never taken acid, the only drug I've ever tried are marijuana and cocaine. But I have been around many other people who have.  I was shocked when I started to see things that I knew were hallucinations.  Being an extremely logical thinker, I decided to sit back and enjoy the trip, and began describing everything to my husband and his friend. Colors became vivid and I was seeing what seemed to be a moving grid of light flowing horizontally towards me. And occasionally there were `things' on the grid.  I found that when I touched objects, that influenced what I saw. Even if I closed my eyes I could still see it, only more vivid against the black background of my closed eyes.  Now I am a heavy reader (mostly horror) so I thought it would be a grand experiment to go `touch' my books to see if that did anything, it did, the vision got wilder.

Now I know during this time I opened about 3 cans of beer, but according to my husband I didn't drink them, we found them later, full.  I must assume the visions got worse, or that I slipped farther into them, because from this point on, my memories vary from what actually happened. My husband's friend went to bed in the guest room and my husband went to bed. I remember that I thought they were trying to hide, and I had a hard time recognizing my house, like I kept flashing in and out of the trip.  I found out later I was banging on the guest room door trying to get in and my husband forcibly put me to bed. At this point I went to bed with my husband, but stayed awake and still tripping wildly.  Flashing in and out out the `real world'. Many times I imagined my husband was dead and lying in bed next to me. I kept reaching over and waking him to realize it was not real. Which pissed him off. Finally I got so manic and felt my heart racing. I got out of bed and frantically searched for a watch to take my pulse. I found it to be very elevated. I got in my truck and was going to drive to the hospital. I took a wrong turn in my neighbohood and got lost. (I'm new here and getting lost would be easy sober.)   \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 

From here thing get very fuzzy. I recal driving like a maniac and turning aroung in many driveways trying to find my way out. Stopping periodically and hopping out to walk to the street sign to view it and figure out where I was. At one point I saw another car, lights on, and parked, I even stopped to ask them for directions. And from here thing go continually downhill. Everything I remember was in a dream, and made no sense. I vaguely remember ambulances and going to the hospital and being asked who did this to me? Did what? I was bruised up all over and had scratches all over my face and torso, blood in my teeth on my face\ldots  etc.  I continued to have hallucinations all through the night and morning in the emergency room then was admitted to the psyche ward.  Of course it wore off, I was released 3 days later. Would I do it again? No. I was terrified to ever do anything pyschedelic ever again. But now, perhaps i realize it was a bad trip. Next time, I will plan it\ldots ..
