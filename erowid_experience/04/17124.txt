Alright, when I am running low on Oxycodone or any other Opiate that I may be lucky enough to have, I usually go straight to my herb stash in my room.  My Mom used to work at a Herb Shop so we have like crates of this stuff.  Anyhow I waited to until I had a great meal in me, because if my blood-sugar levels aren't up or at least normal when taking this many Central Nervous System Depressants it can suck pretty bad.  I mean, it's never life threatening, at least to my knowledge, the worst it gets for me is feeling all half-asleep and shakey, but that only happens without food.  And, it could be way different for anyone else because I am hypoglycemic. So After eating steak at around 6:30 I waited a half hour until my stomach settled and then I popped the 17 kava, the 2 valerian, the 2 hops, the 2 passion flower, the 2 catnip and drank the scullcap extract, all with iced coffe, because the acids in coffee I find help to break everything down a little quicker.



After this I went to my room and chopped up the last oxycodone that I had left, and mixed it with about a quarter of a pill that I had previously chopped.  A good trick that I enjoy is after chopping my pill up, wrap it in a rolling paper and swallow it like that.  This way when the paper gets wet it releases all of the powder instantly and I don't have to wait as long for my body to break it down. So I did just that and kept a good quarter of the powder to put into a good gram of dank, and rolled it, with some slow burners, of course. I set the fatty aside, as hard as it was, and popped a lecithen.  This aids my liver in the secretion of bile and also acts as an emulsifier itself, seperatly from the bile.  Now all I had to do was wait.



So about 25-30 minutes go by and as always I slowly start drifting into a light sedation comparable with the onset of any opiate-alkaloid, with the exception of everything looking soft or filtered like opiates tend to do. Instead of being `pixelated' it was the opposite, things were crisp looking, and my mind set was like nothing could go wrong, that is why I love opiates.  The kava helps too.  So do all of the other herbs but opiates never fail.  After about an hour passed, I was really starting to feel the whole combination, a feeling of complete and utter somnolence mixed with a remarkable euphoric floaty sensation.



Now the only bad thing about this combo is inbetween the peacefulness and bliss of my mindset, I will get a 30-60 second bad premonition, or what I can only describe as the feeling one would get before a tragedy or the death of someone. A feeling that something just isnt right, not just in my mindset but everywhere around me and everything that could happen or might happen will be not good.  This goes away within a half of a minute or so, at least for me, but I have had panic attacks before and know how to get through them. It usually happens when the kava starts to peak, about 2-4 hours depending on how much I take.



Well, back to the euphoria, so I watched the sunset and started feeling like I do when I am drifting off to sleep except I was not drowsy at all and trails followed off everything that reflected or protruded light, but comparable to LSD the trails were not sectioned or translucent, but more like liquid light.  At this time I decided to take some capsicum before I fired up the joint, I find taking capsicum before smoking increases my stone.  It could be because it speeds up your entire body, and dialates your blood vessels.  So I swallow the ml of capsicum and wash it down with water, then at a little past twilight sit out on my porch and fire up the fatty.



The oxycodone gives the dank a more floral taste, but I actually enjoy the flavor-plus it melts down into the plant like opium and makes the ganja burn longer.  So as I smoked it started to rain.  In colorado it doesn't rain very often, and I love the rain so that further heighted my mood.  What really trips me out on this stuff is that I always see figures and objects out of the corner of my eye, like white energy feilds or something, but I like getting freaked out at the same time, so that's alright.  So it's been about two hours or so since I first popped everything and after finishing that fatty everything turned intense, like a half cartoon half dream state that made me zone out.



I decided that because this part of the experience is so internal and because I was thinking of such twisted things, I would meditate and gather my chi. So I sat in my chill room and turned on all of the christmas lights that I have up to sit a calming atmosphere. I sat on the floor at first and closed my eyes and just let my mind do what it wanted.  At first I thought about earthly problems that were bothering me, but those slowly subsided and after that everything kind of `spread apart.'



The best I can do to describe this state is picture a single circle of oil floating in water-this represents my thoughts normally.  Now, if you disturb the surface, the oil splits into thousands of mini-circles, now picture all of the oil circles floating in every direction except towards each other; and the oil expands as far as the container holding it.  The disturbed surface represents meditating, the seperate spots of oil represent the way my thoughts were all seperate from one another, opposed to being one conglomerate persona.  The container represents how much of the substance I take to help induce the drifting or how deep I can go into your own mind.  It was indeed an enlightening experience, because I could see every point of view there was to see for any idea that passed through my mind.



After slowly desending back into my reality around me, I realized that I had been meditating for about an hour an twenty minutes, and it was close to 10:30.  I was still completley worry free for the rest of the night and started writing about this experence at about 12:30.  Now while writing this everthing appears to have it's own illuminating glow.  It makes me feel like I am on the moon.



I love this combo and the only thing that I wouldn't recomend is taking 17 kava, unless you are an experienced kava user.  I have done this about 5 or 6 times and each time it is a different experience than the last, but thats half the fun because the euphoria is always there.  Usually I'll just take kava and opiates together but this is when I just want to get laid-out.  I hopefully should be trying this along with some blue lotus that I will soon be ordering.  I'll tell you about it when that happens.
