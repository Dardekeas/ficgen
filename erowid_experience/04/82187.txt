Recently I had been reading a lot about the various RCs around and as I've always been curious about drugs. I started smoking pot at 12 then went through amphetamine, Ecstacy, benzodiazapines, crack cocaine, cocaine, methadone, LSD, mushrooms and ended up taking heroin and getting hooked for some years, so I've had experience with both uppers and downers. But as I'd kicked the heroin habit I decided to try these Rcs.



Firstly I tried Mephedrone, swallowing 250mg in a `bomb' before going to a house party. After 15min I could feel a slight restlessness which got stronger as time went on. By the 1hr mark I was defiantly feeling something. The closest I could compare it to was amphetamines but it wasn't anywhere near as aggressive. On speed I just HAD to move, even if sitting I had to jiggle my leg but with mephedrone it didn't seem to be like that at all although I was still strongly stimulated. I could sit and be still, no compulsion to move myself if I didn't want to, where on speed I felt I ``had'' to. I also had an overwhelming need to talk and be frank with people.



The other thing I noticed, I had a great empathy with people, not as strong as with MDMA, but personally I felt MDMA to be too overwhelming in its empathy giving qualitys. With mephedrone it seemed I had the right balance for me. After 3hrs I decided to top up as I seemed to have crashed all of a sudden with no warning, which was a shock as with other things used its always tapered off, so I swallowed another 250mg and this took me back to where I was before. As the night went on I found it very easy to talk to people I knew and didn't know at the party which is normally hard for me and as night turned to day (I swallowed my first bomb at 6pm, my second at 9pm) I decided to leave for home, which was around 5.30am. I felt sleep was impossible for me so I stayed awake, not feeling any come down but just generally drained, due to no sleep. Then next night I slept fine and wanted to repeat this experience. 



My next experience with mephedrone was drastically different and is maybe a cautionary tale about mixing drugs, at least mephedrone and cocaine. The amount was the same, 250mg swallowed around 6pm then out to friends house for a party. I smoked some pot and talked away feeling the same empathy and stimulation. This time though a friend brought out some grams of cocaine which some of us proceeded to take. Alltogether, over the night (from 7pm to 5am) I had gone through 2 grams myself pretty much, but the 2 drugs didn't mix well at all.



Where the last time I was clearheaded and knew what I wanted to say, this time I kept forgetting what I wanted to say, I was jabbering a lot and falling drastically behind in conversation. An example of this is how a friend and I were trying to remember the word penicillin as we were talking about allergies, but we couldn't think of the word. Some hrs later it popped into my head and I shouted ``penicillin!!'' even though the friend I was talking to about this earlier was long gone. Evidently the mix of both drugs had impaired my mind greatly so I don't think I'll do this again, as although it did feel good at the time, looking back though it was too much on my brain.



So in conclusion I think Mephedrone is a very good stimulant, it has all the good qualities of amphetamine, like stimulation, increased awareness and confidence but with the added bonus of a feeling of empathy and euphoria, which speed doesn't have.
