okay, so i'm supposed to be introducing my friend, cyclops, to 5meo-amt.  sounds good.  i gave him a 10mg cap the prior night, and he was supposed to come by around 9:00 PM and dose it w/ me.  well, i get impatient, due to a long come-up time, and go ahead and dose about 17-20mg (no scales, doin' it by eye).  i had a friend with me when i dosed, but she had to leave, unfortunately.  so i've eaten my dose, straight powder, no cap, and i NEVER puke on this stuff.  it's felt close, but never happened\ldots   until this night.  around T+2h, i darted into the bathroom and suffer from multiple violent upheavels of my gastric fluids.  not comfortable.  but, contrary to what I'D heard, it kicked me in somewhat.  now is when cyclops should've been coming over\ldots   RIGHT?  well, no, i suppose.  i find out, two days later, that he got stuck two towns over, and forgot about me.  i start trippin out pretty hard, and around T+3h i feel i peaked.  `this isn't so bad,' thinks me\ldots   `just boring as hell.' don't get me wrong the trip was great, but there was nothing to occupy my mind except all of my faults.  and i began to think about how `pathetic and loathsome i am' and how `i'm just fucking up my life doing this crap' and how `weak i must be that i'm finding my only solace in temporary insanity.'  needless to say, that's not too cool.  at aroun T+4h, i decided to leave my bedroom.  i live with my family, though, i'm in my lower twenties, but my family's alright.  i explained to my mom what was going on, and she was curious as to waht kind of buzz it was, but given that she mostly drinks and smokes green, i could only equait the trip to LSD, for that's the only kind she's ever had.  apparently she understood enough, though, for she sat and talked with me, to keep my mind busy, until she had to go too bed.  so i went back into my room.  i sit in a chair.  and continue sitting.  and continue sitting, then i remeber that i have a stereo.  i figure out how to work my stereo at about T+6h, and it is good.  i put in a cd of Aura-The Source of Trance (great stuff, MP3.com).  craziness abounds in EVERY sound.  up to this point, i'd never experienced audio psychadelics (alterations of sound), aside from LSD.  it was crazy.  then, about T+7h, it started storming outside.  this set off all kinds of what i feel to be TRUE audio hallucinations.  the only ones i've ever had ('cept maybe with dramamine and benadryl).  picture (hear?) this:  there's a toothpick with one end wedged between your two front teeth on the top and the other end wedged in the bottom two front teeth.  now, tie a string to it about three inches long, and attach a speaker to the end of it.  have the speaker play nothing but the engines from Super Mario Kart (SNES, not N64) and the send it spinning around the toothpick.  gokart and motorcycle engines spun in circles around like that, and i could feel the pressure in my skull change to accomadate every time they circled around into my head.  now, picture a painting of a mile-tall cylinder, made from half-decompsed human cadavars, then turn it into a line drawing, then, have ameoba-like critters move up it, but only on the ink\ldots   the patterns and trails they would make were the kind of thing i was seeing all over anything with a `complex' texture (i.e. my plaid couch, or my cordura pants).  but, still going strong, at T+9h, i saw the sun coming up, and i grew to be QUITE happy.  for all night, i'd been afraid to go outside due to the police (probation's a bitch).  a good thing, probably.  at sun up, i walked up and down my road for about an hour, then i came home, and my mother and father sent me to the store for cigarettes.  riding a bike was quite the intriguing experience.  looking down at the road.  the white rocks in the pavement began to shatter outward, and took on the appearence of the old Windoze screen-saver `starscape simulator.'  craziness.  i didn't ever come down, i just lay down upon the couch in my bedroom at around T+10h, and forgot where i was, and what was going on, over and over until i fell asleep, at what time, i have absolutely no clue.  while i had a crazy trip (the hardest i've ever had, aside from my first LSD), i will not EVER do that again alone.  it wasn't a `bad trip,' but it was a really shitty experience, all together.  i'd say twas about a ++++, though\ldots
