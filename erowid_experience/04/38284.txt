I complained to the doctor of severe back pain and tenseness that prevented me from getting adequate sleep, just to see what I might get.  I ended up with a prescription for cyclobenzaprine.



At the time that I ingested the cyclobenzaprine, I did indeed have a fair bit of muscular pain in my lower and mid-back.  The doctor and pharmacist both cautioned me against taking it during the day and certainly not before driving or operating heavy machinery, saying that it would cause extreme drowsiness/sedation, and they said to absolutely not drink alcohol while taking it (ha ha\ldots right).  The doc also told me that many people feel woozy the day after taking it and suggested I try it first on a weekend.  



I had a rather bad case of bronchitis and had just started on an antibiotic (cephalexin) that day.  I had three beers in the early evening just before I took the first dose of cyclobenzaprine, and continued sipping two more beers over the course of the evening.  I drink frequently, so I only had a slight beer buzz as my tolerance for alcohol is high.  I also smoke quite a lot, so I was probably having a cigarette every half-hour or so (yes, even with the bronchitis).



Knowing that I had to work the next morning, I started slowly, taking the 1/2 pill dose (5 mg) recommended by the doctor (just to see if it did anything for my back).  After about 15 minutes, I started to feel sleepy, but that subsided quickly.  My back felt exactly the same.  I took the other half and waited another half an hour.  Everything felt the same.  Didn't get tired.  About an hour later, I took an additional 10 mg.  It did nothing. Thought I'd smoke some pot, but decided against it since I had to work the next day and I didn't know how it might interact. A half hour later, I took another 10 mg, and still, it seemed to do nothing.  I still felt like I had a normal beer buzz, and my back still hurt.



I was a bit bored and annoyed by this point, so I decided to forget about it and go to bed early so I could get plenty of sleep.  Then came the only noticeable effect of the drug.  As soon as I got into the half-dream state before sleeping, I felt like I was in the fluffiest, most comfortable bed ever conceived.  Toward early morning, I half-awakened several times and each time, the bed felt incredibly good.  Like I had several layers of goose-down under and over me.  My bed is pretty damn comfortable anyway, but it felt really good, even the covers over me felt different, like I had a big fluffy cloud hugging me.  It was a very nice feeling and I hated to get out of bed.



So basically, I suppose it does what I asked for: Makes sleeping more comfy when my back hurts.  And not a damn thing more.  The next day, I didn't feel particularly `woozy'.  Just normal for someone with infected bronchial tubes.  Had a fine day.  The stuff isn't terribly toxic as far as I understand, so I may try a larger dosage all at once the next time and see if it does anything more profound.
