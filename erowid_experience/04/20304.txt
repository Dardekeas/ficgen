One night I was browsing online because I had nothing better to do and I came across a few reports of people getting a `mild buzz' off 5-HTP. Well seeing as I had 5-HTP and nothing better to do I decided to take a bunch. I popped 12 50mg capsules and within 45 mins I felt slightly out of it. About an hour and a half after taking them I felt considerably messed up and quickly got bored of this very pukey buzz. 



Normally I would have just smoked some pot to feel better but seeing as I didn't have any I decided to jus get realy friggin drunk and try to forget about it\ldots \ldots HUGE mistake. I'm a 16 year old kid I have absolutley no tolerance to alchohol, I can get pretty drunk off 5 beers. After beer number 4 I was completely gone, the buzz was a lot different then just drinking without the 5-HTP. After my 7th beer my nausea had completely vanished and I had become `zombified' for lack of a better word. For some reason I jus couldn't stop drinking. I remember throwing up at one point then I just started drinking again (I don't know what the hell I was thinking). Anyway I woke up in the hospital, my mom was there, she was pretty pissed at me. I havent had a beer since I never again wanna drink. This was by far the most horrible experience of my life.
