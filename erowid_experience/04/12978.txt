At this moment I am looking at my Harmine HCL crystals growing on a plate\ldots  I saw this extraction somewhere else on the net, and didn't know If anyone had tried it, but it works\ldots  The first time I tried it I didn't get the 4 mm long crystals that I was supposed to get, but the whole extraction process I went through just became a cluster fuck in my kitchen\ldots  I hadn't cleaned all my glass properly, and I didn't have what I needed at that time\ldots .        



Now I have seen harmine hcl for sale online and in can cost as much as \$100 a gram, and you can buy a pound of seeds for less than half that and do your own extraction\ldots . hmmmm



Anyway, here is the process I used to get the beautiful 1-4 mm long crystals growing on my plate\ldots  I don't even know who's process this is that I am stealing, but the one I use is for chem idiots like me, no math or any thing involved\ldots 



Step one:

Take your harmala seeds and boil `em ( you can add an acid or not.  I always add a little vinegar, never measure though).  When they have boiled for about 30 mins, strain the water with a tea strainer into a pyrex measuring cup/mixing bowl thing you can get from a grocery store.  Boil 'em again\ldots   strain into the same container.  Boil `em again\ldots   strain into the same container.  



Step two:

Dump the seeds and wash the pot you were using.  Boil some water and add rock salt (important to use rock salt because there is noting add to it, regular table salt fas stuff add to it.  If you have to use table salt, make sure it doesn't have Iodine in it).  Keep adding rock salt to your booiling water `till  No more disolves, so now you have a super saturated salt-water solution\ldots .



Step three:

Strain the hot salt water into you hamarla boilings to keep out the salt rocks, Only adding enough salt water so that you have 2 or 3 parts harmala-water and 1 part Salt-water.  I try to make sure that I have 3 times as much harmala solution as I have salt water.



Step four:

Stir it all up, then add a little bit of cold water to aid in the cooling of the mixture\ldots SOMETHING should precipitate out.  That's a good thing: the crystals form when the temp of the solution drops.  Put it in the freezer for an hour.  After that put it in the fridge for a few hours (longer if ya like, but three of four hours is what I did).



Step five:

There should be a whole bunch of crystals and grunge at the bottom of your container It doesn't matter how big the crystals are just yet\ldots . I could hardly notice that they were actually crystals, the just happened to be about 1 mm little needles.  Now it should be strained again\ldots I used a bandanna to strain, but a t-shirt will work\ldots  Put your filter cloth over the top of a big stock pot and slowly pour you crungy/crystal solution through it\ldots   Now you can dump the shit in the pot outand lay your t-shirt over the pot under a fan to dry out\ldots 



Step six:

It should look like you have extracted sparkling dirt from the seeds\ldots  Scrape all your sparkling dirt off your t-shirt and into a clear glass container and add just enough methyl alcohol (ethyl should work too though, and you will know when there's enough you'll have yellowish/reddish/orangish alchy with brown shit in the bottom).  The sparkles dissolve and the crunge doesn't\ldots  strain again through a t-shirt and into your a flat Pyrex baking dish or onto a clear plate.  Place under a fan or somewhere with adequate ventilation and wait and watch\ldots .  





Beautiful crystals



This is what Legal highs has to say about harmine



HARMINE -- 7-methoxy-1-methyl-9H-pyrido (3,4-b) indole.



   Material:  Indole-based alkaloid found in several places including 

\_Banisteriopsis caapi\_ (from which the South American hallucinogenic 

brew yage is prepared), \_Peganum harmala\_ (Syrian rue), \_Zygophyllum 

fabago\_ and \_Passiflora incarnata.\_



   Usage:  25-750 mg harmine (see effects) is ingested on an empty 

stomach.  In its hydrochloride form harmine may be snorted (20-200 

mg).  Injection dosges are smaller:  SC 40-70 mg, IV 10-30 mg.  

Absorbed poorly through stomach.  Small doses (20-200 mg) effective 

intrabuccally and sublingually.



   Effects:  Harmine and related alkaloids are serotonin antagonists, 

hallucinogen, CNS stimulants, and short-term MAO inhibitors (100 x MAO 

inhibition of improniazid but lasting only several hours).  Small 

doses (25-50 mg) act as mild and therapeutic cerebral stimulant, 

sometimes producing drowsy or dreamy state for 1-2 hours.  Larger 

doses up to 750 mg may have hallucinogenic effect, the intensity of 

which varies widely with the individual.  Doses of 25-250 mg taken 

with LSD or psiolcybin alter the quality of the experience of the 

latter.  Telepathic experiences have been reported with this 

combination.



   Contraindications:  Harmine is a brief MAO inhibitor.  It should 

not be used with alcohol and certain foods and drugs (see list).  When 

snuffed, harmine may be slightly irritating to nasal passages.  Large 

amounts may depress CNS.  Since individual sensitivity varies this may 

occur with 250-750 mg.



   Supplier:  CS.



   Note:  Notes on other harmala alkaloids:  Different harmala 

alkaloids vary in potency.  The equivalent of 10 mg harmine is 50 mg 

harmaline, 35 mg tetrahydraharman, 25 mg harmalol or harmol, 4 mg 

methoxyharmalan.  Harmal alkaloids are synergistic (mutually 

potentiating) and are therefore most effective when combined in an 

appropriate balance.  Tropines (belladonna alkaloids) also potentiate 

harmals.  Harmol and harmalol (phenols) in overdoses can cause 

progressive CNS paralysis.





I have snorted it\ldots . it gives good dreams\ldots .  makes my mind work in an interesting way (and faster)\ldots  Seemes to be an aphrodisiac for me (very interesting effects here).  It is numbing to the tongue; burns like hell when snorted; tastes like an alkaloid (very bitter); It also makes my spit and piss glow in unde Blacklight.  It doesn't cause me anywhere near the nausea that regular Harmala brews and extracts do, and I have not tried it as a MAOI for tryptamines.



I hope this will be somewhat helpful for others.
