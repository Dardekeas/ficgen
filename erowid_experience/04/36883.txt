I noticed that my roommate had a bottle of strattera, the non-stimulant ADD medication, sitting on his dresser. I was bored, and even though I knew it wasn't the same, I figured that since most attention-sharpening medications were fun, I'd give it a try.





I popped 4 40mg capsules at about 12:30pm, and didn't really feel anything until about 2:00pm.  The buzz wasn't intense, but was far beyond placebo. By around 3:00pm, it had become an odd feeling in my stomach, a heavy head, and sensitive eyes. I thought for sure that my pupils were dilated, but when I checked in a mirror, they looked normal. The stomach feeling was ok at first, but eventually was uncomfortable and just plain annoying. I had trouble keeping my eyes focused, and I started to get really tired.



I left and went over to a friend's room, when I started to crash.  I felt like I was walking in rapidly-drying wet cement on the way there. So, rather than hanging out, I asked if I could lie down in my friend's bed, and I did. I felt like absolute crap. My head was still swimming, but my body felt like I had been awake for days.



One interesting thing that did happen though was a tiny psychedelic effect. As I laid in bed, someone was below me watching tv.  I can never sleep with a tv on in any normal circumstances, because I can't help paying attention to the sound. By listening to what was playing on the television, I was making a mental picture of what was on, and every time the channel would change the `movie' in my mind would keep playing the same as it had, as if there had just been a change in the storyline. It was as one linear story, with many very odd plot turns. I would catch myself doing this, stop, but then it would happen again. I think it was because for the longest time I was stuck between sleeping and being awake.



Once I finally did get to sleep, I slept for about 3 hours. When I stood up my head felt very tired, with a little headache, and my body was still exhausted. I went to sleep again at about 1am, and still felt the after-affects all through the next day.



I will not be using atomoxetine again. The buzz is definately not worth the crash that it causes.



Stay Safe.
