Before I begin, let me preface this tale by saying that I can't be 100\% certain what actually happened over the 48 or so hours in which I was under the influence of these drugs.  I can only tell the story from my own skewed perspective.  While some of the facts near the end were verified by sober onlookers, the majority of this tale is subjective to my own internal experiences and dialogues. 



1st Dose:



I began the experience taking one `dose' of a mixture of 2C-I, 2C-E, and 2C-B, mixed into about a shot of vodka (It was pre-mixed when I purchased it).  I was told that one dose equalled about one shot of the mixture.  To this day, I'm not sure the exact amounts of each of the three drugs contained within this mixture.  I and 4 friends of mine each took a dose of the mixture late in the evening.  I had taken my dose on the way, so I began to feel the effects a bit before the rest of them.



The drugs took somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour to take hold (I think).  When they did, it was nearly instantaneous.  I was having a conversation with one of the friends I was going to be tripping with, when suddenly, I became aware that the words I was saying were meaningless. I began to talk about nothing. Literally nothing. I was saying things along the lines of `It doesn't matter what I talk about, as long as I keep talking, you'll continue to listen, and whether or not you understand what I'm talking about doesn't really matter.  I can continue to talk for as long as I want to, and you'll just sit there and listen, whether or not I have anything to talk about, I can just continue to speak about nothing, and you'll just sit there like you are right now,\ldots .etc.' While I was going on this tirade (which lasted a full 3-5 minutes), my friend neither said a word, nor moved a muscle.  I felt empowered, as though my very words, and the intent behind them, were what was rooting him to the chair.  



Within a few minutes, the rest of the crew began to feel the effects.  Some of the people in this group were of, *ahem* lesser intelligence.  The hallucinogens really got on top of them.  One ripped the streamers off of a wind ornament, tied them around his head, stuck his arms out in front of him, and began to run around the yard, as a child would, pretending he could fly.  Another spent his evening berating the first for his behavior, and arguing with people about trivialities, such as who's turn it was to buy cigarettes, accusing people of stealing things from him, and generally acting condescending toward the entire group.



Within an hour, the group was split into two distinct groups.  Those that were hallucinating visually, and those who were more verbally oriented.  I was the `leader' of the latter group.  The condescending fellow was the `leader' of the former.  One mutual friend of ours in particular tended to sway back and forth between the two.  Interestingly enough, he couldn't seem to speak intelligently and enjoy the visual hallucinations simultaneously.  Depending on who was `winning', he would oscillate back and forth between the two groups.  For a few hours, we entertained ourselves by exploring this phenomena, each attempting to win our friend to `our side'.  I eventually won by explaining to him that tripping was a way to see the world from a different point of view.  My argument ended with a single phrase, which caused all of us on `my side' (including myself) to burst into hysterical laughter,  uncontrollable due to the pure ecstatic feeling flowing through us.  The phrase (which to this day, seems to hold a deeper meaning than is apparent) was `You just caught on to the tail end of the loophole in reality.'



Just before sunrise, the individual who had taken to `flying' around the yard pulled out his MP3 player.  After a few minutes, he let me borrow it.  I turned it to `listen to your heart', one of my favorite techno songs, and was instantly overcome by a feeling of pure ecstacy.  By this time, we were all sitting in my vehicle, and I felt compelled to begin technoing.  Understand that I never techno.  Ever.  I climbed on the hood of my car, and began technoing/dancing/ whatever you want to call it, to the music that only I could hear.  I felt a sense of pure freedom.  Soon after this,  the peak of the first dose was beginning to wear off.  I went home just after sunrise, still feeling the effects of the drugs from the night before.  I spent most of the day relaxing, watching TV, and generally unwinding.  



That evening, (while still under the effects of the first dose) I went to an apartment where 2 of my friends lived.  I'd just met them about 6 months before, and had tripped with them on a combination of LSD and 2C-I about 3 weeks before.  I can't be sure what the actual conversation we had was about, as I was still tripping pretty hard, but the short version of what I heard was basically that reality as I know it doesn't exist.  I had an intense feeling that both of them were reading my mind.  It threw me off, and so most of the talking fell to them.  It seemed that every time I had a thought, before I could say it, one of the two of them would say what I was thinking.  For a solid 20 minutes, I just stared at the two of them, dumbfounded, unable to speak a word. 



2nd and 3rd dose:



At the time, I was infatuated with a girl I had met at a paramedic class I was attending.  Telepathically, they communicated to me that I should go and find her, and that reality would warp itself around me to fit my needs.  Excited yet nervous, I left their apartment feeling very insecure.  I convinced myself that what I needed was more of the drug concoction.  I raced home, grabbed what was left (about 2 doses), and downed it.  After about a 45 minute drive into town, I called her.  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#   She said she was at a street party, and that she thought I shouldn't come because the police had been patrolling the area pretty heavily.  Usually, this would deter me completely, but by this time, the drugs were beginning to take hold, and my confidence was bolstered quite a bit.  This is where everything started to go wrong.



At this point, I feel I should explain my physical condition.  I have a bone disease known as OI, brittle bone disease, or (the scientific name) osteo genesis imperfecta.  I've had about 50 broken bones in my life, and have to be careful on a daily basis to avoid being injured.  I arrived at the party feeling wonderful.  Within a few minutes, I heard her and two of her friends complaining about some party crashers who had showed up, already drunk, and were proceeding to ruin the party for everyone else.  Feeling invincible, I decided to intervene.  



I walked up to the nearest of the crashers, and asked if there was a problem.  He shoved me and told me to back off.  Again, feeling invincible, I responded in kind.  Before I knew what happened, he and two of his friends set upon me, attacking from the front and both sides.  I didn't have much of a chance against one of them, let alone three.  Within seconds it was over.  I ended up with a broken nose, a broken rib, a broken jaw, one of my teeth knocked out, and a large gash over my right eye.  Unfortunately, the only person I knew at the party was the girl I was there to see (who weighed about 90lbs, and could do little to help me).  After realizing how badly they had injured me, the obvious leader of the group apologized and then promptly left the party along with his `gang'.



Someone who lived nearby let me use their bathroom to clean up in, and I called one of my two previously mentioned friends to come bring me to the hospital.  When I got to the bathroom and saw myself in the mirror, I had what is to this day the strongest sensation of deja vu I've ever experienced.  It seemed at the time that the person looking back at me from the mirror belonged in a picture of a book I'd once read, but couldn't quite remember the title of.  I used their bathtub to clean the blood off myself (I was bleeding profusely from my headwound, and couldn't keep up with it using the sink. Luckily, my paramedic training kicked in, and I was able to significantly slow the bloodflow before my friend arrived to take me to the hospital). During this entire experience, I was awash with a feeling of total calm, as though somewhere deep down, I knew all of this was going to happen before I even arrived at the party.  From the time I stepped out of my car, it felt to me that I was simply an actor in a play, and that when it was all over, none of it would have happened to me, but to some character I was portraying.



I was perfectly calm and happy throughout the entire experience until after I had been admitted to the hospital.  When the doctor was stitching up the gash over my eye, I kept turning my head, trying to see what he was doing.  In retrospect, it's obvious I couldn't see my own face, but at the time, it seemed perfectly logical to try to see what he was doing.  He threatened to have one of the nearby paramedics forcibly hold me down if I didn't cooperate.  Only then did I even realize how much I was jerking my head around while he was trying to work.



After the doctor left,  the first and only visual hallucinations I had began.  The curtain surrounding my bed began to ripple as though it were an ocean.  As soon as I made that mental connection, I began to hear the sound of crashing waves and seagulls.  I also began to have a very existential conversation with my friend who had brought me to the hospital.  The version that I comprehended was that reality as I know it is made up of both the world of the sane, and the insane, and that it was both simultaneously.  As he `said' this,  I saw what looked to be an infinite number of tiny spaceships flying over every object I could see, trailing what I percieved to be some sort of thread, which `sewed' the two halves of reality together.  During our conversations, I eventually (and thankfully, only temporarily) became convinced that my friend was a physical manifestation of satan, and that this was all a part of his plan to steal my soul.  As I thought this, I began to see physical characteristics of myself begin to appear on him, and felt my soul, my consciousness, my very being, unraveling as he became me.  Just before the last tendril of my existence was yanked from me, I began to panic, to resist, and suddenly, I was myself again.  At this point, my mental state began to level out, and the rest of the evening I was entertained by various amusing visual hallucinations which I held no stock in.  Eventually I drifted off to sleep, and from there, my memory fails.  I remember nothing from that point to three days later when I awoke at home, sober, and in pain, regretting my decisions of the past week.  



This description pales in comparison to what I actually experienced, but this is as close as I know how to come to putting my perspective of the event into words.  For anyone out there who's interested in trying any of the 2C series, I'll say this:  Given the right dosage, environment, and people, it is a perfectly safe and fun recreational trip, but under the wrong circumstances,  they can be quite dangerous.  You may not even realize the danger your in until it is too late.  Always keep in mind that your are in an altered mental state, and that things may not always be as they seem when on these substances (as well as others).
