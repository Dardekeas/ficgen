I take 6mg of clonazepam daily, so the 15mg dose I took this morning was kid's stuff.  I decided to purchase a bottle of kava extract (40\% kavalactones, app. 2000mg kavalactones per bottle).  I tried 800mg kavalactones and, pleased with the mild anxiolytic, euphoric, and very strong muscle relaxant effects that were brought on after about 30 minutes, I decided to down the rest of the bottle.



T=0:10

Anxiolytic effects more pronounced; euphoria and muscle relaxation still moderately strong, but not changed since the 800mg kavalactone dose.



T=0:20

Feeling VERY sociable (a wonderful feeling for a social phobic such as myself); euphoria much stronger; muscle relaxation has practically turned my legs to jello.  No cognitive dulling of any sort.



T=0:30

Effects continuing from 10 minutes ago, though exponentially stronger.  I feel as if I could take on the world, if I could just make my muscles work properly, lol!



T=0:45

Just one thing to say--how can this stuff be legal???!!!!



T=1:00

Not much change from the 30 minute mark, aside from some pronounced OEV's, CEV's, and an almost LSD-like distortion in spacial perceptions.



T=5:00

The effects haven't subsided in the least in the past four hours, and I hope they never do!



$\sim$Anxiety level (1-10) -- 0; very disinhibited, in fact.

$\sim$Muscle relaxation (1-10) -- 10; and this is saying something, considering that not even Flexeril, Soma, Elavil, or Zanaflex have helped with my fibromyalgia.

$\sim$Pain relief (1-10) -- 10; I had a moderate headache before taking this, as well as the constant muscle-aches I deal with day to day.  All eradicated.

$\sim$Hypnotic effect (1-10) -- 1; I don't feel sleepy in the least. In fact, I feel mildly stimulated.

$\sim$Aphrodisiac effect (1-10) -- 10!!!  Jerking off was quite an experience, lol.



T=8:00

Still feeling the effects strongly, though the hallucinations have subsided just recently.  



T=12:00

Most effects subsided, except for moderate muscle relaxation, anxiolysis, and pain relief.



T=15:00

Back to baseline.
