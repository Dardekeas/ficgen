Let me start of by saying me and everyone involved are very experienced drug users. Verterans to say the least.  We have done many drugs such as mushrooms, pot, alcohol, coke, exstacy, and our very dear, long lost friend LSD, among others.  This night would prove to be unlike many others.



The other night me and some friends decided to chill at K's house.  We planned on it being just another friday night getting *ucked up.  Things went good for most of the night.



6:00pm:  We arrive at K's house, and go right upstairs to smoke.  During this time, we pulled out everything we would have for the night, minus the Buttershots and Baileys Irish Cream, which we planned on getting.  K had some cough medacine, but only he is crazy enough to drink that shit 24/7.  He began taking that.  Also, K made some absinthe extract out of wormwood. As N put the absinthe into doses and then into capsules, Kenny G pulled out the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds that he got today.  I have taken HBW seeds a few times and had good results, comparable to lsd.  Why not take some again?  Me, K, and Kenny G began scraping off the coating on the seeds so no one gets sick.  Kenny G's plan was to extract the seeds, but he had a lot so we decided to test them.



7:00:  It was a bitch, a real son of a bitch, but we finally got the seeds done.  We then crushed up the seeds in a pepper grinder and put them in capsules.  Me, Kenny G, and K each had 10 seeds.  We dropped them by 7:30, and began waiting for the effects.  I felt no nausea which I usually do.  I got real sick last time, then tripped harder than ever.  I was hoping for the same trip.  



8:30:  Me, Kenny G, K, N, Seano, and Young Bumble all chilled downstairs after smoking some bowls.  Me and Kenny G weren't tripping hard yet.  Everyone was pretty messed up, each on different substances or combinations.



9:00:  I get the call from The Man who says he will get us the liqs.  We pick him up and bring him to the store.  When he came out, he just shook his head because he had too much liqour, for us and him.  We then went back to K's.



9:30:  Starting to see some trails, pixles, and just a generally good feeling of an oncoming psychedelic.  I love it.  We go up to K's room where we sat down to smoke, drink, and watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force, one of the best showers ever.



11:30:  Me, K, and Kenny G are definitly tripping now.  I'm not tripping hard, but nice.  I could definitly feel the lsd like substance, and everything felt better due to the wormwood.  We hung around the basement.  B and M showed up for a while, then left.  After they left, me, K, Kenny G, and N decided to take another dose of 5 seeds.  K scraped all the seeds, and even after he spilled the bong water on them, we crushed them up, capped them, and swallowed.  Now we wait again.



12:30:  Kenny G and Bumble went outside to smoke a big ass weed stem.  I don't know why, but this kind of thing is normal for my friends. I joined them, as I am one of them.  Soon the others came outside, and we began to smoke a few bowls.



1:00:  Things were going good until now.  We stood outside smoking.  I was standing in front of the car, and began to feel something strange. It began in my stomach.  I figured the other 5 seeds were beginning to kick in.  All of the sudden, I began to trip harder than I have have in my life.   Everything got blurry and my head filled up with pressure.  I went to lean against the car, and to tell my friends something was wrong, but I coudnt talk.  Then I fell.



Before I knew it, things were coming back to me.  I was laying in the driveway looking straight ahead with my face on the ground.  I was trying to understand if I was alive or dead, as I left like I was in a graveyard, and I didn't have a clue.  I heard a voice say, are you ok?  I gave a thumbs up, as I could hear my friends, but needed to gather my senses.  My friends told me I fell to the ground and shook for about 5 seconds, as if I were having a seizure.  Seano said my eyes were rolling in my head.  Kenny G grabbed my arm and then slapped me, trying to see if I was ok, and thats when I came back.  I still didn't feel well so they got a chair and I sat down.



All of the sudden it started happening again.  I told them I needed to go inside.  As kenny G brough me in, my head filled with a pressure-like feeling, things got blurry, and all I could hear was a very loud ringing noise.  I thought my head was going to explode.  I sat down and knew I was about to be sick, so Kenny G got me a bag, and I got sick.  I threw up the rest of the seeds I'm pretty sure.  It was horrible, but after I got sick, I felt much better.  I relaxed, and everyone sat around, shocked.  No one really knew what or why it happened, but it did.  



3:30:  Bumble soon left, and after that we then went up to K's room where we layed down and eventually went to sleep.



Conclusion:  This night was one of the scariest, most fucked up nights of my life, and from what my friends said, it was scary for them too.  I'm not sure what or why this happened to me.  I have done many drugs, and I have never had any problems.  I'm not on any medications and I am generally in a good mood.  I have been only smoking and drinking for the last 2 months.  I didn't drink much tonight either.  I have a feeling that these seeds are very dangerous.  Everything was fine until I took more, then when they should have been kicking in, things got bad.



There are many debates on whether the seeds can be toxic, and I truely believe they are.  It's not going to happen to me.  Thats how I've always felt.  But after living through this night, I now know anything is possible.  It's happened to others, and now me.  I will never touch these seeds again.  Anything can happen at any given time.  Just keep in mind what happened to me.



Be safe everyone..Peace Out.  -MIRK
