I had recently received a 200 mg sample of 3-MeO-PCP through a reputable vendor, claiming high purity. This is my first time taking a dissociative (some experience with psychedelics, and more frequent stimulant and opiate use), so I decided to go for a pretty low dose that would give me an introduction to the effects. My evening went like this:

T-0:15: Ate a meal consisting of chicken strips since I was hungry and did not want to try eating while on the substance. Perhaps this affected the comeup time, or my body's absorption of the chemical.

T+0:00: Weighed out 6 mg on scale. Dumped it into a shot glass full of water; the powder dissolved easily. Drank the water, filled it up and drank it again twice to make sure everything was consumed. Went back to sitting on my bed on my laptop, surfing the internet, talking to people online, etc.

T+0:30: Stood up and tried walking around to see if I felt anything. Nothing at this point, and any slight different feeling I may have had I chalked up to placebo. Back to my computer it was.

T+1:00: My head felt a little bit heavy, and reminded me of the feeling as if I had taken a drink or two. Walking around, talking, etc. all felt normal and there was no noticeable difference in perception.

T+1:30: I'm definitely starting to feel it at this point. The feeling is pretty mild but there is definitely some sort of dissociation/intoxication. I continue reading random stuff on reddit.

T+1:40: The feeling is getting gradually stronger. My mood starts to get better. I put on my headphones and start listening to some music. Music sounds really good, which is typical for a lot of drugs. I can't resist the need to tap my foot to the beat or to bob my head, and since I'm alone I just decide to go along and `jam' to what I am listening to. I'm still talking to people online with no difficulty (perhaps 1 or 2 more typos than usual) and feeling not only in a good mood, but also content with myself. I smile.

T+1:50: I continue jamming to my music and start to feel more stimulated. I feel that, similarly to LSD, soon I will have to get up and start moving. I notice that my music player's `shuffle' option is doing a wonderful job at picking good tracks to play. =] I felt kinda `spacey' at some points, where I would just stare blankly listening to my music, feeling good. I guess this is what dissociation is.

T+2:00: I'm still really enjoying my music, but I decide to get up and start hanging out with 3 friends of mine that live across down the hallway in the same building as myself. The effects are at this point the strongest they will be, and I'm not having any difficulty. Admittedly I did fumble around a bit when walking, but in general I was able to function quite well and did not have any problem whatsoever walking and carrying conversation with others. My friends did not know I had ingested this compound, and I believe they did not suspect it. I personally think I was acting a bit silly, but I naturally do anyways so nothing was too out of the ordinary.

T+2:45: Decided to walk with 2 others back to the caf√© across the street, and get more food because I was hungry. I was still feeling slightly spaced out and couldn't decide what I wanted, so I got another order of chicken strips. While I was getting barbeque sauce for my chicken, I didn't notice my other 2 friends walk away, so when I turned around, I had no idea where they went. After 5 minutes of searching, I decided to head back home where my other friend was. The chicken tasted pretty good, and we talked more as the other 2 friends that disappeared had returned.

T+3:30: I return back to my place. I'm definitely not `feeling it' as much, but it's still there. I put my headphones back on and keep listening to my music and go back to talking to people online. I am unsure as to whether I am coming down or not since the entire experience has been pretty mild, but the music is still pretty enjoyable.

T+4:10: At this point, I can confidently say I am coming down. I'm still deeply into my music, but now I start to not feel as euphoric and stimulated, and more quiet. Nothing terrible feeling, but it reminded me of the feeling on days where I would take just a little bit more amphetamine than I needed and it finally wore off.

T+4:40: I go back to my friend's place down the hall to chill. I'm still slightly dissociated but it's a lot weaker than it was earlier this evening. Later, I tried doing some productive work but was lacking motivation (not related to the 3-MeO) and my mind didn't feel clear enough. So I just relax and talk to more people. And of course, play more music. Now for all intents and purposes, I'm pretty much back to baseline. Perhaps the last, slightly noticeable effects continue for another half hour or so.

Another while later, around T+6:15 or so, I took 5 mg melatonin and 50 mg doxylamine succinate. I honestly did not feel that the 3-MeO would prevent me from sleeping in any way and I probably would have been fine without it, but I take doxylamine roughly once a week anyways and I wanted to be sure. I stay up for a while longer, and am sound asleep by T+7:00.

Overall this was an enjoyable experience and exactly the kind of introduction to dissociatives I was looking for. Next time, I will increase my dose to 10 mg, which supposedly still retains the euphoria and stimulation without being too trippy nor dissociating. It's important to remember throughout this trip report that I consider 6 mg to be a pretty mild dose, so things like duration and effects are quite mild and slightly harder to compare to baseline.
