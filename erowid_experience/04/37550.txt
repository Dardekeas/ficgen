I'm male, 40 years old, 1.70 meter tall, regular MJ smoker for over 20 years, former heavy cigarettes smoker. In good health.



size of a bottle : 0.66 liter. alcohol content : around 5 \% vol (estimated).



I grew hops in my garden. Every autumn, I'm brewing beer from the female flowers. 

This year, I brewed a little amount of beer adding some fresh wormwood to the mix. I have reduced the amount of hops by half. I never weigh amounts. The volume of fresh wormwood was something like 1/2 of the hops, boiled for 1 hour. I tried drinking it last night for the first time, 5 weeks after having started the process. The beer was a bit more bitter than regular one, with a wormwood taste. I like bitter tastes very much, but it was the max I could drink with some pleasure. After having drunk 1/3 of the bottle, the wormwood taste seemed to be weaker. I drank the bottle in 3H approx. 

I had smoked a MJ joint when starting to drink. 



There was a specific effect which wasnt from alcohol, hops or pot. I was much more awake that I would have been with just the pot and a regular beer in the same time. I was more `high' than `stoned'. Visual perception was a little bit more `tridimensional', things had more relief, just like in a very mild Salvia trip. All this was light but I'm sure it wasn't placebo. 



The effect peaked when I had drunk 2/3 of the bottle, approx. 1 H 30 after the start. The high lasted for 1 H and wore off very quickly. 3 Hours after the start, I smoked MJ again. This time I was half asleep and very relaxed.  In the late evening, and today's morning, my intestines were a little bit irritated. It's the only side effect I had noticed. I got 5 more bottles of my wormwood beer\ldots  Next time, I'll try with a lower amount of wormwood in the brew. 



The taste is interesting, but once should be light-handed when adding wormwood in order to get something drinkable. I plan to try the `thujone extract experiment' and I'm wondering if the thujone which seems to be also present in Salvia officinalis could work too\ldots  I dont plan to distillate absinthe.
