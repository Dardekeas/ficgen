I'm a certified pharmacy technician in a hospital with rather shoddy inventory control, at least with unscheduled substances such as Soma. Occasionally I'll also come across a stray controlled substance -- in this case, 1 mg clonazepam.



I suffer from major depression and panic disorder, and take 40 mg Prozac a day, plus the occasional mg of Ativan as needed.



One fine evening, I felt like shit. Really, really depressed. I had to do something to cheer myself up before I just crawled into bed and cried all night. I figured this combination could only help. I'd used Soma in the past, but this was my first experience with Klonopin. After eating something to prevent stomach irritation I tend to get, I took two 350 mg tabs of Soma. As for the Klonopin, I started small, approximately 1/4th the tab, crushed and snorted over the course of several minutes. Not unpleasant. Shortly after, my nose felt very cold, almost as if I had snorted snow. Odd, but not painful or worrisome. I would guess it was local vasoconstriction, and thus would not recommend snorting this regularly. Any drip was virtually tasteless.



From my original, unexpurgated report at the time, approximately 45 minutes post ingestion:



`Dancing to Goldie. Feel great. Getting a nod of sorts.hard to stand up. whee. spinning on my chair is a lot of fun. Felt the urge to put on some makeup, so I did. basically random scribbles around my eyes.' 



Then my sister and her boyfriend came over to take me to a party I forgot about. Was a relatively boring party, but I had fun. I'd definitely call this a party drug combination. Not overly sedating, felt like dancing, everything silly. I probably wouldn't attempt to drive under the influence, but otherwise, I was normally coherent and cognisant. I felt very inspired, artistically, and probably would have ended up painting or drawing if not for the party. 

 

I wouldn't recommend this as a chronic treatment for depression, but it snapped me out of a near-suicidal mood. Similar to good marijuana, life was magical and interesting, the world my canvas to create upon.



I took another .25 mg of the Klonopin days later, when I went bowling with some people and had to be surrounded by rude, prissy teenagers and their horrid music. The Klonopin quickly erased any anxiety, and I felt more outgoing and cheerful. I'm a benzo fan for life and recommend them highly to anyone who needs them.
