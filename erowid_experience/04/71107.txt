I bought a one gram bag of what looked like tobacco at an adult book store and took it to a friend's house, where we had prepared by having a small water pipe and a butane lighter ready. I took a very small pinch out of the bag, loaded it into the bowl, and took my hit without hesitation. Little did I know what was about to happen, and it all began within seconds of letting out the smoke. My experience was spiritual and mind-blowing. I have spent the last eight months reviewing the experience and I still come away with new insights on a daily basis. My rendition of my experience is written as I experienced it, mostly in bits and snatches, which is why it is written more like thoughts rather than formal writing.



It began with a side view of a book, and I could see the pages being turned\ldots though it was more like they were fanned out\ldots perfectly spaced\ldots then, I pulled forward\ldots into the pages\ldots I had become part of the book\ldots integrated, fully\ldots .and that was when I noticed that the pages were made of flesh\ldots or it was like the book was one huge block of biomass\ldots and when my friend began to talk to me\ldots outside the vision\ldots he began to rise from the biomass\ldots but the pages never stopped turning\ldots and as each page turned\ldots it would tear a layer of flesh from each of us\ldots each page seemed thick, almost six inches deep\ldots I say `us' because there were so many living beings\ldots at differing depths within the the flat plane of the page surface\ldots and that we were all `one'\ldots 

 

and as each page turned and tore away at us\ldots it would leave me feeling raw, exposed\ldots vulnerable\ldots but without any real pain\ldots just fear\ldots at what I was seeing\ldots and the huge realization\ldots within moments of watching\ldots that the turning pages were eternal\ldots and would never stop\ldots and my feelings of fear, horror, wonder, awe, helplessness, being part of something so huge and overwhelming\ldots were magnified and expanded by the feelings of everyone\ldots because we were all connected\ldots 

 

My instinctual reaction was to fight it\ldots to try and escape\ldots then I began to sense that as each page turned\ldots that I was being freed\ldots even though it was in a way that exposed me and made me scared\ldots I was being released\ldots slowly\ldots with the turning of the pages\ldots and I reached out to my friend\ldots who I could see just out of my reach\ldots to offer him my hand\ldots thinking that I would help to release him\ldots and when our fingers touched\ldots the sensation rippled through the whole of us all\ldots .

 

Thank goodness my friend was there\ldots .I could hear his comforting words\ldots telling me that it was okay\ldots that I was just fine\ldots to just relax\ldots so I stopped thinking about the huge force that seemed to be pounding away at my being\ldots pushing me down, before pulling me up\ldots as the next page ripped part of me away\ldots and finally, I consciously released my illusion of control\ldots which, in turn, evaporated my fear\ldots 

 

So the pages kept turning\ldots and I turned to look behind me\ldots and realized that the book was as tall as the sky\ldots and I was miles away from the surface of the earth\ldots which disoriented me for a moment\ldots 

 

Then, I began to pull away\ldots like an out of body experience\ldots pulling back and upward\ldots so I could get an aerial view\ldots and I could see that the book was really a huge set of words\ldots .but only three words\ldots as tall as the sky\ldots and reaching into infinity\ldots the words were\ldots  `IT'S LIKE THIS'\ldots .which seemed nonsensical at the time\ldots but which I later understood completely\ldots my mind is so simple and straight-forward\ldots that it really couldn't have said anything else\ldots lol\ldots 

 

When I finally came out of it\ldots I was so freaked\ldots I instinctively grabbed for the bag of Salvia\ldots to keep my friends away from it\ldots protectiveness\ldots or something\ldots most probably because I needed to impress upon them the power of it before they ever considered touching it\ldots like I needed them to know what a huge thing they were about to touch on\ldots 



For about 20 minutes afterwards, I stumbled around the living room, trying to get my faculties back. I realized right away that Salvia shut down my physical being and took me to that place that could only be found inside my mind. Things seemed to go in and out of focus, so I made my way to the bathroom and splashed water in my face, which really seemed to help. I remained in an elevated state of awareness for roughly two hours after, which made the world seem clearer and more sharp in contrast. For days and weeks afterward, I regarded the world with new eyes, realizing all the things I had taken for granted. I did not find the use of Salvia to be pleasant at all, but I did find the experience to be enlightening. All in all, this experience was positive, but I don't wish or find the need to repeat it for a good, long time.
