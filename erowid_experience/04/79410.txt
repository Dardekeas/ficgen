So my experience with 2C-I was great! It didn't last as long as shrooms and it made me trip pleasantly. I took one scoop of my 100 mg (scoop was the tip of a new little cuticle pusher stick I had because I didn't want to take too much). I instantly felt warm but no tripping or `mdma' type feelings. I was asked to go to the mall and I figured if I was around people it'd be better because I know myself  when I eat shrooms or roll. 



Anyhow I snorted a little more because I just couldn't feel it and heard that it may be better that way. As soon as I did it burnt my nose a little and I got drainage but I've had worse with coke. As we were on our way to the mall I started getting an awesome body high and couldn't stop joking around with my friends who didn't know I was tripping. Almost an hour later I really started feeling the effects (This was TWO hours after I took it and only one hour after I snorted it). I saw how beautiful the colors in the store were and people started looking creepy like they normally do when I trip. I didn't realize it was so psychedelic! I thought it was a happy people drug (which it was) but I really felt like I was tripping my balls off! The colors in the store got too intense! Lol I'm shopping there as soon as I get paid because my memory was great on it and I remember every item I saw. Also a neat effect was the tracers I produced when we were driving back home, the sky looked like it kept having shooting stars and flickery type streaks. 



It lasted just long enough. It was gone by midnight and even though I started drinking beer to calm myself down a little so I would be calm by the morning, I had a great time with my friends who didn't know I was tripping. I think it's more fun to be around people that don't know your tripping when it's not so powerful that you freak out. 



I woke up this morning with a slight headache but I can't tell if it's the beer or the 2C-I. Either way I can't wait to go to the club with it!
