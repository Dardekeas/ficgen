Twelve 50-mg tablets of OTC dimenhydrinate HCl were taken orally with water, 6 hours after dinner (night). Onset of threshold effects was 30 minutes after ingestion. Setting was neutral. Personal narrative:



I felt slightly lightheaded but suffered no nausea. Visual effects: Slight undulation of floor and walls, transient motion signals, somewhat more vivid contours (perhaps due to pupil dilation). Auditory effects: I experienced minor auditory hallucinations that consisted of very short snippets, such as someone yelling my name, someone saying `excuse me,' the noise of midday traffic, hurried footsteps. These hallucinations would abruptly begin and end, and although I was startled by them, I never confused them with reality. There was no personalization or change in internal narrative mode.



So the psychological effects were rather unspectacular. However, the peripheral somatic effects were like torture. I was constantly twitching and twisting; seriously, when I looked in the mirror I thought that I looked like someone with Parkinson's disease. My pulse was very high ($\sim$160 bpm), and I could feel my heart beating strongly when I put my hand against my chest. When I attempted to inhibit this twitching, I suffered an aggressive buildup of tension in my chest and my pulse zoomed even faster, until I could no longer bear the discomfort; when I finally stopped trying to stay still, the built-up tension released in the form of a violent and painful flexing motion along the length of my body. Sleep was out of the question. I spent about 8 hours twiching like (very exhausting) until I came down from the trip at around breakfast the next day. 



I strongly discourage anyone from trying this drug at recreational doses.
