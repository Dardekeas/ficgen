I've tried vaporising 4-ACT-DET twice now. Once at 4mg and once at 16mg. With 4mg I thought I felt something but not much and it was so low a dose I figure it was too small. It has been a while since then. I finally decided to try it again with a bit more this time. 



When it first start to heat up there was decent puff of vapor but after this I let up on the flame to see what the immediate effects were\ldots . not much\ldots . when I tried to heat it again I got minimal vapor and after that a lot of it just seemed to char and remain in the pipe. So I would suggest if this is attempted to go all out on the first it because it does not put up with heat well and the longer it is the exposed the less you may get out of it.



Anyway within about 5 min some mild effects in tactile perception and mental perspective kick in these progress for some time but very very gently. At about 40 min there is a flushing of the skin, and a feeling of warmth so big doses might be dangers in a hyperthermic kind of way. Over all it is not an unpleasant experience but about only 1 half that of what 4-ACT-DET is like orally at the same dose. Visuals are about only 1/3rd what they are orally\ldots . 



Be safe and enjoy life. :)
