Short on time?  The last paragraph summarizes this report.  



Ever since I came across a couple legitimate online research chemical distributors, I have done my fair share of research.  Over the years, I've dabbled with 2C-E, 5-MeO-MIPT, 4-AcO-DIPT, Mitragynine, Phenibut, Piracetam, Ethcathinone, 4-mec, bk-MDMA, ethylphenidate , and 4-mmc.  There are reports here for most of these substances, but I have yet to stumble across one for ethylphenidate; hence this report.



Ethylphenidate is related to the ADD drug, Ritalin (methylphenidate).  I partied a few times with ritalin in my university years, always combining it with a night of drinking; all were memorable experiences.   I was, therefore, excited to read during my moderate research into the chemical that the liver produces ethylphenidate when attacked by ritalin and alcohol.  I have no idea how valid this information may be, but from experience, the effects of ethylphenidate differ from those of a night of ritalin and booze. 

      

As far as research chemicals go, the this one was fairly cheap.  It came through the mail in a paper-wrapped baggie in a bubble-wrap envelope.  The baggie mostly contained a white powder, but there were also a number white crystalline clumps, around the size of a pinhead, in the bag.  Under closer examination, the powder's particles appeared to be mostly thin an needle-like.  The larger clumps were quite fragile and could easily be crushed between one's fingers.    



I experimented by first snorting a pinhead's worth of powder to test for any allergies.  No problems presented themselves and I snorted around 10 mgs 30 minutes later.  There was no burn and effects began within 5 minutes.  I experienced a noticeable stimulation and a mild mood lift.  The lift in mood was quick to leave me so about 1 hour after my initial 10mg  I followed it up with another.  Mood lift was small, stimulation continued to build.  This process was repeated a few more times until I called it quits.  During this time, my appetite was suppressed.  Sleep came eventually, but it was more elusive than normal.  



My next experiment involved vaporization.  I smoked 3-7 mgs at a time on aluminum foil.  The smoke was unpleasant but tolerable. Smoking the material produced an effect similar to that of snorting it, but with a shorter onset and duration.  A mood lift, which faded after 10 minutes, was felt within 30 seconds of exhalation.   Stimulation was marked and seemed to fade within the hour.  I followed up by smoking several more times (no more than 10 mgs at a time) until I decided to call it quits.  



I quickly took to smoking the substance rather than snorting it.  The powder, when smoked, leaves behind an unhealthy looking black bubbly, burnt-sugar-like, solid.  The crystalline clumps seem to burn more cleanly.  When heated, these clumps turn rapidly into a liquid which vaporizes almost completely to leave behind a black speck on the tinfoil.



Over the weeks, the pleasant qualities of the drug have diminished and some disconcerting ones have surfaced.  I find that It is hard not to redose after having first taken the drug; I don't think that I ave ever taken it just once on any given day.  I rapidly developed a short-term tolerance.  By the 4th or 5th redose of the night, pleasurable effects were basically reduced to nothing.  Physical stimulation builds, but the mood lift and mental stimulation fades off.  Extended binges can make my heart pound strongly and bring my resting hear rate up to 120 bmp.  The drug also caused marked vasoconstriction.  It can clear a stuffy nose in no time, but erections become impossible.  I suspect this drug has serious cardiovascular side effects. 



All in all, this is a novel drug with fairly strong addictive qualities.  Its initial effects come on quickly, are pleasant,  and quickly fade.  Primary effects fade within an hour and leave me physically stimulated and wanting more.  Pleasurable effects diminish with successive dosing.  Extended binges can cause dangerously rapid heartbeat and strong vasoconstriction.  Individual doses were on the order of 10 mgs.
