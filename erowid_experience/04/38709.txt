Having read Shulgin's THiKAL notes on 4HO-DiPT and 5-Meo-DiPT potential interactions, I was curious to try it. I'm a male in my mid-20s and I've had experience with many types of psychedelics and was looking forward to reaching ++++. I had hit a crossroads in my life and was seeking guidance from within. Specifically from the Seventh, Crown Chakra. I had a friend, whom I've known for over ten years, who also has experience with psychedelics act as my `life line to reality'



10mg of 4HO-DiPT was mixed with 10mg of 5-Meo-DiPT into a gel cap. 



Note: the following times are approximate, +/-10 minutes or so.



T+0:00 - down the hatch w/ a glass of Cranberry juice. I had not ingested any food or drink (except water) for 8 hours. 



T+0:50 - starting feel space becoming distorted. (seemed to take longer to feel the effects), No real feeling of nausea, I am lying on the couch, listening to some very good techno.

 

T+1:30 - starting to feel time becoming distorted and slower, becoming difficult to move around as my perception is seriously distorted (when I move).



T+1:45 - my sensory perception is magnified by several hundred times: I am able to `see' dust floating around in the air; I attribute it to the fact that at this point time is really slow. What seems to be 1 minute of `real time' feels like 5 minutes to me. I read a book a few years ago entitled `The User Illusion' by Tor Nrretranders, which basically said that the human brain receives lots of sensory input (specifically visually) and discards a lot of the information (since our brain is locked into a `narrow bandwidth' mode). This drug combination seems to unlock that bandwidth problem, allowing me to see things that are physically there but are discarded by my brain. Also given that it seems to slow down the perception of time, I am able to process that information without becoming overwhelmed. 



T+2:00 - nearly peaking, difficulty seeing anything resembling reality - OEVs are intense. I look at my clock and the second hand seems to move very very slowly. 1 second = 10 seconds in my mind. At this point with my last grasp on reality, I down 10mg of Diazepam with a swig of water.



T+2:10 - I am completely disconnected from reality (++++ on Shulgin's scale), the OEVs are truly amazing and mesmerizing and I find it difficult to close my eyes. At this point I have lost all sense of depth perception and my 3D reality has disappeared. At this point I am seeing what looks like to me to be a Tesseract (4-Dimensional cube, which is spiraling in a never-ending tail, which seems to expand to fill my entire vision, or collapse into nothing ness). I seem to be able to subconsciously control this behavior for a while\ldots  After a time, though, I start to hear a voice\ldots  my own, which is explaining to me the secret to existence and the purpose of being. It told me that everything is one, and one is everything (huh?) At this point, for whatever reason, I realize that I might be dead, though that feeling lasted only briefly. The feeling passes and is replaced with complete happiness and suddenly I am following the expanding and contracting patterns\ldots  the color shifts dramatically and almost becomes a bright light at one point (I surely must be dead! I thought)\ldots  but the Tesseract is ever present, almost acting as my guide. Now I am riding a wave of euphoria and pleasure which made me orgasm continuously for sometime. It was almost like I was riding a wave of pure energy. The entire peak lasted approximately an hour and a half. Though, during the peak experience all human notions of time disappeared completely. 



T+3:45 - reality slow creeps back in, and I am able to hear and see my friend, and I am able to sit upright. I am able to talk to her but there is still a slight time distortion and it is unnerving when I hear my own voice being distorted. 



T+5:40 - Major trippiness is almost gone and voice distortion and time distortion are gone as well, though there is slight space distortion still. I'm hungry as hell from not eaten for almost 14 hours. I walk across the street to the 7-11 to get some food\ldots  



T+6:30 - Everything is back to normal, and I'm ready for bed. 



I couldn't sleep for another two hours though, as I just couldn't stop thinking about the experience and what I saw\ldots  



The next day I woke up after sleeping for only 6 hours, but I felt so refreshed and energized. I awoke with a new sense of clarity, and with a genuine sense of good will towards other people. More than that, with a feeling that I have to seize every day and really live and be in touch with Mother Earth (Gaia).



One thing that was odd about this trip was that the music seemed to be constant and never got distorted. Though, if my perception of time did become distored, one would think that the music would become distored as well\ldots  I can't explain it at all.
