 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\#  



It started out with a chemist friend of mine giving me 100mL of chloroform which I though I may as well take - hey, free high right? - or at least for a while. At first I thought that I wouldn't do very much, sniffing solvents being a pretty low form of high and a generally unpleasent smell, but that changed after a few deep huffs.



The smell was kind of sweet and became enjoyable as the night pressed on. The buzz was actually quite enjoyable and debillitating - not quite touching on N2O, but getting there. So from there I decided to make a bit of a night of it, seeing that I was staying home anyway. I must have been off and on sniffing the stuff for a good 3 hours (not constantly, but every 5-15mins I'd have a little binge of engulfing fuzzyness) and later on proved good at getting me to sleep, something I usually have trouble with.



I woke up the next day with the most horrible type of poisoning feeling like with food poisoning, but worse, so bad that I felt like death, or wanting to die. It felt like I had done myself some serious harm, especially in my head. I kept on heaving and could have told anyone to go fuck themselves. Moving around hurt and made me sicker. This went on for another 2 and a half days upon which I throw away the bottle. I haven't touched another inhalent since.



If anyone out there is considering sniffing chloroform, or any other solvent for that matter then keep this one phrase in mind.

`Bluuuuuyyrrrrr! OH GOD! Oh my, bluuuuuuyyyrrrrrrrrr! Ahhhh, never again, never ever eve.., bluuuuuuuyyyrrrr!' and so on and so forth.
