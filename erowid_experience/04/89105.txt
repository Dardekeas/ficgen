First, a little background information. I'm the `typical' drug user, using few things ocassionally but generally willing to give anything a go. I had taken diphenhydramine twice before, but had never had any real experience with it: the first time I took it, the dosage was too low to get any profound effects, the second time, the dosage was so high that I have no memories of the night. When I took it this night, it was on complete impulse, I had 400mg of diphenhydramine around, and was feeling pretty upset, so I took it. I was sitting at my laptop at the time, talking to a few friends via facebook.



My immediate reaction was fear. As it was an impulse decision, the main things going through my mind were `oh god, what have I done'. I was already feeling pretty upset and the feeling worsened as I began to cry.



Then, very very suddenly, I stopped crying and all feelings of fear and sadness just went away, and I began to feel light-headed, and a little drowsy. I knew it was probably kicking in. My mouth became \emph{very} dry so I went up to get a glass of water from the bathroom and as I looked in the bathroom mirror, a straight `laser' of light flashed across it, making me jump slightly. I went back to the laptop after filling my glass with water.



I put my iPod on, carried on talking to my friends, and thought nothing of it. I was becoming more detatched and light headed and flashes were starting to appear out of the corner of my eye that would disappear when I looked their way. I hallucinated a large and vividly orange blanket on the floor that would appear and disappear randomly. 



Over the music of my iPod, I heard someone calling my name, so I turned it off. Meanwhile, it was becoming harder and harder to converse over facebook, as I just couldn't comprehend the sentence structure. It's like I was reading it a word at a time and completely forgot the word before it, so understanding and replying to messages (I forgot what I was going to say) was incredibly difficult. I started to hear music from my iPod and checked several times that it was turned off. It was.



I had school the next morning and as I didn't really want to be high I decided it would be much better to try to sleep through it and talking was becoming way too difficult to stay on the laptop anyway. I turned the laptop off and got up to go to bed, bringing the glass of water with me, and the whole room began to spin and vibrate, and I noticed my feet were very heavy, like they were sinking into the floor, and everything was going very slowly, very surreal. I still had a very dry mouth but all drowsyness had gone.



I paced for a while and decided finally lay in bed. When I looked at my door, it began to twist and turn and seemed to be `jumping' away from me. I was still hearing snatches of music but now I could hear two people talking very clearly in a foreign language. If this had happened in my `everyday' life, I probably would have been very frightened but for some reason it just didn't bother me, I was that detatched.



I started to go into an odd kind of state, not dreaming, my eyes were open and I know the difference. But it was like I wasn't in my room, I had full control over myself and `forgot' it was out of the ordinary. I remember walking along a cobbled path talking to a friend. Each time these would end, I'd feel very confused and disorientated. 



As my mouth was still dry, I had to keep reaching for my water, spilling it several times because everything was still slowed down. By this point I'd forgotten I was high and kept seeing clothes on my floor (I'm a neat freak, this never happens), and I kept trying to pick them up, but they'd disappear as soon as I tried to do so, I became pretty annoyed by this. I eventually decided to go to sleep.



I can't say the experience was a particularly good one, but nor was it bad. It didn't scare me or leave any negative impact but it wasn't recreational or fun either. The next morning was odd, I was still light headed, very dry mouthed, and things still felt very surreal. I remember how vivid the `dream states' were (like walking along that cobbled path) and I was pretty freaked out that my everyday life was just a `dream state' and I was still high. All of these feelings and after effects subsided by lunchtime.
