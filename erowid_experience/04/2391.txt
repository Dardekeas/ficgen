11:30PM

-------

        I've been fasting since early yesterday evening ($\sim$30 hours). I

have here one Mitsubishi pill (MDMA), 10mg of 2C-B (as 5mg pills), and 4mg

(1/2 pill) of 2C-T-2. The plan is to take the MDMA first (as 2 halves, 15

minutes apart), then the 2C-T-2 when that begins to decline, then wait 20

minutes or so for potential nausea, then eat the 2C-B. This promises to be

a good night! I've never had 2C-B before, so I'm trying to go for the

Shulgin classic combination from PiHKAL. The 2C-T-2 is only to make up for

the low dose of 2C-B, and hopefully will not too much color the 

experience.

        Well, half the MDMA is down the hatch!



11:45PM

-------

        Other half down! I think I'm already feeling the first half of the

pill! Must be the fasting\ldots  fasting can make a massive difference. Alot

of butterflies in my stomach. Bees. Wow. I've been wanting to do 2C-B for

years, since reading the old Reed College `bromomescaline' thing. Nexus.

The elusive Erox. I hope this is as good as I've heard!



12:10AM

-------

        Damn, the MDMA is really beginning to kick in. Only 40 minutes in!

Fasting definately makes a difference. Its been a while since I've fasted

over 24 hours.



12:30AM

-------

        Wow\ldots  I'm going pretty good! I'm getting alot more than I have

off these Mitsubishis before! I think I need to begin fasting before trips

again. Not only does it make the onset faster and the effects stronger,

but you feel alot `cleaner' with an empty system. I wholeheartedly endorse

a nice fast of 24 hours (or more) before most entheogens.



1:00AM

------

        Down the hatch with the 2C-T-2!



        I'm in a great place. I read some email a friend sent me today

which I found very touching. I spent some time thinking about that friend,

and realized she truly is one of the treasures of my life.



        Spent some time laying down, just thinking. I love to do

MDMA-class drugs alone or with a small group of friends. Doing it at raves

or clubs is a waste. Too hectic for some of the sublter, delicious

effects. Doing it alone is especially luxurious\ldots  you can melt into a

wave of pure feeling. Lay down in a nice quiet dark room\ldots  maybe some

mellow quiet music\ldots  nice!



1:23AM

------

        I think the 2C-T-2 is coloring the MDMA some, hard to tell.

Anyway, I just ate about one and half of one of the bees\ldots  I cut off

about half of one and crushed it, to snort. Might as well, considering the

small ammount I have. The stuff I powdered, I put into 4 *very* small

lines.



1:40AM

------

        Schnorrrt! First bump, not too bad\ldots  Second, not too bad there

either. Two more\ldots  Third, in the other nostril - little sting. Nothing a

squirt of saline nasal spray doesnt fix\ldots  All done! Not bad at all.

Little bit of a bad taste, thats it. I assume the filler material in the

pill probably buffered it alot.



1:50AM

------

        Definately feeling alot more than MDMA now! Im feeling sweaty.

Sorta mescaliney, but the body sensations are still all MDMA. But wow,

they're increasing.



1:53AM

------

        Whoops, just went from sweaty hot to cold. Here come the bees!



2:05AM

------

        Wow. Very nice. I feel very cool, almost cold, despite still

sweating a little from the MDMA. I feel very good, physically. It feels

somewhat like a low dose of mescaline, or the latter part of my 2C-T-2

experience. Not outstandingly visual (yet?) but feels great physically and

mentally. Only drawback - it seems to enhance the MDMA jaw clench quite a

bit. Small price.



3:35AM

------

        Im in a really interesting space. VERY nice. Much like mescaline,

indeed! Similar to my San Pedro experiences, but milder on the body. I can

feel the 2C-T-2 in there, and the MDMA\ldots  but theybe all melded into a

nice whole. Colors stand out in razor sharp clarity. Very vivid, yet

natural. Mescaline-type visuals overall.



3:45AM

------

        Wow\ldots  this has only been 10 minutes? I must be experiencing some

pretty heavy time distorions. Laying down in bed with my eyes closed I had

some great closed eye visuals. I see things flitting around the corners of

my vision with open eyes. Colors are ultra-crisp. I see little fractally

overlays over alot of things. Shimmery and spider-weblike. Similar to what

I've gotten from mescaline. Sounds of crickets outside are amplified and

reverbate - natural music. Physical sensations are amazing. Not quite like

mescaline or MDMA but about half way in between the two polarities. I can

feel the MDMAishness fading some, but the 2C-B and definately the 2-C-T-2

are going strong still! In some ways theres a GHB-ish feel to the physical

aspect. This is very interesting\ldots  and nice.





5:10AM

------

        I'm still pretty stimulated, and my visual field is still pretty

crisp, but I'm on my way down now. Out with a little pot and GHB, then

sleep, I think!



Conclusion

----------

        Well, it took me till near 10AM to get to sleep. Perhaps the

2C-T-2 was responsible for that. There was a long lingering effect, with

good visuals lasting the whole time. Phenethylamines are unlike

tryptamines that way\ldots  the effects are more spread out and continuous,

rather than the sharp peak, gradual decline, and long tail of tryptamines.

It was definately a nice experience, and I hope someday to get to explore

2C-B at a more appropriate dosage range.
