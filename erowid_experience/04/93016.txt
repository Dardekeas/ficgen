I typically feel I can fill a novel about every time I try a new substance, but with 500 mcg 25C-NBOMe there's really not much to say.



It came on a BIG quarter inch cardboard blotter, and taking it sublingually made my tongue tingle quite a bit. On the top of the tongue it was incredibly bitter. Even after swallowing it this tongue numbness stayed around for a good five or ten minutes.



It took about an hour for any effects to start manifesting. This came in the form of an unremarkable brightening of colors and a slight distractibility. Around an hour later the visuals began to peak, and they were very faint multi-colored fractal shapes that were somewhat like a burned afterimage from looking at a light too long. I felt a distinct enhancement in the ability to evaluate things from different perspectives, not unlike a lot of 2Cs. I was baseline by T+7:00. No more than a +2 throughout.



My tripping partner described this as a starting point, or `launchpad' in his words. To me it was like taking a detour into LSD-land and briefly looking at it through the car window before you turn around and leave it. Perhaps at a higher dose this would have been more fulfilling, but I didn't feel the need to investigate any further. The feeling was nice, but not something worth intensifying in my view.



At the very least, this chemical interested me as something that might show up on blotters being sold as LSD. I wouldn't be pleased in the slightest if that ever happened.
