Let me start off by explaining my backround. I am a 17 year old senior in high school and an average kid. I drink about every 3 months, smoke weed about 3 times a week, and occasionally shroom. I have never had an adverse reaction to any of these drugs, though I seem to have a weak stomache when it comes to liquor (throwing up and whatnot).



It was New Years night and me and a few friends were waiting for a delivery of shrooms at `M's' house. We were waiting for about an hour when the news came in that obtaining our mushies would be highly unlikely, and almost immediately after I got a call from another friend that there was a huge party only a few blocks away. I said my goodbye to my shrooming pals and drove those 2 blocks to the party. When I got inside it was pretty empty but I was surprised to see 3 of my good pals just hangin out. I was contemplating getting drunk for about an hour when people just started showing up. Eventually there were about 40 people in the house, and that's when I grabbed a bottle of vodka and just started chugging it down.



I was really low quality and tasted like rubbing alcohol, but I didn't care cause I really wanted to get smashed. After about half an hour I was feeling really good, perfectly drunk and no nausea or discomfort. I was chatting like crazy and laughing with everyone and overall having an absolute blast. My friend `J' then came up to me and asked if I wanted to smoke a bowl, and, of course, I said yes. We walked out to his car and packed a bowl of some pretty high quality chronic. After smoking we walked back into the party and thats when things went wrong. I have smoked and drank before without any reactions, I would usually just have a good time and wake up with a hangover.



When we got back into the party I started to feel really REALLY messed up, about as intoxicated as I have ever felt. The room was shaking, I couldnt hold my balance, and everything was sooo loud. I kept saying, `I'm so fucked up, Im so fucked up' but it sounded like `Ilm shlo fa-uked ap, Iam shoooo faaaacked oop' I was sitting on a couch just feeling horrible when I felt it in my stomache. I ran to the bathroom and puked into the toilet about twice, then headed downstairs to lay in the guest bed. My friend `E' gave me some water and kept asking if I was okay, I told her I was fine and just wanted to rest, so she left me alone.



I woke up about 2 hours later and the party was completely dead, everyone was asleep. Then I felt it in my stomache again so I ran to the bathroom and threw up about 3 times. I went back downstairs and then ran back upstairs and threw up some more. The room was still shaking and my legs felt weak, I also couldn't think straight. I would throw up every 5 min and nothing was coming out, just dry heaves. My mouth got dry from dehydration and I couldnt drink water because I would just throw it up. The vomit was sticking to the inside of my dry mouth and it tasted acidic. I spent the last 4 hours of the night resting next to the toilet and just puking my brains out. I woke up around 9 in the bathroom. I got up and talked to my friends telling them how sick I was, my fingers were blue and my face looked pale. I knew I had to get home and by a miracle I managed to drive across town to my house. I pulled over the car once and threw up on the street.

At home I told my mom I caught the stomache flu and went to lay down. She got me a hot water bottle for my stomache and I continued to throw up every 5 min for about an hour. The next day I felt okay, just weak and tired. I stayed in bed until I felt better, ate some food and gradually recovered. It lasted for about 2 days.
