Wanting to experiment with drugs, but facing drug tests while switching jobs and not really having any contacts for extralegal substances, I've dabbled in `legal highs' recently.



Sativah is a herbal high combination of:  `Lettuce Opium, mad-dog weed, egyptian mugwort, passionflower, Salvia Divinorum, Hops, Strobiles, Mixed Chamomile, Damiana, Raspberry and Spearmint' The stuff I got was crudely ground, so I could actually see parts of the stuff they mentioned and I believe the list, including Salvia (by taste in smoke), which I've tried elsewise.



I bought a 28 gram pack from my local `headshop'.  The owner, an old hippie I'd known since I was a toddler, actually tried to get me to try this stuff first when I was looking for Salvia.  The info on the pack recommended trying just before bedtime.



I settled into my chair watching a movie, and I'd made all the preperations for bedtime.  About 1/2 hour before I planned to go to bed, I lit some in my home-made bong, which is a glass lemonade jar with some heavy duty plumbing tubing and a brass hose head for a cup.  I use small sheets of aluminum foil which I've perforated with a pin for a screen.  The overall volume is about 3/4 of the volume of a standard tobacco pipe.



The smoke itself was bitter and very, very thick with a grey/white coloring.  I sucked until it reached my lips, then exhaled while I covered the smoke chamber.  Then I let go of the control hole and sucked a lungful, held for 20-30 seconds, and exhaled.  From the jar, I was able to get 2.5 lungfuls and the cup lasted for two of these operations.  Since it was smaller than a standard pipe, I filled it twice.  Then I went off to bed.



On the way to bed I noticed some clumsiness, but I was tired already so I won't attribute that entirely to the drug.  What I did notice was an enhanced feeling of body.  I could feel and hear my blood flowing in my chest, through my heart and around my torso.  My heart was beating loudly, though not unusually fast, just that I could hear all the things inside my body.  There was other noise in the room, from my TV.



For a while, I played `Fire and Ice'.  Then, the noise in my chest subsided and I turned off the tv and went to go to sleep.  No images flashed into my brain, so I tried to create some.  Since I love Sword \& Sorcery stuff, I played out cliche scenarios; riding dragons, killing sub-men with a battle axe and chasing pretty scantily clad ladies through jungles.  Frazetta stuff;-)



Now, I have a good imagination already, but I did see an improvement here:  In the EASE of the imagination.  These felt close to real, even though I was using 1/10 the brainpower I did when doing this to `serious daydream' for a story.  I could FEEL the battle axe in my hand as I hacked into the head of a sub-man, Feel the wind and inertia riding on top of a dragon and the backlash of hot gas as I had it burn stuff on the ground and FEEL my manhood in the ladies I caught.  This was not a hallucination, because I knew what was real, it was enhanced imagination.  My body lie still through this.



When I finally got to sleep, I slept a little lighter than most time, waking up more often.  I did dream more in ways that I could remember, mostly lucid dreams between sleep and wakefulness.  These dreams were of going through endless mazes, some stone and underground, others made of semi-transparent glass in vast open spaces, like an endless beach under a few inches of water and a large open sky.  None of the `heroic fantasy' stuff carried over into these dreams, they seemed to be about a feeling of calmness and exploration and an unreachable contemplation.



I felt a bit tired in the morning, but there were other factors I could attribute to that.  Glad the next day was a day off, but I could have gone to work OK.  I definitely plan to try more, probably only one small bowl next time.  There's enough for a LOT of doses in one pack, so I hope this stuff `grows' on me.
