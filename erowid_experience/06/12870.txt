Setting: Private party of 25 or so close friends. Very casual. Activities included watching movies, lounging around and talking. 



6:45 PM - Insufflated 10 mg of 4-methylaminorex. This was only my second time with aminorex and the other time was oral, so i was extremely cautious with the dose. Other people were doing 20 or so, and were totally fine. I would rather underdose than have an even slightly difficult experience in a social setting, so I took 10. The powder had a very light pinkish hue (pretty). I insufflated deeply, so ended up with a bad stinging in my nasal passage and post-nasal drip. Chased with a snort of water. Since the dose was so small, I did it in one nostril, but next time I'd rather do both. Spread the discomfort evenly\ldots 



T+0:15 - Notice a feeling of cold in my extremities, and release of tension in the muscles of my back.



T+0:45 - Internal suffusion of warmth. Post nasal drip finally gone. My mood has lightened. This afternoon -- I think because if hormonal fluctuations due to my cycle -- I was feeling alienated and very grumpy. My mood is lightening, I feel more relaxed and connected.



T+2:00 - Feeling of `I took too little.' Don't want to boost with the aminorex because it's such a long experience anyway. Feeling gernally good, relaxed, connected -- this is definitely empathogenic right now. Thinking of taking some 2C-I.



T3:00 - I take 4 mg 2C-I (scale margin of error is +-2 mg), orally, get it on my tongue first so some may have crossed the mucosa. Taste is sharply `chemically' as opposed to `bitter'. Chase with gulps of water. Small dose chosen because of social setting, material that is new to me, and because I was told 2-CI doses are slightly smaller than 2-CB doses. This is a party where I would have taken 5-10 mg of 2-CB.



T5:15 - Wrote in my trip log, `Yes, it's here.' Colors a bit brighter, I'm getting punchier, got a much needed backrub. Feel in my body like the muscle sensation of MDMA. Uniform feeling of slight, pleasant tingliness. Go to walk around for a little, feeling a little restless, munch on some chips, find a sucker, flop down on a couch for a bit. I'm jawing a little, feeling tiny MDMA-like rushes. Don't remember having felt rushes on 2C-B.



T6:00 - This feels more rooted, with more gravity (physical, not mental) than 2-CB -- `more grounded', `taller'. Just want to stay in serene sitting yoga position or lying down, still. Enjoying just being. Not euphoric. Have not stood up since I took the 2C-I. Calm. Content. My thoughts are about relationship stuff, but they are more `observational,' detached, personal inventory, with some insights, rather than `analysing.' *No self-judgment* -- what a relief. 



T6:15 - This is how it differs from 2-CB --$>$ A little slower thoughts, `more langorous,' insights that can sink in deeper. Not too fast. Maybe that's just because it's such a small dose.



T10:00  - Been off the 2C-I for about 2 hours. Feeling totally mentally alert without speediness, and also aware that my body has been up for a long time, and that I skipped dinner. Not starving, but I grab some bread to eat. 



T11:30 - Still mentally alert, body tired but not quite `cracked out.' NOT delerious like I might be if I was just up really really late with no stimulants.



T12:00 - Take 1 tsp of GHB and go to bed. 



T15:00 - Wake up. G's worn off. Want to sleep, but can't. Thinking speeded up. Maybe the aminorex is still there a little. Drink some water and try to sleep some more. Can't. Eat. Decide to be up for the day. 



So, overall, I was really pleased with this combo, it enhanced my party experience and chased the blues. I felt very good the next day. Glad that I stuck to my small dose instinct. I felt like the aminorex was a good launching point for the 2C-I, though I normally like to try a new material on a blank mental state. Because the aminorex felt like it was generically slightly stimulating and opening, I may have been `primed' for the 2C-I (i.e. no anxiety). The aminorex is very long-lasting. Definitely something to factor in when doing it.
