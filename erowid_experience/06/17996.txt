A little background: I'm 15, about 165 pounds,  I'm just starting out on fluoxetine (20mg/day), and I've been using various substances for the past year or so. At this point, my parents know about my drug use and the following day, I'm scheduled to go and have an interview at the local drug rehab program. I'm terrified, confused, and incredibly cheap.



Yesterday, I got offered Adderall. Not knowing what Adderall is, I said yes. The next day, I pick up my score for a mere four bucks and change (gotta love connections). That night, I cut half of the powder and snort it. It's surprisingly soft and light (the easiest and most pleasant powder I've ever snorted).



By the way, I snorted the stuff at approximately 12:00am



T+0:05 I can feel it now, a huge headrush and a blast of energy, I'm shaking all over, and I'm jittery and anxious, but in a good way, like I'm just fully awake and aware.



T+0:30 wow, this is unreal. I'm IMing (which I usually hate doing) upwards of 20 people at once, and staying in tune to every conversation. This stuff is godly.



T+1:00 I figure this must be full effect, because I'm not only totally high, but I'm also quite paranoid (every sound is my father coming to my room about to catch me). I decide to write a report for health class on the dangers of abusing prescription drugs (oh, the irony).



T+1:30 I'm finished with the report and now I'm bored again. My lord, does this stuff ever quit? I hope not. I continue talking to people, desperately searching for AIM screen names on the net for random people to talk to. I realize that the dose of speed I took was way, way, way more than enough to just keep me focused. I realize that I am completely and utterly fucked up beyond recognition.



T+2:30 I can feel a little bit of fade, so I relax and try to find something to read. Where do I end up, but reading about drugs on the internet! What better way to get your mind off of a drug experience than to read peoples' stories of using the drug you're on!



T+4:00 Oh my god, I'm in pain. It's like I can feel every precious molecule of speed in my brain being broken down and destroyed, leaving me begging my body to open up the bag and do the next line. Now it's 4 am, I'm scared and I give in, of course. I quickly roll a single and rail the rest of my speed. Soon it's again wreaking havoc on me, but not quite as drop-dead gorgeous as the first line. It's true what they say, that you always remember your first time.



Four hours later, I crash in the middle of math class. I sit behind a very, very dear friend whom I love with all I've got, and I tell her the story. I'm crying, suicidal, ready to die without speed.



I love love love love love this drug. Nothing else compares in my mind. It's orgasmic, and beautiful, and perfect. I can't risk my sanity on ever doing it again.
