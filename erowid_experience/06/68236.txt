 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# 



OK This was the most intense trip I had ever had at the time.



I took 8 ccc waited about an hour for it to kick in once I started feeling the effects I poped the 2ci, listened to NIN, its a great band. Well the song slipping away came on, this was the first time I had ever listened to it but it was great, it descibed my mood perfectly. During that song I was put into a trance and came out with a feeling that I was struck by lightning or struck by god. When I came to I thought I had been worshiping the devil. I had brought on the appocolypse. Life would never be the same.  I almost started crying but resisted the urge. I looked at my computer and saw the welcome screen so I thought I was in the new world. I saw my name on the screen so I was the creator, I was also the destroyer. I was shiva, the god of destruction and creation. Thoughts if being in hell crossed my mind, also thoughts of being in heven crossed my mind too. No I was in purgatory. At one point I thought I was enlightened. Maybe I really was. People were telling me that in enlightenment it made perfect sense, at the time and I beleived it.



Well the night dragged on but after the trip I beleived that everybody had the potential to be a god.
