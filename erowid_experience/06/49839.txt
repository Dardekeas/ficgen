This report is about my most recent relapse on opoids, in this case, an off brand 80mg `oxycontin' it was not the abnormally shaped generic that isn't easily injectable, it was the same shape and color as a name brand 80mg Oxycontin, but instead of `OC' it had three letters, starting with an A as I recall.  I was told it was a Canadian brand.  It should be noted that I have quite a high tolerance to opoids and benzodiazepines (Xanax).  When I was actively addicted to opoids (about 8 months), when I could afford to do as much opoids as I wanted, I would usually do a dangerous amount.  I would either snort up to 240mg of oxycontin in a day, smoke up to 22.5 mg of fentanyl in a day, drink up to 150mg of liquid methadone, or snort up to half a gram of high quality black tar heroin.  A month after I had quit opoids, I ate 18mg of Clonazepam and a few beers, I went swimming in the lake for a while with no problems, then came back inside and went into a completely amnesiac stupor for about 16 hours, and a very amnesiac for the next 10 days, ( I wrecked my car 3 days later from the residual effects).  Now onto the fun.

Wednesday afternoon, Decemebr 15th I believe, I had about 4-5 grams of Grade-A Cannabis, I had already taken my daily 150mg Effexor XR (venlafaxine) capsule.  I hadn't taken any opoids in about 4 months.  Not feeling sufficiently sedated, I went to my Xanax (alprazolam) dealer's house.  I purchased 10 2mg bars for 50 dollars.  I immediately snorted 4mg.  This was around 4 or 5 o'clock  The rest of the following day (and to a lesser degree the following month) was pretty hazy.  over the next few hours, I ate and snorted 8 of the 2mg bars, of course I originally assumed I had done all 10 bars, as the next day I couldn't find any (I found the other 2 on my floor several days later).  By my best estimates, it was around 8 or 9 o'clock when I went to my local sex shop to purchase 3 cases (72 cartridges or nitrous oxide).  I probably did about 12 on my 10 minute ride home.  I did the rest in about an hour.  

So it's around 10? or 11? o'clock, really no way to know, when I decided that the MASSIVE amount of Xanax I had consumed was not enough to quiet my hunger for opiates, I called my connection, and asked if he could help me out, he told me he could get me an 80mg Ocycontin for 45\$, I told him all I had was 40, and that I would make it up with Cannabis, he reluctantly agreed.  I drove over to his house  \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# , QUITE fucked up from the Xanax, I made it there without serious incident, thoguh it took me a long while to find his house.  Now normally when I used opiates, I didn't shoot up, I had only done it a few times in the past, and wasn't crazy about it, as I usually had the money to make it unnecessary.  But that was not the case this time.  As I hurried inside, I was already removing my jacket and shirt, one of my junkie pals recognized my desire and went to retrieve his syringe.  Up until this point, I had only used brand new, self purchased needles, for fear of disease, but at the time, I didn't give a fuck, I told him to rinse it out and get it ready, about that time, not feeling very patient, I had had 40mg of the pill broken down into a line, which I snorted.  

Very high now, relaxed, in total control, happy.  A few minutes later, he had another 20mg ready in the rig.  I sat down on the floor, he found my mainline registered a beautiful red bloom of passion, and drove it home, I fell back almost as quickly as he could remove the works, I was probably higher than I had ever been, but I honestly don't remember.  The next thing I remember was waking up on the floor with blankets over me, I asked my friend when I got the blankets, he said he put them on me, cause I looked extremely cold and was breathing shallow, he seemed pretty pissed, and said I'd better handle my shit or leave.  I told him I was fine, and to put my last 20mg in the rig, which he suppsedly did.  I know I had 2 injection sites from the night, and I was pretty sure I remembered the second shot, but thinking back, it makes no sense that one of them wouldnt have done the 20mg I left out, but he put something in my arm. oh well.  at about 5 in the morning, my friend woek me up and told me he needed a ride to work, I was barely conscious, and almost out of gas, but I reluctantly agreed, on the way there, I ran out of gas, and we had to wait for his coworker to meet us.  

Well, long story short, I've been clean about a month, and I would kill for some Tar about right now, and seeing as I have 20\$ in my pocket, I just may go listening for the siren's song.
