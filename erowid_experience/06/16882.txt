As a chronic sufferer of cluster headaches for the past year I was desperate to find a way out of the random pain prison. I lost 2 businesses, a commercial building, and countless nights of sleep. Preventatives dealt with symptoms (miserably I might add) and I needed to get to the cause. The following is a brief report of limited success with psilocybin mushrooms.



Ordered spores and bag for sterile growing. 

Harvested and dried.

Detoxed on all medication for 2 weeks prior to ingestion.



Began with 2 grams dried and got slight hallucinations with a mild attack at the end of the evening. This was unusual since all attacks for me are severe and last $>$20 minutes. After this first dose I was H/A free for about 6 days with minor shadows. From my reading I decided to do a follow up dose again with 2 grams. Almost identical response occurred with a mild attack at the end of the trip. 



I got a typical severe attack about 5 days later. Being chronic I attempted to raise the dose as 2 grams provided some relief perhaps 3 would provide a bit more. Basically, I was looking to break the cycle and find the least amount of discomfort (the ride) in amount of mushrooms as possible. The 3 gram trial went on week after week for about 4 consecutive weekends with similar patterns of end of trip Headache and shadows between dosing. 



Finally I tried a 4 gram treatment about six weeks ago and have only had a handful of attacks with the same characteristics as before the mushroom treatment. That would be an attack almost every day the very second my eyes opened in the morning. 



In summation I have had mixed results with psilocybin treatment as a chronic sufferer and will re-visit this therapy if/when I detect a change in the manifestation of the headaches. Clearly this therapy has a direct effect on the neurophysiology of our condition and I'm very grateful to those who have helped to amass knowledge on this subject.
