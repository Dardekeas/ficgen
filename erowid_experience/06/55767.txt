This is definite K Hole territory. As it was.



Anyway:

I cut out two phat 100mg lines, chopped up into very fine powder. I then insufflated both, one after another - one for each nostril. Ow. Burnt quite badly. I then prepared a NOS for later on, chucking a cartridge into the cracker and stretching a balloon over the outlet, and put it next to my bed for later. Here is the Word file I had open to document the effects if I were able to. Here, you can see that I gave up rather quickly, haha!



*****

T+0 200mg ketamine insufflated

T+5 Onset of effects

T+10 the effects have grown hugely in intens

*****



I gave up at that point, crawling into my bed, grabbing my MP3 player (which I had prepared beforehand so all I had to do was put the headphones on and push play, thankfully - filled with full on Psy) and then curling into the foetal position - I wanted to minimize movement to minimize any possibility of nausea, as I knew this would be disasterous given that the world was already in fragments around me so I wouldn't be able to get outside.



Very intense OEV's and CEV's. Still getting stronger, much stronger, and I realize this is only the beginning. I operate the NOS cracker while I'm still able to (with considerable difficulty). Unfortunately, the full on Psy I had so carefully planned sounded faraway and distant, as though being heard underwater - still very enjoyable, though. NMDA antagonist psychedelics don't seem to agree with sound. As I sensed the experience began to peak out (in orbit around the Earth at this time Laughing out Loud), I had the nitrous.



\#\#\# Bye Bye \#\#\#

Now, ALL the previous times I've had nitrous recently, it's seemed to hit a peach-tinted white `wall', overlaid with green Spirograph-esque patterning, and can go no further. I had been VERY frustrated with this, as I sensed great things to see and behold were behind that wall if I could overcome them.



There was no problem this time. Synergy of NMDA antagonists, weow! Forget about going over it, I blasted straight through it (fragments flew everywhere!) and began to slide down a slope made of kaledoscopic vinyl, with a sheer drop at the end. The strangest thing, at the edges of the hill were literally thousands of ceramic garden Gnomes, completely animated, all chanting in synchrony `A new way to say\ldots  HOORAY!' - a excerpt \& abstraction of lyrics written by Syd Barrett of (formerly) Pink Floyd and later used by Terence McKenna \& Shpongle, I believe - but I disgress.



The sheer drop approached. I did not resist. Over I went.

Below - a HUGE (it went on for as far as I could see it) gridlike structure of pinpoint lights, seething with energy. It was like, um, how in the film The Matrix they have the farms of human bodies producing electricity - except somehow friendly and welcoming. The collective consciousness.

White tendrils of energy enveloped me, and all I knew was forever *Purity*.

I had been waiting to get here, I am home. Such incredible beauty.

I have absolutely no idea how long was spent there in this state.

But, I am thankful of every second of it. I'll return, sometime, but not for quite some time, until I have some more good questions to ask. Good answers require good questions.

:)
