Ok, this was one of the most weird and unforgettable experiences of my life. First off I bought a bottle of no-named Gravol from a local pharmacy. 50 pills at 50mg a piece.  Me and a friend wanted to trip out hardcore so each downed 17 pills. I remember the wait for it to kick in was a little bit frustrating but it paid off.



After about an hour I noticed that when I would move my head I couldn't really feel it but I knew it was turning. I felt really light headed but at the same time had to try to keep my head up because it was sooo heavy. Kinda weird but that's how it was. I started to get a little worked up and decided to go hop into the shower to mellow out a bit. While in the shower I kept seeing the shower curtain twitching alot, almost like little bubbles were inflating out of it then quickly deflating, sorta like a heart beat. I was very amused at this but could not tell if it was real or a hallucination. I went and looked really close to it and it still did the same thing. I touched but it stopped, but the minute I let go it started again.



After that I got out of the shower ran down stairs but found it incredibly hard to run. My feet were soooo heavy but felt so light that I could walk on air. I had barley enough balance keep me standing so I laid down on my bed. Things started to get a little intense for me so I buried my head into my pillows. I remember that even though I was awake I could dream with my eyes open. I could stare off till the point that all I saw was black. I kept awaking from these `dreams' and asking my friend where certain items that dreamt about were.



My short term memory was gone. None whatsoever. I would start a sentence and around the second word I'd forget what I was going to say and what I had just said. If I stared at the wall I would see a clear smoke-like substance spread all over the place. Looked sorta like the creature from the show predater. I remember when I started to come down that I got extremely itchy and though spiders were crawling all over me. But I was laughing alot at the stupidity it had induced to me. I also remember hearing voices from upstairs, even though there was no one home.



All in all it was a great experience. I would recommend it but beware, read into it first and make sure you are mentally strong enough to handle it. I would easily classify this drug in the same category as mushrooms. It is alot similar to mushrooms but for me, more hallucinations. I will definitely do this again, perhaps at a stronger dose.
