00:00 Chewed around 6g of dried Calamus root. Tasted absolutely revolting, although I somehow managed to pretty much chew the life out of it.



01:00 Took a BZP/TFMPP `legal high' pill. My original experiment wasn't going to include one, but in a moment of madness I decided that it would be a good idea



01:40 Start coming up on the pill, vaguely like coming up on an ecstacy tablet, although definitely not the same.



02:00 Most definitely `up' now. Feels a bit trippy, lots of head rushes and fairly euphoric. `E' is probably the closest drug I've taken to it, but I wouldn't say that they were similar. Still, quite good fun.



02:45 Guess I must've been coming back down at this point, didn't make exact measurements.



03:30 Most definitely `down' from the pill at this point, but still feel fairly inebriated. Stimulated, full of energy, lack of concentration.



04:00 Stomach starts churning a little bit. Nothing too serious, but (very) mild discomfort. Still stimulated. Start getting some mild open eye visuals, which gradually become stronger



05:00 OEVs probably at their strongest at this point, mostly different coloured geometric shapes \& patterns, but also briefly misidentifying things (eg thinking a coat was a cat for a second). Strange, but not unpleasant.



06:00 OEVs now very mild, decide to go and lie down to try to get some sleep



07:00 Can't sleep, still very much stimulated. Not noticing any OEVs, but whenever I close my eyes I start dreaming - even though I was still awake. Visuals very much like one would experience in a dream, although none last for more than a few seconds.



10:00 Finally get to sleep. Throughout previous 3 hours, perpetually on a cylce of closing my eyes, dreaming for a few seconds, opening my eyes, closing my eyes, \ldots 



Over this period, I drank a lot of water. Got very dehydrated for much of the experience, I would say that it was vital for anyone trying to re-create this experience to avoid alcohol at all costs, as it would be extremely dangerous. As a word of caution, my pupils were extremely dilated throughout the experience and for several hours the next morning.



Woke up very early the next day, felt lethargic, apathetic and anti-social. Eventually decided to go for a ride on my bicycle, which helped a bit.



Overall, it was a fairly enjoyable experience. Would probably do it again at some point, although not on a regular basis. I've never tried LSD and so can't compare with that, but it was certainly more hallucionogenic than anything I'd had before.
