Well it turns out that i have found a way to obtain a chemical mass of concentrated psilocybin. It took an beginner level of chemical knowledge to do it, and i dont suppose even a person disinterested in chemistry would have trouble doing it. 





It all started about 6 months ago. i bought 14 grams of psilocybin cubensis from my friend who grew them in his own house, and it was his notion that i make some Shroom Tea. I have never made shroom tea before so later that night i carefully weighed out 3.5 grams of these bone-dry mushrooms. i do know as scientific fact that:



1 parts of psilocybin is soluble in 20 part water. [Erowid Note: This is true if the water is boiling.] 1 gram of psilocybin cubensis contains about 10 mg psilocybin (thats not to say psilocin and baecytosin are not apart of this, its just that it would be too complicated if i used them as apart of my variables). [Erowid Note: 1\% psilocybin content is higher than what is usually reported for dried P. cubensis. The range is quite variable. It would be much safer to say that 1 gram of P. cubensis usually has a psilocybin content of 1 mg to 10 mg.]



Well i wanted to take precaution with my work, so i finely chopped the mushrooms up with my fancy vegetable chopper. Hey Man, this thing worked so well that the mushrooms were basically as fine as coffee grounds.  I  heated 8 0z. of water to about 90 degrese celcius (very close to boiling) and plopped the mushroom grounds in. After a few minutes i noticed that the water got a  light brown tint. I figured heat would help the dissolving of the psilocybin so i put the mushroom/H2O solution in a coffee cup with a lid to reduce heat loss. 



After about 30 minutes the brown tint got a little more darker, and i thought about straining the mushroom and drinking this liquid, but i didnt. i just let it sit on the counter until the water got cold, and i passed out. 



The next morning i took the cup and strained out the mushrooms throught a coffee filter. After soaking in water for about 10 hours i was pretty sure the psilocybin was completly dissolved. Ok, psilocybin that comes from straight from the mushrooms is not attached to an acid, so i added 2 teaspoons of muratic acid, and 2 teaspoons of pure naptha to the solution (by this point i had no intentions of drinking the tea, but to extract the psilocybin). I shook up the solution violently for about 10 minutes,  and decided to pour it into a mason jar with one of those Oxygen absorbing packets you find in beef jerkey packages taped to the underside of the lid, because psilocybin oxidizes easily, and to reduce bacteria growth. i let this sit for like an hour before i decided to abandon this idea. so i just simply used an eye dropper to suck all the napthat off the top layer. i poured the napthat out onto some wax paper and let it evaporate.



The substance left was this greasy, dark yellow mass of film. When i scraped it all up and rolled it into a ball it was about the size of a pea. I had no hesitations to consume it right then and there. I didnt even wash it down, i chewed it so i could remember what it would taste like.  Hmm\ldots yes indeed, it actually had no taste which suprised me. I took it on an empty stomach in the afternoon with a cup of orange juice. HAHAHA and in about 15 minutes i felt the first effects of psilocybin. Remember now that i used 3.5 grams. I peaked at about the half hour mark. The effect was probably equivalent to 2.5 or 3 grams. not 3.5, i expected to lose some psilocybin somehow, if i were to repeat the naptha extraction perhaps i would have gotten a little more. but at that time I was aestheticly satisfied, and for the whole 5 hours i was on the drug, i couldn't help by get revelations that this is going to change the history of mushroom use. i doubt it though. 



i LOVE the chemistry, but i also enjoy the fruits of my labor   ,)



i think the reason there are no psilocybin extrations out there is because nobody has thought about it! if it is done with dmt it can be done with psilocybin/psilocin etc\ldots  blah blah blah!



But indeed my product wasn't pure, it was still exciting breakthrough. since then i have done this extraction simply to impress some psychonauts, and i have tried smoking it..it doesnt burn or vaporize, at least at normal BIC lighter temperatures.  



peace Erowid, and viewers.



sincerely,



well\ldots you can just call me master sergent.
