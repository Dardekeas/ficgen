NOTE: `SD' is a friend I talked to via an instant messaging application.



I am in my living room, alone. I weighed out 100mg of ketamine powder that I have prepared from liquid ketamine which I obtained from an online source. I split it up into 10 bumps and put the mirror on a small table next to my bed. I have also prepared a bucket in case I have to throw up, something to write and a bottle of water. the only thing I ate a few hours before was a few slices of pineapple.



I'm a little anxious, my palms are a bit sweaty. I look at my alarm clock.



20:14: insufflate 5mg into each nostril - it doesn't burn much. I get back into the living room to put on some music and talk to people on irc. about five minutes later I can feel `something' - my heart rate has gone up and it's a bit pounding, but I think it's just anticipation. I can also feel something else being different, but I don't quite know what it is. probably just a placebo effect. very light nausea is coming up, but I can easily ignore it.



20:39: I decide to add 10mg (5mg/nostril) and get back to the computer. I feel like there is cotton in my head.. not comfortable, not uncomfortable.. I can taste the ketamine in the back of my throat, the effects described before increase a little.



21:00: I snort 10mg and get back to the computer. I move and walk slowly, and it feels strange. the nausea has increased a bit and I am waiting for some more effects. moving my head feels weird, and I get quite talkative on irc. it's probably just my desire for distraction.



21:17: I'm not feeling anything of what I expected to happen yet, so I add 10mg. sometimes I lie down because I'm feeling heavy.. I close my eyes but all I see is black.



21:38: I add 10mg. shortly after I think something is happening, I get up from my chair and lie down on the sofa. I even close my eyes, but nothing happens. it's like I was about to cross the threshold of something, but it didn't quite work. I get back to irc and talk to people.. I make lots of typos, but I don't care.



22:06: apart from feeling nauseous in a `good' way and knowing that something is `different', I don't feel much. I can walk without any major problems, I even go to the bathroom. when I look in the mirror everything seems to be normal. I'm annoyed and add 20mg this time. when I type on irc, my fingers seem to feel very light, but so do the keys I type on, which I consider to be strange.



22:34: things are quite weird now, but even weed has given me wilder thoughts. I add 10mg. the noise from my pc seems to be incredibly loud now, but that only lasts for a minute or two. I have trouble moving my eyes, I feel like a curtain is being pulled up around me, but this happens very slowly. I think that I will be where I want when it's closed, but the curtain movement seems to have stalled. my lips feel numb like they do from coke, some parts of my body also feel `chemically' numb when I touch them. I also think I can `taste' an anaesthetic somewhere in my body (this is difficult to describe) - I can still walk, but I know that I would probably hit the floor if I wanted to run. when I look on the floor, I think my legs are very short, but I am higher above the ground as usual. again, this is difficult to describe. the numbness in my lips has decreased, and I can feel the taste of numbness on my tongue.



I feel like a lot of time has passed, though, but when I look at the clock I am amazed - I thought it was $\sim$4:00 already. I talk to SD (which I have been doing since about 21:45)



I clap my hands (I don't know why) and it sounds different, it sounds really cool. I pick some other ways to slap my hands together in order to make different sounds. I think everything feels like goo, and I try to dive into that thought, but it doesn't quite work. I am disappointed, but quite mindfucked. when I close my eyes, nothing happens. I make weird hissing sounds with my mouth because they sound cool.



23:00: most of the effects have worn off, and I decide to drink a beer and smoke a cigarette. it upsets my stomach a bit, but it's no problem. I feel pretty much normal, although the bottle feels `huge' in my hand when I take it from the fridge. the beer tastes good and refreshing.



00:00: SD asks me if I am sober, which I affirm. I'm quite disappointed - I didn't expect to k-hole, but some visuals or somewhat overwhelming effects would have been nice. I decide to drink another beer.



00:15: he decides to go to bed, which I consider to be a good idea. I decide to finish my beer and go to bed.. I go to the bathroom to rinse my nostrils with tap water. I notice a slight headache, but it's nothing too major. in my bedroom, I switch on the tv and watch CSI miami and a call-in talkshow afterwards, which ends at 2:00 - I don't remember hearing the outro music, so I assume I was asleep at around 2:00.



08:15: my alarm clock wakes me up - I don't have more trouble getting out of bed than usual. the headache is worse than when I went to bed, but it's not even enough for me to take an aspirin. when I blow my nose, my left nostril starts to bleed, but it stops a few minutes later after I plugged some tissue into it.



it was a somewhat disappointing experience. I'm $\sim$130lbs so I highly doubt the dose was wrong - 80mg insufflated for a first-timer should be more than enough. maybe I spaced the doses too far apart? maybe the ketamine was crap? who knows. I'm definitely going to try it again in a month or so. I had big expectations, but to sum it up, I felt like I drank two sixpacks of beer with strange chemicals in it.
