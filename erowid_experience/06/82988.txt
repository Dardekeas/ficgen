Hi there an thanks for reading. I am writing this report at the end of my experience with MDVP. This is a very very interesting drug. What I can say for certain is that it shares properties with most stims but that being said it effects everyone differently. First off I must advise this drug is stronger then my will power. Seriously it very moreish. I have consumed .06 over the last two days.  when i say .06 I mean .6 of a Point [gram]. I really don't need this much for this drug, really a few flecks will do me and keep me pumping for 2+ hours. I have been dosing with tiny tiny amounts for the last 48 hours the only side effect I have found is lack of appetite, cravings, sore muscles and utter boredom. DO NOT DO THIS DRUG ALONE!



Also of note is increase heart rate (I can feel it) don't push yourself. I don't want to dance either, but I'll want to talk and talk and talk. I have some lab rats that are using ATM and effects are varied, some get horny, some don't, some can eat, some cant.

***



Important part: The `I WANT TO SLEEP BUT CAN'T' is the worst bit, I will require 1) Booze (a shot of spirit will be good) 2) Any benzo.  I will be using 5MG Xanax

***



I believe this drug to be very very addictive, please only purchase in small quantities. Once I did that first line it was very VERY hard for me not to do another and another. If i was to recommend a dose size it would be 0.005g - I know that sounds weird but it is the truth, a little bit goes a long way.
