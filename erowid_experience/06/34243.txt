just recently i smoked a bowl of california poppies and it was one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had. it was about 11:00 at night and the full moon and stars were out. i turned all the lights off in my room and filled my pocket pipe up to the brim with raw california star (my nickname for california golden poppies--they look starlike to me). the stuff was a little rough on my lungs at first and i coughed a little but i eventually got used to it. upon finishing the bowl i set down my pipe and walked outside to see the night sky. i lay down in the grass and gazed up at the bright stars above. five minutes passed and i began to feel extremely relaxed and at peace with myself. i concentrated on one star and all the other stars began to `fade' out. i felt as if i was being drawn into my star and as if i knew all there was to know about it (its name, what it was [galaxy, planet, supernova etc.]). when i stopped concentrating on that one star all there other stars reappeared with a flash the literally made me blink. 



i glanced over at my house that felt miles away and thought `maybe i should be getting back now' but i couldn't stand up, and, more importantly, i didn't want to. i soon forgot that i had ever  thought about leaving in the first place. besides, the rocky ground felt as soft as my bed does. i felt something crawl across my hand but i didn't care. i thought about all my problems and `solved' them with this newfound sense of clarity. everything was good in the world. the sounds of the night animals only added to the peacefulness and the breeze felt heavenly. i soon forced myself to rise and when i looked around, i forgot that i had laid down in this particular area of my yard. as i began to walk back to my house i couldn't help but laugh at nothing. i forget that i had ever laid down in the first place. everything felt ages ago. i don't know how long i was out there, minutes? hours? i went into my room and sprawled out on my couch to watch a movie. wow, i never noticed how good this soundtrack was or how everything about this movie was perfect. 



i soon felt a sense of boredom (apathy) and lethargy but i just didn't care. i went to bed feeling like an enlightened man. when i woke up the next morning i felt extremely tired. this may have been an after effect of the poppies or just because i stayed up so late. i dunno. but what i do know is that california star trips are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! like a cross between opium, vicodin and weed (i got the munchies). peace out.
