my sister and i decided to get what we thought might be a `high' one night in december and nearly died. i decided to take 16 caffeine pills with a 200 mg amount of caffeine in each pill (equivalent to 2 cups of coffee) and drink a diet coke. my sister liked the idea because she thought it might be like speed. it was like hell. i shit three times i peed like a race horse about three times. i also thought maybe consuming some good h2o and some nourishing food might help but everything that went into my body came back up. i had an intense headache and body temperature that seemed to range from boiling to arctic freezing. i reached a point where i could not stop tremoring or shaking and my heart was pounding out of my chest. i really thought i was going to die. my sister had taken half the amount that i did and saw what i was going through. i had called an ambulance and was carried out in a stretcher and just about bounced out out of it from being unable to keep still. on the way to the hospital i blacked in and out and the blackouts got longer and longer. i was given numerous amounts of shots and hooked up to hooplas of equipment and was told to drink charcoal or i would die. my sister, i later found out went through the same thing just when i was hooked up to all of the monitors and what not. we were both told that we could have died from the amount of caffeine that we had taken. 



my reason for telling this to whomever is reading it would be, be aware of what how much something can do to you. i just thought i would be very awake. it turns out i was almost asleep permanently.
