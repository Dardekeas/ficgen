0:00 Now, I am just taking 15mg out of my container in which I synthesized the 2C-H and put it on my fingertip; then let it dissolve in my mouth. 



0:01 I feel excited but I know that there is nothing to be excited about. Also I am experiencing an extremely elevated mood and I am obsessing over almost everything that is out of place. 



0:02 I am extremely happy and feel very hot and the air around me envelopes my skin causing a tingly sensation. I have a fast heart rate and I am sweating; everything is very funny and I laugh at almost anything. 



0:05 My pupils are fully dilated and I am sweating but I am extremely happy and dance music makes me even happier. I am extremely paranoid and feel so happy.

 

0:10 My paranoia is extreme but my euphoria is at an all time high along with being in contact with inanimate objects which represent people. 



0:15 The effects have a slow decline and my pupils remain dilated but my heart rate is back to normal but I am still very happy. I now have a headache. 



0:20 I am now only experiencing a light headache but have a clear memory of everything that I did and when I think back upon it I feel happy. 

End
