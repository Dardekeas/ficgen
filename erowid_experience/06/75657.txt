Last summer, I have been prescribed 1 mg hydromorphone because of my severe back pain. As you probably know, one milligram is the weakest dose therefore I often used more than recommanded.



It was a normal friday night : me being alone at home. The events took place around 8 pm. I was about to take my 8 pm dose when I noticed a precaution note on the label : `'Never take with alcohol''. And of course, I wondered what it'd be like to do so. That's how stupid I am. Though I went on the web to have an idea of what I should be expecting. After reading tons of warnings about hydromorphone combined with alcohol, I finally decided to do it. I popped four milligrams and swallowed them with half a glass of vodka.



I was all excited and happy with the thoughts of the high I was about to feel. But the joy didn't last too long : the more I was waiting for a rush, the more I felt down. Opiates usually give me a soothing feeling but it wasn't soothing at all. 35 minutes after the ingestion, I was so down that I wasn't even able to think or feel anything. Seriously, I felt tired at the point where I wasn't even able to end my cigarette. This was scary. I immediately went to bed, knowing that my mind could turn off by any moment. I probably got asleep instantly because I don't remember anything from that moment.



I'm glad I only took 4 mg! In conclusion, not fun at all, and very dangerous because of respiratory depression. Please follow the notes on your script.
