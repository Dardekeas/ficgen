I can't beleive all the fuck-ups giving a bad rap to all these wonderful drugs. Especially nutmeg. It is this simple:  I've tripped a number of times on nutmeg and noticed that I'll easilly finish off a 64oz thing of Gatorade (not pop), and then not experience cottonmouth, nausea, or ANY negative effects at all.



Also in regards to taste. I found it pretty nasty, but not as much as others led on. You won't catch me shoving teaspoons of powder down my throat though. The first time I tried nutmeg, I dumped 15 grams in a big cup of soda, and well, it was nasty as fuck. The far superior way to do it is to take smaller parts of what I intend to take, mix and ingest those one at a time. The next time I tried nutmeg, I split the 20g of what I planned to get fucked up on into 4 parts, and dumped one in a cup of any drink, finished that, dump the next, drink, etc. Not only did I get it down overall faster, but I also went into the trip without the nauseating aftertaste already sickening me. 



Another thing that affects the quality of my trip is mindset. If I do feel nausea, I try to acknowledge it objectively rather than assume `oh, I've fucked up', `this will be horrible', or `oh christ, I'm gonna die painfully'. On many occasions I'd be on something, feel shitty, keep a zenlike or positive mindset, and have the nausea fade away, leaving only the bliss of drug-induced fuckedupness\ldots ahhhhh. I don't beleive in anything, but there's a lot we don't know about the mind, and it's easy to understand that if I panic or dwell on the nausea, then it will continue and probably get worse.



My take on the nutmeg experience:



On an empty stomach, I noticed some effects within 20-30 minutes. A gradually increasing stoned-type feeling, with an emphasis on happiness and lightness. I wasn't supplementing it with weed or anything at the time so what I felt was just the nutmeg. This feeling came back in random waves with varying degrees of intensity. I did kill the buzz at first by focussing on something (a report for my college class I think), and I regretted it because the effects were less obvious afterwards. It does come back though, and it will be a few (3-12 usually) hours before its intensity peaks. I personally didn't hallucinate while on nutmeg, but it could be the dose, or any number of things that prevented that. I have seen things on other otc (diphenhydramine), and illeagal drugs, but not yet this. 



Overall what I experienced is like a feminine version of being really stoned. It seemed less aggressive than weed, but powerful in its own way. A 100\% positive experience.
