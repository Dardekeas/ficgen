`Trip' does not even begin to describe the experience of Salvia D., it is more of a mental breakthrough. I began my second experience with the plant last night. My first experience was a week earlier in which I smoked one leaf and experienced a mild high best described as smoking a lot of marijuana. Last night I decided to unlock the real potential of the plant since last time I was too afraid to experience the full effects.



I prepared the room by lighting a scented candle and spreading a blanket on the floor. I played some Native American music as I packed my water pipe with half of a leaf. The pipe was filled with snow (a \_great\_ idea, cools the smoke to a very pleasant temperature) and I inhaled the load in one hit. I was careful to keep the flame on the material so that it would be vaporized as Salvia has a high vaporization temperature. I held the hit in for about 15 seconds while I packed the rest of the leaf into the bowl. After the second bowl the plant took over. The music playing had a guy talking over the background music and it suddenly struck me as hilarious. I began to laugh uncontrollably for aproximately three minuites. I cannot recall any real thought except that the music was so funny.



Four minutes after the last hit I was semi-coherent in that I could talk to my girlfriend about what I had experienced. I decided that I would smoke another leaf and extinguish all light and sound. With the room darkened I smoked half of a leaf and as I was going to smoke the other half, I completely left my body. The events of this experience are extremely difficult to relate in words. My existence melted away and I was aware that there was so much more in the universe. I was being pulled from my body in what I can best describe as waves. I was looking at my girlfriend through my body from inside of my mind, which was composed of the entire universe. I was slighly afraid of leaving my body because I suddenly had the feeling that I was in reality. I had completely forgotten that I had smoked the Salvia and this was now reality.



I saw what was beyond my comprehension. It was much like seeing the entire universe from a far point and being able to grasp all of reality. I began to slip out of my body and I had a faint glimpse of the reality that exists in the universe. Suddenly thoughts rushed through my head, but almost too quick to get a good grasp on them. I saw all of the `dimensions' of the universe. I began to think about odd things such as sex. I had a flash of my girlfriend and I naked, only I was looking at it from the point of view of me as a child. I couldn't quite comprehend any of it. I began doubting my reality, that is I was unsure if my life was real.



Suddenly I got the urge to leave the experience. I wanted to tell my girlfriend about everything that I had seen, and I wanted to go back to the comfortable reality that is my life. As I left the Salvia world, I was badly shaken. The experience was not bad, just overwhelming. I told my girlfriend to get a notepad and a pen so that I could dictate the experience. This is why having a trip sitter is crucial, you will want to make sense of what you have seen. I was still feeling the effects as I was dictating and I would have brief periods when I was not sure what reality was. I wanted to be completely sober because the experience was so powerful. I could not make sence of any of it, it was too overwhelming.



After spending twenty minutes dictating all I wanted to do was to lie with my girlfriend to be comforted of the frightening experience. I decided that I did not want to take Salvia again too soon because it was such a powerful experience. Today, however, I feel that I want to go back and fully experiance the Salvia reality.



Salvia is not a drug to be taken lightly. It should not be used to `get fucked up' because of the sheer depth to the experience. The effects leave the user confused and full of thoughts that are dificult to grasp. I am still struggling with the things that I have seen and experienced. If you choose to experience Salvia, you must be mentally prepared, if there is such a thing. There are people who want to mix salvia with other drugs, but I would recommend taking Salvia on its own; it is powerful enough alone. It gave me a completely new understanding of reality, and that is pretty powerful.
