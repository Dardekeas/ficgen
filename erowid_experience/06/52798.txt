I have been doing Oxycontin for about 4 years. It's my favorite durg in the world. You could put 3 hot girls ready and willing, money, and oxycontin in a room, I'm going for the oxys. 



Oxys make me the devil but with God's emotions. Everything that bothered me before I got high I show my wrath. Women, money, bills, and life all get the treatment. Me and my friend jay walk the streets yelling at people. We dont care. nothing scares us. We steal, lie, and sin to the word. It's like after I snort oxys and I feel the drip go down my throat, I feel like that ice cube song `The World is Mine'. Oxys bring out the worst in me. Everytime I got arrested I was on them. I treat cops like crap, kick the cruiser, and just be a bitch in general. These are dangerous. They say crack is the devils drug but not for me. Coming down is the worst part. Reality comes back. Sometimes I take more, sometimes I dont. I once did 6 oxys in a night. I fell asleep while making  out with my girl. Many days after I feel like shit cause oxys are all I think about. My advice is be careful. These are powerful and not for the weak.
