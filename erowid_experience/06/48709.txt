Strattera is a great experience.  I was interested in trying a new ADHD medicine.  I went to the doctor and he prescribed me with Strattera.  I had seen a commercial or 2 and remembered that it was a non-stimulant medication.  I checked out everything online before I tried it, but for some reason most of what I found was negative experiences.  I found a few positive cases and decided it was definitely worth a go.  So I took the pill.  It was supposed to kick in within the first hour but for some reason it never did.



I then realized that it had indeed kicked in, on a very very GRADUAL rate.  Nevertheless, I was starting to feel the effects.  At first I had a slight feeling of nausea accompanied by a little light-headedness.  It was actually a little like feeling stoned.  I looked it up and found a report about people getting `too high' when they mixed the two.  Where I am from (undisclosed) there is no such thing as getting `too high' so I loaded a big bowl in my water pipe and let the good times roll.



And wow after that bowl I felt FANTASTIC.  Definately something I have never experienced on Adderall.  It was GREAT.  I really enjoyed the rush I got.  We went to the grocery store to buy a lil bit of food (yes it decreases appetite but not as bad as adderall).  When I walked in, my high and senses went into overload.  It was quite an experience.



I am back at the place now and I still am very active.  I don't know what will  happen next but so far it has been quite enjoyable and I can study great now.  Worth it.
