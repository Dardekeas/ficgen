I have throughout the years read about experiences on psychoactives. Some of them happen to be quite interesting. I never really thought about submitting my own experiences (oh so many) to Erowid. Although it happens to be a Saturday night and I am alone where I am currently residing.

    

It would only be custom for me to first bring some background before proceeding. I am on the outside just a regular 21 year old guy. I most likely demonstrate some odd characteristics, but for the most part seem like an everyday guy; this is not the case. I actually have multiple disorders and go through an immense amount of psychological pain everyday. At the age of 16 I had never used any substance of any sort to achieve a high or euphoric frame of mind. In fact I was so against using drugs you couldn't pay me \$50 just to take a hit off a cigarette. I was just absolutely against the whole theory on ``getting high.'' Until one rainy night that is.

    

I was riding with a friend and he was as usual trying to convince me to have a drink with him. I would respond as usual I would not. We had gone over this quite some time. At the time my OCD would not let me achieve any satisfaction from a substance for it was not natural and against my ethics. Then, as fast as a bolt of lightning it occurred to me. Drugs are just substances, nothing more. All this time I have been against drugs and they are chemicals found in the brain and substances just as natural as grass that grows. It was unbelievable how I could just go from using absolutely nothing to, the sky is the limit.

    

I always have to of had a solid foundation and supportive statements for what I am doing. I kind of argue with myself. That night I had my first drink; along with a hangover I don't like to even think about. That was just initiation. I never have hangovers no matter how much I drink. I just need to remember to put some food on my stomach and it's lights out for me, I fall asleep or become tired rather quickly. This may be the reason why I only drink at night or two to five hours at least before sleep. After this massive transition I would soon move up.

    

I went from drinking alcohol to smoking pot, from smoking pot to taking lines of cocaine. The first time I did cocaine I remember looking at the pile of white powder and saying I will forever do this. My OCD for the first time had gone completely away and I felt not just normal, but great. Cocaine would soon fail to live up to my expectations. I remember the last time I did cocaine I fell on my bed after doing a few lines and thirty minutes later felt horrible and fatigued. I also found some errors as I went along.

    

First, drinking was fun, but only lasted a short while and I would become tired. Smoking pot massively increases my OCD over time and has effects on me much like an LSD experience, except with twists of a bad ``Trip.'' Second, nearly 80 to 90 percent of the drugs I obtained from the street were so impure that the effects became extremely mild. To top it off, it was expensive. I have wasted quite a bit of money in a short amount of time. Although I was new to the ``Drug Game'' and I'm sure I showed it. Not anymore however. In fact, I refuse to touch street. Even if it is given to me, I wont use. I stick strictly to the pharmaceuticals. My supply ``Comes straight from the Lab'' as I say it, although to very few.

    

As of now I am currently feeling alright. I have been taking stimulants for so long I have gained an incredible tolerance for it; both physically and mentally. I just ``popped'' 90 mg of Adderall and 15 mg of Meth. I have smoked a cigarette and am typing this article. I am not writing about tonight though, I am writing about that one night I became ``hooked.''

    

I had taken Adderall a few times before but felt nothing. Then one night around 7.00p.m a night of light came. I had only taken around 30 to 60 mgs of Adderall. I talked with some guy who happened to be there at the time and my OCD was quite active for different reasons. My other ``friends'' were upstairs with their girlfriends and the guy I was talking to soon fell asleep and I was left just watching a movie alone. I wasn't expecting anything because the first few nights I had taken Adderall it did nothing. When I think on it now, most substances don't effect me for the first couple of times. Anyhow, I was watching a movie and out of nowhere everything slows down. Just like ``sheeewwwww!'' I no longer move. 

    

Sensations sweep through my body like never before. I cannot take my eyes off the television and I sit in a relaxed position for hours. Every object seems to be glued down. I have never felt this great before. All I remember is massive waves of euphoria running though my body and I stay up the whole night. I go through about five movies like this until daylight breaks. The next morning I could not believe the experience I had. It was around 7.00am and I call my brother. I am now coming down, but nothing like cocaine. I was content with the gradual decline and accept the effects wearing off not upset, but in good tone. 

   

I always refer in my mind to that night being my best `High.' I was completely relaxed and ``glued down.'' This is now a new catch phrase. If I'm so strung out on good stuff when referring to stimulants, I'm `Glued'. There is a lot to continue on my activity with stimulants, but that night was one of the most enjoyable I ever had.
