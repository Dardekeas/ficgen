This was typed as it happened:



ingested: 2-3 tblspns of ginger, 1-2 tbspns of nutmeg, 11:45pm



12:34am: a nice, fuzzy, mellow buzz takes hold of me. watching Black Dog on tv; smile comes to my face, kinda like beginning of alky buzz



12:40am: euphoric feeling im experiencing is obviously from the ginger\ldots  very nice, a head rush/warm fuzzy feeling; slight tracers from nutmeg starting - very upbeat, wonderful feeling.



12:47am: i go out and smoke a cig; while looking up at the mysterious night sky, i start to hum that old song from the Lipitor/Life cereal commercials: `are the stars out tonite/is it cloudy or bright/i've only got eyes for yooooouuuu'\ldots walk around, feel uppity; stimulant feeling taking effect; when i get inside i remark to myself `i'm feeling good as fuck' and decide to pack up more capsules of ginger



12:55am: i pack another tblspn of ginger but decide not to ingest it yet. Event Horizon on next.



12:57am: experiencing music euphoria, feeling emotional sorta like how music grabs ahold of your emotionjs when you're tripping.



1:05am: nose feels tingly, i scratch it and oooh, feels so good; considering changing station - no tolerance for subplots, slow-moving movies\ldots . decide to watch a comedy - okay fuck that nothing is on tv as usual, i go into my room to listen to music



1:12am: on the radio: `don't go out tonite/there's a bad moon on the rise'



1:14am: the way music ahold of me it feels like i'm tripping; still slight tracers from nutmeg.



1:16am: i eat another half tblspn of ginger



1:33am: time moving quickly; i eat the other half tblspn; music becoming more intense; starting to sweat slightly around the temples\ldots  everything growing more intense. if i had alcohol it would definitely intoxicate me beyond all recognition, i know this for a fact because i had a shot or two of vodka a few hours ago and the feeling as a whole feels slightly intoxicating in its own rite:



`A hot infusion, called ginger tea, was once highly popular for its diaphoretic (having the power to increase sweating) effect (very good for colds i presume). Alcoholic extracts of ginger, termed essence of ginger, have been used as intoxicants'  Plus I read online that ginger is a good cardiovascular agent and good for the heart and migraines, along with nausea/motion sickness. I believe it, too.'



1:53am: well, coordination is definitely affected.



2:18am: okay, i feel the second wave kicking in\ldots  a warm feeling in my chest\ldots  i keep zoning out, listening to music on the headphones\ldots  visualization is hard, my thoughts keep staying in the present, hard to think about the past, but everything has a certain dramatic flare to it. it's definitely a stimulant but at the same time i feel mellow and relaxed\ldots  no sign of headache or stomach ache.



Epilogue: I went to bed around 3am and slept well, though I frequently woke towards daybreak with a stomach ache which may or may not be from the ginger.
