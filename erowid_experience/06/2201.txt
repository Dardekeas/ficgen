Two days previously, I had tried 20 mg 2-c-t-7 along with some 1,4 butanediol, weed and nitrous with only mild results\ldots  Having that under my belt, I decided that 30 mg of 2ct7 should not be a problem



9:00 a.m. (T+ 0:00) I wake up, put on the Howard Stern radio show, and gulp down 30 mg of 2CT7 I had dissolved in orange juice the night before\ldots  



9:30 (T+ 0:30) I begin to feel a slight pressure in the back of my head, and remember this as being the first symptom I experienced in my last experiment\ldots  No other sensations noted



9:55 (T+ 0:55) The pressure in my head has increased to the point of being moderately uncomfortable, and is now accompanied by a mild buzzing sensation in my chest, similar in some ways to 2C-B\ldots . I find myself staring off at the walls, which begin to breathe slightly and the marks on the wall take on a plastic LSD-like look to them\ldots  



10:15 (T+ 1:15) I find myself laughing uncontrollably to most of howard's jokes and am having a good time, despite some mild nausea\ldots  Staring at my arm and looking off to the wall, the visuals have become much more apparent, and look like a mix between visuals i would get on LSD and 2C-B\ldots  The pressure in my head and the general uneasiness seems to be subsiding somewhat, allowing me to concentrate on the materials' psychedelic component instead of the body load\ldots 



10:25 - 10:45 (T+ 1:25-1:45) Things have gone from a nice trippy climb, back to focusing on the body load\ldots  The nausea has gotten a lot worse and it is impossible to ignore\ldots  Reminds me of the nausea I get on DXM, except my stomach doesn't feel so heavy\ldots  I figure that 2ct7 for breakfast isn't the best thing I could have done, so I microwave myself some rice, since my appetite has not been affected, and it looks like just the thing to settle my stomach\ldots  I have a few bites, and since the nausea is becoming really unsettling, I take 2 tablespoons of pepto bismol in hopes of settling my stomach\ldots  I lay on my side for about ten minutes, trying to drown out the nausea with some of Howard's jokes\ldots 



10:55 (T+ 1:55) Vomiting is inescapable, so I run to a sink and spend the next five minutes violently vomiting the soul\ldots  I wash up, and while washing out my mouth notice small traces of blood which seem to have oriented from my esophagus contracting so hard\ldots  A few minutes later, the nausea seems to have subsided, but i wonder if it was worth the effort\ldots  



11:00 (T+ 2:00) I decide to try and get the experiment back on track\ldots  I take out my cracker and fill up a balloon with nitrous\ldots  I slowly take in the sweet air, and suddenly become very content\ldots  I lack any concern for my surroundings, and am brought to a land where my thoughts seem to flow easily in all directions, and I am impressed by the colorful fractals which I see\ldots  I slowly come back to reality, but everything has shifted a few degrees into the psychedelic zone\ldots 



11:05 - 11:15 (T+ 2:05-2:15) My mood has greatly improved, and i seem to have overcome the strong and unpleasant body load which i was previously experiencing\ldots  I fire up my bowl and take a few hits of some of some weed\ldots  Any trace nausea is finally gone\ldots  Sadly Howard, leaves the air, so I put on the Webster Hall CD and fire up a few more whippets\ldots  each time being fired off into a realm of fantasy thought and strong Lsd-like visuals and thought\ldots 



During this period I feel the 2ct7 really kicking in and prepare for a strong ride\ldots 



11:25 (T+2:25) I look at the clock and see that 10 minutes has disappeared since my last whippet\ldots  there is now a really strong stoning sensation, accompanied by an energy in my chest which i decide to try to shake off by walking around the house\ldots  I get up and notice a lot of disorientation and lack of coordination so i lay back down and re-enter my realm of techno music-trance and become overtaken by the strong open-eye-visuals\ldots  and visions that appear when i close my eyes\ldots  i feel some spiritual presence, and the general tone is very similar to a strong LSD-trip\ldots  i feel my ego slowly drifting away, and prepare for a rough ride\ldots 



11:45 (T+ 2:45) After a few more whippets, and a strong unpleasant neutral tone, i decide 1.5 ml of 1,4 should lift my spirits, so i stagger into the kitchen and 1.5 ml of 1,4 goes down the hatch\ldots  I should note that there is not a lose of balance, but a disconnection from my body into the mind, which makes concentrating on my movements difficult\ldots  i walk back into my room, turn up the music and lay-down and re-enter my trance in which thoughts along with colors and sounds intertwine and take me to a place far-removed from reality\ldots  I realize that i am still coming up, so i have a few more whippets and settle comfortably into a realm of fantasy and a gradual move into a totally foreign land of sense and thought\ldots 



12:10 (T+ 3:10) My thoughts have become really jumbled and i now truly appreciate the experience known as synasthesia\ldots  the trip has left it's LSD-like stage and has entered it's own fantastic plane of sight and sound\ldots  I see the music join waves of color and the two sense appear to be joined into a single linear plane in which the two senses appear to be the same\ldots  



12:25 - 1:00 (T+ 3:25-4:00) Time seems to be moving unbelievably slowly, and i feel the 1,4 kicking in from before, and like the mood lift so i take another 2 ml\ldots  I have just about finished the whippets\ldots  and my body now seems to be joined with the rest of my house, and seems rather 1 dimensional and more like a container of energy than any sort of tangible object\ldots  amazingly I have a burst of energy and start dancing my way up to the shower, stop at the computer, spend 10 minutes fumbling around with my e-mail and head back up to the shower, immersed in a world of flowing colors, sounds and thought\ldots  I jump in the shower, take a couple of hits and continue bathing\ldots  My memory becomes impaired by now, and i find concentrating on the experience difficult\ldots  I find myself in a world defined by thought, fantastic color/sound and an indescribable energy which i seem to be able to tap into at anytime\ldots  I simply concentrate and move my body to the rhythmic energy which seems to make up and define the entire universe\ldots  I get out of the shower, and due to my inability to judge time properly i have between 2-3 ml of 1,4 butanediol again\ldots . I try and play a CD in the living room player but am to confused and disoriented to work the CD player\ldots 



1:00-2:20 (T+ 4:00-5:20) I lay downstairs on the couch, just trying to control this serious mindfuck, but find my mind drifting off into nothingness\ldots  I hear the phone ringing but am too fucked up to even recognize it as a phone\ldots  I pass out and wake up to my brother who has come home and is wondering what the hell i am doing on the couch passed out with all the windows open in the middle of a cold snap\ldots  Luckily i left my bowl in my bedroom and spend the next 10 minutes readjusting to my surroundings, with the trip completely gone\ldots  I get occassional visual disturbances in my peripheral vision, but am otherwise at a plus 1 at the most\ldots  i am very surprised since in pihkal shulgin describes the duration from 8-15 hours\ldots  



I spent the rest of the day loafing around.. more than usual and easily fall asleep that night\ldots  I think i did way too much as it was easily one of the strongest trips i have ever had\ldots  there was a strong body load to overcome.. and the trip wasn't exactly happy, but more just a reality shift\ldots  I'm not sure how soon i'll repeat the experiment, and if i do i might introduce some MDMA and i will definitely drop the dose to 23-25 mg\ldots  all in all a learning experience
