Late last night I found that I could not sleep again. Like a serious nerd I was browsing an online encyclopedia for at least 6 straight hours, and on this occasion I was reading about the Marvel Comics universe to pass the time until I could get to sleep. In the past I have noticed that the encyclopedia has the effect of making me feel compelled to wander from article to article consuming input like Johnny 5 from the movie `Short Circuit'. It's is almost an addiction in itself. It's pretty sad actually. 



I have not gotten fucked up in a  while, and I found that I was very bored with myself after hours of internet use. I needed to do something to either get to sleep or to liven things up. Both, preferably. A member of my family uses tramadol for pain. I have taken this before, and it produces a pretty cool feeling that is similar in many ways to drunkenness, but without the mentality/beer goggles, and it is harder for others to detect that I am under the influence of something. It also leaves me feeling itchy all over the next day though. In addition to the tramadol, I have a dog that we must give barbiturates to alleviate seizures.	

	

I was not so sure about the Phenobarbital. It is my dog's meds for god's sake! Also, I have not tried it before and was reluctant to do so. However, I was experienced with the tramadol. Usually I take a 300mg dose of that and I feel great for a while. Not as good as smoking weed or getting drunk, but it does the trick usually. It does make me feel a little nauseous sometimes, and also the itchiness was undesirable. I decide to take half my usual dose to avoid the itchiness, taking 150mg at around 3:00 a.m. To supplement that, I also take 300mg Phenobarbital, just to try it out.



After about an hour, I feel a minimal level of effects, so I take an additional 240mg of Phenobarbital. I realize suddenly that I have not been drinking enough water, as my throat is very dry. After getting a drink, I do some Phenobarbital research. That is when I learned that the half-life for Phenobarbital was between 58 and 118 hours!



At this point, I began wishing there was more info, since I don't want to be fucked up for days. At around 4:30 a.m. I realize that I am staring at the computer with my mouth wide open. If I had any saliva, I would be drooling like crazy. After getting up to get another glass of water, I make of lot of noise bumping into things in the dark. I decide to go to bed to try and sleep it off these drunken symptoms. Things such as X-men and Phenobarbital occupy my thoughts until pass out.



It is now 2:30 in the afternoon the next day as I type this. I have somewhere to be soon, and I still feel fucked up. In retrospect this experience was a bad idea, now that I know how long it takes to go away. I would do it again though if I had nothing to worry about the next day.
