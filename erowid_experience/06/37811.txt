I just got arrested and put on six months of supervised probation for the possession of marijuana paraphinalia and some bullshit about contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Probably would be unsupervised if I didn't have the last charge. So I will be drug tested and I'm looking for legal ways to get high. Tobacco has always seemed to get me high. But I wanted to take it to a more, shall we say, spiritual level. Checking out the Natural American Spirit tobacco site, I came across their Pow-Wow Blend. Besides Nicotiania, it's got some sage, red willow, bearberry, and spearmint. These sounded good, and hey, didn't I read somewhere that sage contained a psychedlic? This could be interesting.



I'll have to say I was excited, my friend took me to a smoke shop and I bought a pouch of it. It's under the roll-your-own category, but it's really pipe tobacco, smoked one rolled cig and though it gave me a buzz, it was way too much. My pipe was stolen by the cops, so I needed a pipe! My friend dropped me off at another shop and I happened to glance an awesome wood pipe with native american carvings. This was the kind of pipe you need if you want to show true appreciation to the Pow-Wow Plend. 



Pow and Wow! This stuff's good. Tastes better than any tobacco I've ever had and smells like good incense. Leaves you with a little dry mouth though, but def gets you high. I just kept smoking it. Started to get insights about myself and my relation to nature, which is all anyone can hope for. I ended up smoking another rolled cig on account of my friend wanting to test out his rolling skills. I was a little hesitant, I did anyway, and I was done, no more. Felt a little overdone, been a little sick for the past few days too, so that didn't help, but I'm convinced it was nicotine withdrawel.



I was trippin! I took a yohimbe several hours earlier, didn't really feel it by this point, but it could have potentiated the effects. Nonetheless, I was in a stony haze, seeing thoughts visualized. When I read more about the Pow-Wow Blend online, it made me laugh when NAS explained that the added herbs were used by the Native Americans to `reach the spirit world'. No doubt. Different, but comparable to mj. 



I layed down and listened to the Doors, somehow the tribal undertones of their music were a perfect accompaniment to this experience. I will say that the effects are most pronounced when laying down with eyes closed. Walking around in the light, I was more in a dreamy state of clearheadedness\ldots but I'm just wanted to lay down and relax anyway. 



Dreaming: Very lucid, thought I was a warlock at one point, started flying around and I seriously thought it was real. I somehow snapped myself out of sleep and was making sure I wasn't on some sort of atropine trip. I've taken benadryl before; not cool. 



In conclusion, I'm gonna continue to do this stuff every day in every way until I get bored or find something better and just as legal. May I also point out that Native Americans kick ass.
