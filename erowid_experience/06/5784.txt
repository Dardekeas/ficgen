I've been enjoying mild MAO inhibitors such as passionflower, and was curious about yohimbe which is also listed as an MAO inhibitor.  I ordered my yohimbe online and received it in shaved bark form. I measured out 3tsps (half the recommended dosage), steeped it for 10 minutes in boiling water and added 3 tsps of lemonade mix (the natural kind made with asorbic acid), drank it slowly.



I felt nothing for 45 minutes.  Then all of a sudden I heard a pounding sound in my ears and I realized it was the sound of my blood pressure.  My heart was pounding a mile a minute and for one second I thought that I really fucked up and my heart was going to explode. Then I started vomiting profusely. My heart continued to beat at nearly three times it's normal level for almost two very very scary hours. It was as if I had been given a shot of adrenaline -- and in doing some research, i read that yohimbe blocks certain chemicals that naturally block adrenaline. 



I finished the trip by dumping the un-used yohimbe straight down the toilet. I would recommend this chemical only to people who love to be super stimulated, and who have the body type/weight to handle it.
