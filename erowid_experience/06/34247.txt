Firstly, this experience is not my own. It is one of my close friends, S, he has neither the time or patience to write a report, so he allowed me to write what we saw of his physical state, this report mainly concerns this, and the after effects. 

The body weight and gender entered are his. Unfortunately I cannot state the amount that was taken, but it was a `good' hit through a water bong.



His tolerance is somewhat `light weight,' even more so than the rest of us at our psychoactive experimenting stage. We were just finishing our ecstacy affair at the time, admitidly some months back now. We were then at the ages 18-20, and were all regular cannabis smokers. I can say however he ended up taking 2/3 times more than the rest of us, due to an accident filling the bong, and a general apathetic view point on sense.



Now, from our P.O.V.



He took the hit, yelped slightly, put the bong down, held steady for a few seconds, then lay back releasing the smoke. His body then tensed up, and he began to have terrible seisures. He could only manage grunts, and attempts to find out if he was okay inspired a slightly more aggressive grunt. He thrashed around a little, so a friend went over to him to try and get him on the floor, so he didn't fall anywhere. S then grabbed out at him, and dug his fingers into his arm, he looked at him with a rage in his eyes, but G moved away, and he went back to monging (I've been trying to find a politically correct term and failed).



+00.2/30 minutes



The behaviour had continued through all this time. Being rather stoned ourselves, we only managed to think to call FRANK (the Department of Health's Drug help line) to see what information we could get. And eventually to call an ambulance. By the time we had come to this, he had started to come around and was muttering things like `It won't stop' and slipping back into the spasms occasionally.



Now, from his reports to me, he said said he was outside of his body, trying to swim back, he could see himself clearly, but his body was lying still, in a void. He was unaware of what was going on around him, the experience shook him badly, but at the time it was neither bad or pleasent, just a persistant urge and frustration, and he didn't feel like any smoking afterwards.



The experience moves on a couple of months. 



S has been having serious troubles. We had come to believe that he had Dispersonalisation Disorder, as he was displaying many characteristics. The voices in his head quite literally didn't stop shouting at him, but he never understood a word of it, he became increasingly paranoid and withdrawn, but we still failed to see a culprit.



Time moved on and we finally figured that his spouts of `Nausea' (as described by Jean Paul Sartre) were triggered around getting stoned. I know it's not a very hard conclusion to hit, but we didn't expect that! S doesn't smoke anymore, although he resented it for a long time, now he has taken salvation elsewhere.



I still look for an answer into how the Salvia triggered a major change in how weed effected him, I do not think Salvia is a cause, just, as a I said, the trigger. This I hope will serve to remind us that we are not invincible, and that above all Salvia is to be respected.
