 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# 



My first experience with the substance DXM occured my sophmore year in high school. I had never heard of DXM or using coriciden cold and cough pills to get high. I had used lsd and mushrooms before though. A friend of mine told me she had some pills that would really mess me up, her pupils were very large and her speech was slurred. She told me this between classes so with all the commotion in the halls it was pretty hard to make out exaclty what she was saying. I was under the impression that she had taken a large amount of muscle relaxers. she asked me if i wanted some and i said yes. she handed me 8 small red pills, the writing on them had been smeared off from being in her pocket so I had no idea it was cold medicine, i still though i was taking muscle relaxers. 



I took all eight of them on my lunch period which was at 12:20 pm. The rest of my luch period went by with no reaction and most of of my next period. I began to think nothing was going to happen when i started to feel a little tipsy. I was happy about this because I wanted to get at least a little high from the pills. Within 15 minutes of the onset though I started to get worried as I realized that I was way more messed up then I originally anticipated. 



I was having a hard time keeping my head up and the entire room seemed to be spinning and warping around me. Another friend of mine looked at me and could tell something was wrong, she asked if i was ok to which I replied i wasn't sure. She told me that my pupils were very large. I began to feel hot so I asked the teacher if i could go to the bathroom,when i stood up from my desk thats when the shit really hit the fan, I could barely walk out of the room without falling. 



I stubled down the hall falling agains the lockers as i went, I felt like i was watching myself walk from behind, i know that sounds strange but that is the only way i know how to put it, Like i was watching me instead of being me. When I got to the bathroom i suddenly felt the urge to vomit, i puked befor i could reach the toilet. I went to the sink to splash some water on my face after i did i looked in the mirror and i couldn't believe what i was seeing. My eyes were so large i looked like an alien and the mirror seemed to be bulging in the middle. I was very scared because like i said i thought i had taken muscle relaxers. 



When i went back to the classroom i opened the door and after walking into the room i fell against the wall. the entire class started to laugh and the my teacher made a joke by saying `what'd you do James, smoke a joint in the bathroom'. Still very scared i replied that i wished that was the case. I took my seat and looked at my friend and told her that if i got any worse i would have to go to the hospital. Fortunately for me things did not get any worse they seemed to level out to a degree that i was able to handle it. 



After that period ended I was still very messed up, I found the girl that gave me the triple c's and asked her what she had given me. when she answered I almost crapped my pants. I spent the rest of the day feeling very messed up and very detached. i have done DXM since then but not from triple c's as i have researched the dangers of the other active ingredients in it.
