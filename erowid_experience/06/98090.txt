Ethylphenidate

Dosage: repeated



Method of ingestion: oral/insufflated



Experienced with a various array of drugs including: Adderall, Amphetamines, Cannabis/cannabinoids (JWH-018,122,UR-144), LSD, MDMA, Methylone (BK-MDMA), 4-MEC (4-methylethcathinone), Opiates (Oxy/Hydrocodone). Other things I can't remember.



I'm in good health and keep a good exercise routine. However, the night before I'd only slept about 2 hrs and then woke up early to finish a paper -- which ended up getting done!



Setting was at a club, with a well known EDM DJ playing. Was feeling a little tired from not sleeping much the night before, but overall in a good mood. Smoked some UR-144 (a favorite synthetic cannabinoid, highly recommended :] ) on the way down. This is recalling from memory a few days ago, to the best of my ability.





T 0:00 -- UR-144 smoked, just a little providing a relaxing effect



T +1:00 -- after arriving, settled in, smoked a little more UR on some cigs, still a good time



T +1:30 -- insufflated 20 mgs, I had heard it could take a little while to kick in, so I sat back and let it happen.



T +1:45 -- WOW -- ecstasy like euphoria, increasing. Very much like a light dose of MDMA, but lacking empathy -- very euphoric. A def +,



T +2:15 -- insufflated another 20 mgs, euphoria still very present, good feelings, VERY MDMA like in euphoria, very fun. ++! Massages are great. Getting awesome light shows -- crazy good time!



T +2:45 -- Feelin GREAT -- wishing I could tell people how great I feel. A song comes on that reminds me of a good time at a past music festival, want to cry tears of pure joy :D. +++. UR cigs smoked throughout, a highly recommended blend.



T +3:05 -- Last 20 mg's insufflated



T +3:10 -- UR dipped cig smoked, helps kick it in better!!!!



T +3:30 -- WAVES of euphoria, still kicking.



T +4:00 -- Much more stimulated than euphoric now, still glowing though :D. 



T +4:30 -- Concert over -- a GREAT show. A personal favorite artist of mine though, so naturally everything went well. 



T +5:30 -- still after-glowing, needed food. I have a rather fast metabolism, so I require food when on stimulant drugs. Feeling WAY way better after eating, stimulated, still operating at a +'ish level. Still feelin good.



T +6:30 -- Car ride home, still feelin good, desire to do more is present, so another 20 mg's is orally consumed, along with another 10-15mg's insufflated. At this point, two friends of mine, Friend A and B = who were rolling on molly decided to ingest some as well. 



Friend A had beautiful moon-rocks straight from the source, and after she ingested some Ethylphen intranasally - $\sim$15mg's, started rerolling -- feeling very good. Talking about how much she loves life.



Friend B had some pretty decent molly, and after ingesting a 20mg cap, and 10mg's intranasally, stated he felt very good -- and was surprised to the extent at which the EP was effecting him (He was feeling good at 160 mg's of Adderall in a past experience). Discuss how it can be used as replacement molly -- and how I looked as if I was rolling harder than he was, and he was on real molly.



T +8:00 -- Feeling way more stimulated than euphoric now, needed to study for a test. Oops, big mistake. Too cracked-out-silly feeling.



T +9:00 -- Stimulation still very present, my eyes are blurring intensely! If I try to focus on anything -- like my studying, eyes blur up real fast. Very annoying, Friend B's face is blurred. Friend A does some special K, gets some crazy CEV's; she tries sleeping, and can't. Friend B is still very up +.



T +10:00 -- Attempt at studying for my test fails miserably. Too hard to see computer screen to resume notes. Still feeling rather euphoric, but mostly stimulated. A calm stimulation is what I would call it. Yes. (Similar to how I'm feeling now, recounting this several days later on a similar dosage of EP). 



T +14:00 -- Test likely failed miserably, smoked a UR-144 cig to calm down any anxieties present with the slight come down.



T +18:00 -- Still stimmed up, can't really sleep, decide to go out to a party drinking. Break open another with Friend B around T +28:00. Bike riding around late at night, a fun time. Climbed a 30 foot tree.



T +30:00 Get home, riding out the feelings for another few hours.



T +40:00 -- Details of what happened here are fuzzy, just remember falling asleep sometime soon-after.



Overall review:



A fun drug. Definitely has party potential -- especially the initial hits -- very euphoric; almost just like rolling. Coulda been passed this off as bunk molly in the past actually; thinking about it. However, it had a very distinct appearance. White clumpy powder; very clumpy when grinding to snort as well, had to keep cutting it up a bunch of times.



Dosing past 60 mg's for me was way more speedy/amphetamine-like. Also, after oral dosing, followed by intranasal dosing, the blurred vision got to be rather intense! Too intense at some points; I could barely look straight ahead without my vision fuzzing. But if I looked side to side or more rapidly, I could focus. Furthermore, I had zero libido on this stuff. No sex drive whatsoever.



Overall, substance gets an 8/10 in my books. Definitely fun. Tiny hangover\ldots  nothing compared to other stimulants, easily cured by some cannabis or synthetic noids :).
