My background:


I'm a 45 y.o. who's had much experience with most drugs, etc.  I was a poly drug abuser as an 18-20 y.o. \& went through a 4 month drug rehab in 1977.  I then became a certified substance abuse counselor in 1988 \& was a counselor for 10 yrs\ldots  I wanted to give something back for my years of abuse, etc. 





I stopped using drugs in 1983 having had a 2 day/night spiritual experience\ldots  no need for details as GOD (Geometry Of your Divinity) makes these experiences unique for the individual \& quite unexplainable in human terms, etc.! I can say that I came into direct contact with GOD's love for us \& it is too powerfully amazing \& overwhelming, loving, \& compassionate to even try \& put into human terms.





My quest for spiritual truth has been ongoing throughout my life.  I have beliefs in Western \& Eastern teachings/philosophies\ldots reincarnation, karma, twin flames, charkas, etc., etc.!  I have been speaking to GOD on a daily basis for the past (almost) 20 yrs\ldots I talk to GOD just as I'm talking to a friend \& GOD has spoken back in so many amazing ways!  I've had many, many spiritual experiences\ldots I've experienced both good \& evil (energy veil).  But there is no force `out there' that is more omniscient, omnipotent, or omnipresent than GOD (our real Father/Mother).





In the past 20 yrs. I've smoked aprox. 10 joints of marijuana, along with a few beers/mixed drinks here \& there.  I'm not much of a drinker.





I came across some reference to `Salvia' on a message board \& started researching it.  I spent hours \& hours \& hours researching Salvia\ldots with no interest in mushrooms, DMT, MDMA, MDA, cocaine, marijuana, or other psychedelics, (done that, been there) etc.  For mine is a `spiritual journey of introspection' only \& I intuitively felt that all these other substances would not give me what I was looking for\ldots \& when I follow my intuition I'm always right!  I have since spent many nights up until 4:30am researching Salvia.  I was very intrigued due to the `spiritual introspection' aspect of Salvia.  





I purchased 3 grams\ldots each 1 gr. 10x extract (if I'm going to do this, then I'm going all the way with a 10x'er) from a popular vendor \& 2 gr. 10x extract \& a pipe from another that claims theirs is `organic'. I will say that both are very powerful, but I think the `organic' (a darker green) is just a little stronger.





My reason for using:  After all my research I felt I could come into direct contact with the `Heart'of our Father/Mother\ldots GOD \& `commune' directly with GOD!  My only purpose was in `s





piritual introspection', with no intent of using this `divine' substance to `get high', etc.  Little did I know how divine this experience would be (all 7 to date)!  All 7 experiences were variations on the same theme\ldots but intensified with each subsequent one\ldots while still using the same dosage each time!





My Experience:  I took 1 gram \& divided it into 14 sections \& then gel capped them.  I then took 1 gel cap \& dumped it out \& then divided it into 2 equal sections.  I prayed extensively to GOD as to why I was doing this \& called for protection, etc.  The room I used it in was my bedroom\ldots my bedroom is a very spiritual place for me\ldots I have an altar, many spiritual focuses\ldots Jesus, St. Germain, I Am Presence, Mother Mary, Sanat Kumara, Lady Master Venus, El Morya, Arch Angel Gabriel (and others), a huge amethyst stone, etc.  I was very comfortable \& felt safe.  Since I was doing this by myself I also prayed/called for safe protection in that I would not leave my office chair (because I was doing this by myself), etc. (which I never did in my 7 experiences to date).  I played mellow spiritual music with cordless headphones \& had the lights only slightly dimmed.  I put the dose of half a cap (1 fourteenth of a gram of 10x extract) into my pipe, lit it \& inhaled deeply \& held it for probably 30 seconds.  I was using a stopwatch \& at aprox. 20-25 seconds I could feel a `melting into my chair feeling'\ldots then nothingness for 7 to 8 minutes as I'm coming into a conscious state of awareness I feel the presence of GOD\ldots I don't think its GOD; I know within all my `being' that it is GOD.  I feel \& see the room wrapping/rolling over upon itself as if this reality (as we know it) is going to disappear as a speck of dust and I'm going to enter into the being of GOD\ldots but I kept pulling back saying ``not yet, not yet''!  WOW\ldots exactly 10 minutes of an unparalleled experience\ldots nothing, nothing, nothing can compare!  After 10 minutes everything was fairly normal; no hang over, heavy head, etc. feeling, I felt fine, but boy did I have questions! 





One question I had was\ldots Why did it take until the end of the experience for me to become consciously aware?  Well, I thought that the next time I use Salvia I will tape record myself\ldots and that's where it all begins! 





2cnd through 7th experiences\ldots Well I used 1/14 (that's all, one fourteenth) of a gram each time \& the same bedroom scenario was the same, only on the 3rd time I did not use any music at all.  Each experience lasted exactly 10 min., and each time it felt as if I was becoming consciously aware at the 7-8 min. mark.  I could sense that I was almost touching the very being of GOD \& again I didn't want to go all the way because I didn't feel that I would come back to my body, that I would remain in the `spiritual', `etheric' realm.  





I then listened to the tape recording of my experience \& that's where I was hearing myself talking out loud to beings I couldn't remember seeing.  I was asking why was all this (the universe) created\ldots they were telling me that they were waiting for me\ldots and I would tell them that they couldn't start without me (start what?\ldots I don't know).  I felt like I was at the hem of the garment of GOD's being \& that I was reaching up to touch the very being of GOD, but if I did I wouldn't be coming back to my physical body, but that I would remain there with GOD!





Whew!  You talk about something like this and no one can understand unless they've been there!  Well I can say this much\ldots the beauty, wonder, power \& most of all a warm, warm gentle, but so powerfully compassionate love that our creator has for us is AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME\ldots I was feeling like I was just ready to enter in to GOD's heart when all of a sudden I became aware of my physical self \& was feeling bad because my loved one's wouldn't know what happened to me if they were to find my body dead in my chair, even though I knew I wouldn't be dead!  I felt that I needed to really think about what has happened to me through these experiences.  





I've had many, many spiritual experiences, but nothing this phenomenal, etc.  Since using Salvia I have had a new, conscious awareness of GOD as never before\ldots as I've said earlier I had a very powerful spiritual experience in 1983 \& since then I've developed an almost daily `communion' with GOD that has been very loving \& enlightening!





There were many other statements, comments that I had made to my unknown/unseen friends-brothers/sisters (that is what they seemed like) while under the influence of Salvia.  My 1st use of the Salvia was on July 17, `02 \& my last use was on Aug., 4, '02\ldots and I intend to use again sometime on Sunday 8-11-02 or during that week.  I'll keep in touch. 





A Brother on the\ldots `Path' that only leads back to the `Heart' of our Father/Mother GOD! 





Father/Mother GOD I am grateful for the ``DEEPER'' understanding/contact I'm having with your presence and I will only use Salvia for my own ``spiritual introspection''.  I am yours and I am also grateful to begin to know what it means to be  ``LOVE''.  For we are hear on this earth to learn how to `love' and to be that `love' in action forevermore!





Your child\ldots becoming your `Son'.


Thank You\ldots Father/Mother GOD!
