First off I would just like to say pardon any spelling or grammatical mistakes I might have while writing this as I am currently under the influence and also as much as I love pharmacuitiacals and drugs I don't know the proper spellings of all of them. And also not only the high doses but the combinations of drugs I took can be fatal and I do not encourage any one to do the things I did. That being said let me get on with my story.



This took place roughly 3 weeks to a month ago before I was kicked out of college. But one night I acquired some 30 mg temazepam capsules at roughly 9 pm, I proceeded to go to my dorm and after taking the powder out of five I them proceeded to snort it. Within 15 minutes I started to notice some loss of motion control and felt wobbly. 



I proceeded to go out to my colleges designated smoking gazebo to have a cigarette when out there I found a group of my friends enjoying a fifth a whiskey and smoking some weed. After taking a couple shots and hitting a bowl once of twice I definitely noticed I was starting to become intoxicated I stupidly went to my dorm room and snorted the powder in 2 more of the temazepam capsules and went back out to the gazebo to be with my friends. This is the part where my blackouts begin. My friends told I was sitting there not talking in a trance like state and they told me I took a couple more shots. Over a number of hours. However the next thing I remember is myself somewhat regaining my sobriety and realizing it was 4 am and that I had to be at work 8 am that morning.



A freind of mine offered to sell me some of his ADD medication a stimulant called concerta in a my still dazed state I thought it was a great idea and happily purchased 3 of the concerta pills and chewed them up. Within thirty minutes I felt totally strait and very awake I went and smoked cigarettes with my friend for a while and went to breakfast before work. 



I worked from 8 am to 3 pm and generally felt fine and felt the concerts was lasted awhile as I rarely felt tired despite my sleepless night. When I got off work I went to snort my remaining two tempamazam capsules and headed to class feeling a very drowsy feeling kick in with my motor and speech control slowly withering away. I recall attempting to pay attention in class for about the first 10 minutes then going to set my head down for what I intended to be a minute. That's when the next blackout started all I can remember is someone telling me class was over and staggering back to my dorm to sleep for the rest of the day. The next day my friends told me I had fallen asleep in class and that my teacher had tried multiple times to wake me up and even shook me with no response, I laughed and thought it was lucky an ambulance wasn't called. Roughly 3 weeks after that I was kicked out of college for an alcohol related arrest on campus.



Looking back on the experience temazepam can be a fun drug to do recreationally and I've done it again on several occasions but I would advise  anyone who tries it to limit there doses espescially when your first experimenting and never mix a benzo with concerta or any type of upper.
