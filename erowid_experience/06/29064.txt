I was so excited upon receiving my mail order HBW seeds.  I waited to finish my classes that day to begin ingesting them. I figured that since the trip supposedly lasts from 6-8 hours, I would have enough time to come down and go to sleep and wake up for class the next day. My room was dim and quiet. I decided to start with 6 seeds. I scraped and flamed off the hairs on the coat as best I could. I began chewing them and held them in my mouth for about 10 minutes, then swallowed.



I didn't feel anything, not even the popularly-claimed nausea. After an hour, I was somewhat disappointed. Since I had read reports of peple taking up to 14 seeds, I came to the conclusion that I simply hadn't eaten enough. So, I ate 4 more seeds. Still nothing; no nausea or hints of a trip coming. About a half an hour later, I was convinced that I still hadn't ingested enough, so I ate 4 more seeds.  Still, nothing. So, another fifteen minutes later, I ate 5 more seeds.



Well, that's a total of 19 seeds. I didn't feel a thing. I'm really disappointed. Maybe it's just the company I ordered from. But, I believe the trips are definitely possible! Just maybe I did something wrong, or I have a bad source. Good Luck!
