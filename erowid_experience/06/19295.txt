I've tried many a drugs in my day and I'm always looking for a new way to get high in a (for the most part) safe manner.  I had noticed that one of my parents had a prescription for Paxil for quite a while and only was interested in the drug because of its ability to block the neurotoxic effects of a favorite substance of mine\ldots  yes ecstasy. So once upon an evening I got bored and debated snorting one of the half pills in the bottle.  I had read lots of information on paxil and that it can have odd and addicting effects in some people, and still wasn't sure about doing it because many people do not respond the same to SSRI's.  But after hearing the experience from a friend, I decided to do it. 



My friend `N' was over this evening and I brought up two halfs of 20mg pills to my room for us to snort.  The friend that had claimed to snort paxil before warned me that it stung really bad, but being a pro in snorting prescription medications I believed I could handle it a bit better than her.  I proceeding to crush and grind up my half using one of my favorite pieces of literature (grapes of wrath) as my work space.  I snorted my line and realized that while snorting it the stuff didn't seem that bad. I was wrong, minutes later my nose and throat started stinging and water wasn't helping me.  I was walking around my room holding my face while my friend asked if I was okay. I lied saying it wasn't so bad, but then later suggested that he shouldn't even bother because the stinging wasn't leaving me.



I sat in a swivel chair in my room and waited for the drug to hit me.  I could feel something coming on, but wasn't sure what.  There was a slight pressure building in my face but this soon left me, I didn't really expect a body high anyway.  I couldn't quite tell what I was about to feel but I had an idea that it wasn't going to be good so I went and laid in my bed.  My friend was on the other side of the bed talking to me and as I was talking to him I realized that I was starting to shake.



I thought that it was just because I was nervous or slightly cold and I didn't want to tell him so he wouldn't worry.  I told N that I couldn't seem to control these slight convulsions and he said that he had noticed.  I tried focusing all my mental will on relaxing my body but it wouldn't stop shaking.  These quivers would come in waves and mostly seemed to be affecting my legs although sometimes my teeth would chatter as I spoke.



I laid awake for the next hour just hoping that my quivering and slight naseua would soon pass and within an hour to an hour and a half it did.  At this point I could attempt sleep, however I would wake abruptly when I started to dream.  I remember one vivid image of George Clooney's face covered in blood before sleeping.  Wierd.  I later woke up and actually felt slightly pleasent and a bit more warm, I fell back asleep only to wake up fairly early but not excessively groggy and still feeling alright.



I submitted this report mostly because I had never seen anyone snort Paxil before and was curious to whether or not it'd be fun to abuse, and apparently for me it isn't.  I don't know why I reacted the way I did, especially the fact that it would affect my serotonin system which shouldn't be responsible for muscle convulsions. I doubt many other's would have the same reaction as I did, it could just be because of all the extra tryptophan from thanksgiving leftover turkey but that might be a far stretch haha.
