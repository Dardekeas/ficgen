 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



I got up to my room and by myself and realized that I was way too fucked up.  My perception of time and sound were completely gone, I could barely hear anything, it was as if there were earplugs in my ears.  This was rather annoying.  I knew that the comedown was going to be brutal and that I would get no sleep this night and would be lucky to sleep the next night.  I chatted on the computer for a while and realized that it was really hard to type.  I was really out of my mind now, it kept coming on harder and harder with each drain I caught.  I started to get scared and sweaty.  My mind split into two levels, the one that was screwed up and in control, and the one that was sober and telling me that I was in trouble and `Oh my God this, oh my God that'.  I really started to freak out, I just wanted to go to sleep and wake up normal.  I even thought about waking my parents and telling them that I needed to go to the hospital but I was in no mind to lie and the supplier was on probation so I refused.



Urination was easy but when I thought I was done and proceeded to put it away, it kept dribbling, I had lost bladder control.  I was sweating like a hog and decided to at least lay down and try to sleep.  I kept drinking water to prevent dehydration.  When I layed down I realized how fast my heart was going.  Holy shit, way too fast.  I nearly shat my pants I was so scared.  I wondered how long it would be before it just blew up and I died.  I seriously thought I had overdosed and my heart was going to explode.  `How long can a heart go on beating at 3 million bpm?' I thought.  I remember thinking about the movie Blow where he says `The tolerance level for cocaine is between 2-3 grams depending on body weight\ldots '  I am a relatively small guy at only 135lbs.



I never got to sleep that night, and I had to drive 5 hours back to college the next morning, no good.  I layed there in bed freaking out waiting to die and watched the sun brighten my room.  When morning came I arose and my heart had not slowed one bit.  I was beginning to feel exhausted and like I just got beat up really bad or hit by a car.  My parents thought I was just sick and irritable so I left and drove back to college.  That was the worst drive of my life.  It would never end, I was exhausted but could never come near rest.  My heart was going so fast still.



That night it was the same routine, I just layed there my heart STILL racing and my head throbbing along with my body aches.  I didn't sleep that night either but the next morning I finally started to return to normal.  I didn't go to classes that day, instead I was able to sleep.  The sleep hit me like a train, fast and hard.  I woke up the next morning still sore and with a headache.  I pledged never to do coke again, and haven't since then.  Unless you count three days later when I caught a drain in chemistry lab.  Overall it was a horrible experience, and I'll never do it again.  It was only fun at the beginning, the 2 day comedown was definitely not worth 4 hours of bliss.
