66 year old male, 6'6', 250 lbs, good health. In the distant past I have had experience with LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, pot, hash and amphetamines. Alcohol and cocaine were my drugs of choice for most of my adulthood. I have been sober for over twenty years. I take prescribed modafinil and nortriptyline daily. I enjoy a (very) occasional joint or bit of hash.  



At the suggestion of a friend, I have been taking 30 mg JWH-200 orally for neuropathic pain. It gives me a mild body buzz, no euphoria. As it's a cannabinoid I figured there is little chance of any serious physical overdose, I have tried larger doses (100mg or so) on two occasions and gotten a heavier, woozy (and believe me I know from `woozy') buzz but again no euphoria.



I read that a typical dosage when smoked is 2-4mg. That seemed unrealistically small, so I gave it a try. Home alone, weekend afternoon. It blew the doors off. Hit in 30 seconds and popped me into a psychedelic fountain of competing realities. Hurtling down electric geometric day-glo crazy quilt tubes. Immersive, as `real' as the living room I was sitting in. Sometimes I was in them, sometimes I was them. Couldn't really tell if my eyes were open or not. Couldn't care either. The TV across the room did make an occasional guest appearance - a token reality that allowed me to remind myself that I'd taken a drug and would come down in a while. I toured my inner realities - looked at the things that made me tick at their most basic. They were at the ends of those tubes.  Beckoning. Receding just as fast as I was traveling. Needs. For connection. For love. Sex. Safety. Intimacy. Coexistent and competing pathways that twined, melded and split apart in a headlong rush forward. I'd be whooshing towards one when another tube, with a different goal,  would swing in from the side and have me flinging myself after something else. I'd always envisioned the human psyche as impassioned but deliberate, moving ahead at a walk. Apparently not. There's a whirlygig in there.  



About 45 minutes in my breakfast decided it wanted up and out and I coincidentally discovered that upright locomotion was an iffy proposition in this particular altered state. I made it to the bathroom (decades of alcoholic practice - I crawled) and lay in the tub slowly coming down for the next hour. 



All in all not the experience I had expected. Much, much deeper. Dissociative. No LSD `body electric.' No euphoric (or even emotional) component. It felt valid though. Like looking through the candy factory window\ldots I could see how the candy is made, but just don't get to visit the tasting room at the end of the tour. Watching my basic drivers gushing forward in a sparkling and ever-evolving dynamism was\ldots cool. The lack of affect (apart from WHOA!!!) was in retrospect disappointing.     



All in all, I think I'll stick with eating my medicine for now.
