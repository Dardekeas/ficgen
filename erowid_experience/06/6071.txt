(Sorry for my english, i live in argentina my language is spanish)



Ive been using drugs such as alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, lsd, inhalants, benzodiazepines, coke(just once), crack(just once) and some others that i dont remember.  But the point is that i have some experience and for about 4 years i'd only had one bad trip and it wasnt that bad.



Well, yesterday i was alone and sober and as i didnt have to go to school the next day i wanted to smoke some pot, watch tv and go to bed, but i couldnt do it here because my mum was here and outside was rainin like hell. So i decided to make some butter with the weed and wait to get a little high (ive done this once before and it was just perfect). I got a piece of butter (like 6cm x 3cm x 1cm)and put it in a bowl with a bit more than 3 grms of cannabis (3grms = 3 joints?), i realized that i had too much weed so i put a bit more butter and started to boil it. When the bubbles came up i hold it there for a few minutes (6 minutes maybe)and then i put it in a glass full with water to separete the weed from the butter already full of thc. i put the glass in the freezer for five minutes and when it was solid butter again i ate it with some crackers.



For 40 minutes i was perfectly normal so i thought that maybe id boiled it too much. but after 20 minutes i started to feel very hungry and i thought what? that is it? im in the come down already?, so I ate a lot until i started to feel a little high and sleepy\ldots so i was very happy that the butter had kicked in perfectly. but that wasnt it, i was gettin higher and higher every minute and i didnt like it because i was alone and i didnt have many interesting things to do. 



An hour later i went to bed to watch some tv and relax, but i knew that something was really wrong, my body was trembling a lot and my heart was really fast, i couldnt see anything because i was feeling the bed floating in the air. at this point i knew i was having a panic attack, i was so fuckin nervous cause i was lonely i didnt know what to do, so i talked to myself about what was happening and that i was having a bad experience, that everything was gonna be ok so i shouldnt worry. But the feeling was so strong\ldots 



I knew i should do somethin cause otherwise i knew i was going to scream a lot for help, and my mum would see me so fuckin stoned, and i didnt want that. so i played the guitar but every sound was so sad it wasn't working. then i looked for somebody on the net to chat with and thank god a friend of mine that lives very near was there. i could hardly use the keyboard with my hand tremblin so bad and my hurt trying to get out of my body\ldots i couldnt read very well my eyes were very fucked up. i was really ashamed of what i was going through but it was the only thing i could do, so i asked her to come over and she said it was too late (3am, 2 hours since i ate the butter), so i started to feel worse, my hole body was tremblin very very fast and i was freakin out, i told her i was havin a real hard panic attack and a paranoia feeling so she said she whould be here in 5 minutes\ldots but i couldnt wait that long, i



 went downstairs i walked all over the kitchen for a long long time tryin to calm down but that was imposibl. sudenly my friend came over and asked if i was ok, i told her how i felt but i realized that i could talk, words just wouldnt come out so i see her face and she was really scared. i drank some water, my throat was so dry and started to feel a bit normal and then i could talk so i told her everything and she told me to go to bed but i didnt want to be alone again, i knew i would freak out again, so she stayed with me for about 2 hours and i couldnt belive i was still very high (4 hours since i ate the butter)



I tried to sleep while she was here with me cause i knew it was the only way i could calm down but everytime i was fallin asleep i suddenly opened my eyes and everythin looked so wierd, i saw a lot of shadows, the tv looked so far away. i didnt like it at all, i just wanted it to go away. At 5:30am she said she should go home and i was still high, but i thought she had already done a lot, so she went and i was feeling better. i tried to sleep and some minutes later a was sleeping.



What ive learned of all this is that i had a panic attack because i didnt belive that eating cannabis was so much stronger than smoking so i wasnt warned about this, and i was alone with nothing to do that think, and my brain was thinking too fast that i coulnd haddle it. If i had to go trough this alone the hole time i think i wouldnt make it (i had a lot of suicide thoughts), so i warn you guys, eating cannabis is not the same shit that smokin it, so dont wait for a relax feelin and a few laughings, i woulnd say its a real trip like lsd, but its not too diferent.
