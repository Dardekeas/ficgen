'Ride the dragon, walk with the dragon, or lead the dragon; but never chase the dragon.'



A little bio, I am about 200 pounds, male, an also recovering addict. I have experience with several other drugs and RCs, but MDPV had really taken hold of me in the past, been a very fiendish MDPV user in the past, which always results in a horrid crash followed by days of agony and craving. 



The title says it all. MDPV is indeed the pitbull of RCs, it is all about the way I treat the drug. In the past I had binged on tan PV and slipped into a psychotic state. 



ÂºÂºÂºÂºÂº/M/D/P/V//D/E/S/C/R/I/P/T.ã1 Gramã

ãStrong semen-like smell.ã

ãConsistancy is a very oddã fluffy/crystalline white powder.

ãMDPV 15mg  insuffiated

[00:15]$>$ Euphoria is strong, but nothing like Tan MDPV

[00:30]$>$Going to use this focus to draw up a plan for me and my fiance.



[01:00] Still strongly mentally stimulated as well as physically.

[02:00]Comedown left me wanting `just one more line!!'

I'm fighting the urge, I know I won't regret that. 



â£â£â£â£â£Missionâ£â£â£â£â£â£



1âª Determine whether I can resist the urge to redose. 

/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/

âYes, DO NOT CHASE THAT EUPHORIAâ



2âªTo find a comfortable dose and intervals to redose at.

/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/

â5-10MG every 2 hours with a bottle of water for every lineâ



3âªFind a good dose to treat my ADHD with.

/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/

â15MG orally at 5AM and then at 12PM makes my job extremely pleasant with no bad side effects. I sleep at around 10PM.â



4âªMaking the comedown less dreadful.

/S/U/C/C/E/S/S/

âFollow 1 and 2â 



                      /Start

[01:00]Kick the night off with a 10mg line to get rolling, 5mg for her. Much less nasal burn, not looking forward the drip. 



--Bananas eaten-- 



[1:05]â¶Comfortably stimulated, both very talkative and. She is absorbed in her phone, I have to remind her to blink. 



[1:45]â¶Got sucked into Call of Duty, time doesn't even seem to cross my mind while I play, extremely focused.



--We both have ADHD--



[2:30]â¶Euphoria has just recently began to fade. EXTREMELY tempted to redose. The stimulation feels similar to Ritalin, better read while I still can, browsing the internet reading many other people's experiences. 



[2:50]â¶ Coming down from what I've determined to be the plateau,Desire to redose is strong for me, but I don't want to teach her bad habits, like breaking your own rules.



[2:55]â¶ Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!



[3:00]â¶10/5 MG nasal. No problem.



â¥â¡â¥APHRODISIAC!!!â¥â¡â¥



3:15$>$ I suggest we watch porn, I know exactly what this is going to lead to. Will try and take note of anything worth knowing about it effects on our sexual performance. 



+++++++++++PROs++++++++++



(M/F)Sex drive is way up,

(M)Took forever for me to cum, almost lost hope,

[4:55]â¶ H20!



[5:00]â¶She decides to put the PV away for the night to see if sleeping is plausible. 



[5:05]â¶ Desperately needed bathroom break, urine is clear but smells like MDPV.



[6:00]â¶Seems that we both are having a bit of an uncomfortable comedown, despite being physically exhausted we are mentally awake. The fiend in me keeps asking for `just a bump', I dont plan on telling her the comedown can be alleviated by redosing.



[7:30]â¶(F)She feels mentally drained and her body is restless.



[8:30]â¶ She is taking 50mg of Benadryl and few bong hits.(BHO)



[9:45]â¶ She is asleep, back down to a normal 85 BPM.



[10:30]â¶Rehydrate

[12:00]â¶I dozed off around this time
