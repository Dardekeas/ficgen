 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



About 2 years ago, when I was 13, I went to my friends house to smoke he started huffing gas he passed the can to me. I guess I didn't take a big enough huff, so about a week later I decided to give it a try cause I was board out of my mind.  



My first couple tries, I noticed at first performance enhancing (or at least it felt the way) and anesthesia, euphoria, lightheadedness. I was soon psychologically addicted. My most fucked up experience was when I took around 5-10 huffs (I think) and held each in for a while. I was standing up and suddenly a lighting bolt struck the tree in front of me (no sound from lightning just normal buzzing noise) and then the tree my and the lighting just started spinning I thought I had died and gone to hell I was preying to god to let me live suddenly I forced my self to jolt and snapped out of it. Somehow I was still standing up though. 



Also I noticed déjà vu on many gas trips I would get this thought stuck in by head that I had already done this and wondering why I was in the same place doing the same thing. Several uses after this I quit gas (thank God) and realized how fucking bad it is for me. Never will I try this again although I did love it.  My friend said that gas feels similar to dust. Most of my friends though make fun of me for doing this stupid act.
