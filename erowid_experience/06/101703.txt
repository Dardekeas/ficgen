Before this experience I was researching legal hallucinogens and was already quite fond of DXM. I heard of LSA, which can be found in legal Morning glory or Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. After hearing that it was pretty similar to LSD, I was interested to say the least.



I quickly ordered a bag of 100 HBWR seeds from a vendor in Hawaii. I was quite excited when I received them, and I wanted to consume them as soon as possible. I had read of other users reporting intense nausea or vomiting from HBWR, but I assumed that it probably wouldn't affect me much because DXM rarely made me nauseous, though most users report experiencing nausea. I decided to just wash and scrape ten HBWR seeds lightly to remove the `fuzz.' I crunched the seeds to tiny pieces in my mouth all at once, and held the pieces under my tongue for about 20 minutes, accidental swallowing a few pieces.



I sat outside and began reading a book to pass the time. After about 10 minutes, I felt somewhat strange, but I assumed it was just placebo. After about 25 minutes, I felt a strong body load and I began developing strange thought patterns. I felt drowsy, but staying awake wasn't difficult. I put on some music, but I began feeling nauseous, lightheaded, and dizzy. I attempted to stand up, but experienced painful aches in my legs. It was very difficult to stand for more than 30 seconds. I felt like I was poisoned.



I then tried to get in bed and sleep this off, but about 5 minutes after I fell asleep, a vivid and frightening dream would wake me. The intense nausea began hitting me again, so I finally walked outside and vomited. This was probably the most unpleasant vomiting session I have ever experienced. (I apologize if that's TMI) Before I vomited, I fell on my knees due to losing control of my legs. I felt quite uncomfortable throughout the entire experience. I had some interesting CEV's, a few auditory hallucinations, and daydreaming, but I was too uncomfortable to really pay attention to them. 



Moral of the story? Patience. I should have done an extraction and waited until I was in the perfect mood and setting to experience this substance. My bad experience was most likely due to my impatience and carelessness. I have not tried HBWR since, but perhaps when the time is right, I will do an extraction and responsibly take it. Good experience's are always remembered, but bad experiences usually teach you an important lesson on respecting psychoactives, especially hallucinogens.
