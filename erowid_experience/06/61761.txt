18:21 swallowed 40mg pFPP

20:00 I can feel the sight starts to lag

20:30 Smoked a joint

21:00 I'm feeling pretty good, nothing special in particular. I have some butterflies in my stomach, things tends to look soft

21:05 Swallowed another 40mg pFPP

21:14 Smoked some weed

21:17 Puts on my headphones and start to listen to trancemusic. I can feel that something strange is going on inside of me, I lay down on the couch.

21:45 I'm feeling really good, I'm getting chills from time to time from the music, the windows on the screen has become softer and the letters has a red/green glowing aura around it self. It rocks with the mothin of waves.

21:50 smokes a joint

21:54 Sometimes the letters turns into a big blur and I can't read what it says. The hair in my neck rises to heavy music. I lay myself down on the couch again.



21:56 i feel that it's easy to dream away in the music and the eyes roll back (I have no memory of writing this line)

22:38 At 22:28 I felt so damn good that I didn't even care about writing it until later on. The letters is moving more than ever before. (It feels like it was only ten minutes since my last note)

22:45 I smoke on my joint and my eyes easily rolls back when closing my eyes.

23:49 The letters is still moving on the screen and I still feel good, though the peak has passed and I'm listening to chillmusic now. I'm a bit tired

23:56 If I would have had something to make me more alert I could easily go out on a club and dance in this state of mind.

00:27 I'm going to bed. Things are still moving around
