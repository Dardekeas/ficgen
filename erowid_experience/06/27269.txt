\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:ACETAMINOPHEN\#\#



I always snort my pills, I have found that this makes the high more intense and more euphoric, but it makes the high not last as long. I started off by making my surroundings better. I dimmed the lights (better on eyes), put on techno (trippy when high), got a glass of kool aid(for drinking while I snort), and locked my door (so my parents don't walk in while I'm tripping).



I then started crushing the pills all at once, but in separate piles. I first snorted the Diazepam (valium) 4 5mg pills. I then started to feel real happy and felt real relaxed. I then snorted the codeine.

   

I then sat down in my chair and closed my eyes listening to the crazy beat. I felt so good my body was numb and relaxed. My mind did not have a thought in it. 

   

I then went back to the snorting. I always snort the oxys last they're the most intense, and make me trip balls when I'm on other things. There were 6 5mg pills. The problem with snorting these though is that there really big and ended up making like 30 or 40 lines (but I enjoy snorting so it made no difference to me). I snorted about half of it, then decided to take a break. It was about 30 min. since I started and I could feel my body and mind leaving reality. I stood up and fell and then got up and sat down. I sat there and tripped for 5 min. then started again.

   

I snorted the rest and turned on my black light. I sat down and felt like I was in another world, more like in a parallel universe. It was about an hour in and felt like I was in complete euphoria. A feeling that I've never felt in my life, and never have since. I then started getting itchy from the oxy. I then tripped for a while (not sure how long) and when I opened my eyes I couldn't remember where I was, but then I did remember so I got up to get some kool aid but couldn't get up. I couldn't feel my body at all.

   

This is when I blacked out. In the morning My mattress was on the floor, my chair on my bed frame, and made a tent out of bed sheets, windows all open(even screens), and my desk was upside down. 

    

This completely scared me away from pills. For about a week! hahaha! I am the never ending gobstopper of drugs!
