This report details the third encounter with 5-MeO-DALT as the active ingredient in a night of hedonism. 



First, some background.. I'm a reasonably seasoned psychonaut, having made use of shrooms on multiple occasions in the past, acid, 2C-E, Ketamine, Methoxetamine, AMT, 5-MeO-AMT,  and copious cannabis use, as to be expected. I've also dabbled with stims, but never had much love for them apart from 6-APB, due to its psychedelic edge.



Anyway, to the nights activities. Having received a shipmet of several chems, I made a few mixtures. Only two caps of which had the agent of choice for the night. My friends arrived about 7 o clock and we proceeded to start drinking cider. In addition to which we started on with a joint, as well as a bomb of DALT each, all about 40 mg. Our scales weren't of the best quality sadly. From there, one friend popped an etizolam as well, since he couldn't smoke any weed. 



At this point, maybe 8 pm, we went to my friends house and retrieved my large glass bong. We got waylaid there due to my friends being kind of well, easily distracted idiots. We got back about quarter to 9, another cider. And it was agreed to dose again. Smaller this time, at my insistence, with about 4 of us there since my best friend arriving. 



After another 20 mg dose each, it was time to hit the bong. Nice, as normal, with the weed we had kicking like a mule. And then my friend T, he said ``hey, lets try smoking DALT again, see if it was just our minds playing tricks on us last week or not''. This set the course for the rest of the night. 



Shrugging in resignation, I agreed to go first. Loading some ice into the bongs trap, I had them fetch me a veg knife from the kitchen, the slender pointed blade suiting my purposes best. I laid myself a small carpet of weed in the bowl, followed by about 30 mg of the mystery powder on top, since I was the first to try it on a dare the previous week. 



With everyone jeering me on, I exhaled and took the hit. Held the cooled, bizarre tasting smoke there. And a repeat of the previous test\ldots  Stronger this time. I let my eyes roll back and I got a brief, beautiful, HD vision, comparable to DMT or acid CEVs. And that my friends, was the roller coaster drop. I exhaled, coughed heavy and in turn, each friend took their hit, with a double one for myself and my best friend since it was his weed in the bongs and my chem. My friend unable to smoke weed, herein named D, took the chem by itself in the bongs bowl. He described it as harsh, but not too hot. And with that, we were all transposed to planet Xeno My walls started breathing, ceiling too. Music we had on, Acid Bath, Celtic Frost, Black Sabbath, all sounded amazing. Clear, like never before. 



Another joint, another etizolam, and then eventually, we got bored. Myself and my best friend, L, polished off the last of the 5-MeO-DALT powder. By this point I was starting to become irritable towards D, since he was acting as the nights naysayer and slow child. Awkward, for want of  better word. Turning down all suggestions for music, video etc. I was trying my best not to be too mean towards him but it was putting me and him on a bit of a negative mindset. 



It got to the point where I was asked ``so, what other chems do you have in?'' and I opened the container. It contained two caps of etaqualone by itself, two of etaqualone mixed with 5-MeO-DALT and one, the blue and white contained a stim, which I wanted to avoid. Thankfully I did, taking my dose up to around maybe 150 mg. At this point, about 4:30 am, we decided to go for a walk. Down to the river side. Leaving the house, finally, which I had first suggested after hitting the bongs. And oh gods, was it beautiful outside. The sky was a strange shade of neon blue, turning to orange in the east. 



As we walked, I noticed the incredible amount of detail life had been afforded, as well as the distortions. Glass became like planes of light where reflections hit, tracers flew, textures became almost tactile looking, even on flat surfaces. When we reached the bridge across the local river, the water below looked like a flowing black mirror, planes of dark glass moving endlessly on itself. A joint laced with a spare amount of DALT we had rolled and forgotten about previously levelled us all out, hallucinogenic smoke. Bliss. The webs of the spiders on the bridge's metal framework were like planes of fractal glass, shimmering constructs of intense beauty. We sat on a bench at the top of a rise, watching the sun coming up, lazily. With that, we agreed it was time to go home. 



I apologised to D for my short temper, since he lived on the other side of the river to the rest of us. Walking through town with T and L, we shared a few jokes, reaching the peak of the night. The visuals werent about to stop, but they both had work in the day. About 5 30 now. We said goodbye and I walked home by myself. Cleaning up my mess of cans, hiding the bong, etc. I went to bed, sleeping only for a few hours. Woke feeling totally refreshed.



All in all, a good night, and another positively charged experience, bar a few teething difficulties. I know now to be more careful with who I trip with.
