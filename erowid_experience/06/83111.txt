I had taken ecstasy (along with a whole load of others, heavily, for around 12 years so have quite some experience of these things. I had left london 3 years ago and not taken anything since then, being in a new job which I enjoy. I had read lots of positive things about this substance (not counting compulsion, which I ignored) and thought it would be a `Christmas treat' after my abstinence.



I ordered 4g in total, and finally, 48 hours later in a brief interlude of clarity, I threw the remainder down the toilet. I would otherwise have continued doing one line after another, completely driven by this chemical. My nose was bleeding, my throat was dry and sore, I had a pounding headache right at the base of my skull, but I was still being driven to `have just another line'. There is a persistant sensation that I have not quite reached the peak of the experience and `just one more line' will do it. IT WON'T!



This substance is all mink coat and no knickers, all promise and no delivery, leaving ME wanting more and more. Its like I am starting to come up on some of the best `E', but then it stalls as though I have not quite had enough to reach that peak. I NEVER WILL HAVE ENOUGH!



I'm not saying it is addictive, I certainly have no desire to ever touch the stuff again. But it is compulsive in the extreme, and once I start taking it, I am not going to stop until its all gone, and I will still not have been `really' high. I had a nose bleed and headache for three days and a depressive comedown of 5 days. The toxicity of this substance builds and builds as I chase the high I will never achieve. It is just a big letdown. My advice is stay clear of it.
