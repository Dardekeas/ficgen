It all started on a cold february night. I had been smoking dust quite frequently during the past week. PCP is by far one of the most incredibly drugs I have encountered and I have tried just about every drug there is, with experiences including various doses/combos of weed, lsd, mdma, 5meodmt, dpt, 2ct2, amt, ketamine, meth, salvia, coke, opium, amanita, 2cb, dipt, tma2, shrooms to name a few. PCP puts me in a whole nother universe, one with extremely bizarre, euphoric and meaningful states. With physical sensations I've never felt, it is as if I become one with the entire universe. I've had full blown hallucinations of a very surreal dreamlike and realistic nature within a couple of minutes after smoking. It is probably the most difficult drug experience to try and explain, impossible really. But as far as recreational/shamanistic drugs are concerned dust is at the top of the list, past exstacy or any other psychedelic.



I had smoked a blunt of some mediocre flakes with a freind of mine and was surprised to have total dust vision, but absolutely no mental effects what so ever. I was a little restless and annoyed at the fact that I wasn't even the slightest bit high. Yet everything looks like it does when I get real dusted, very puzzling. Well I'm determined to get high and then it hit me, a great idea! Make some ayahuasca, I didnt like the environment I was in and didn't care too much for the people in it either, I would rather do it at one of my boys houses or something but at the moment I didnt really feel there was much of a choice so\ldots .



Into the pot of boiling water was placed 20g mimosa, 20g harmala, cook for 15-20min and strain. I split the tea with the other kid and we both mixed it into a cup of chocolate milk (very important). Milk is key when it comes to ayahuasca, it coats the stomach and slows the absorbtion just enough to ELIMINATE the nausea completely. On a scale 1 to 10 the nausea rates at a .5 I'd say. So I drank my cup at a normal pace, could not notice a bad taste and it was only a coffee mugs worth of the tea/milk mix so I took my time just to try and avoid any possible nausea.



T-0:15 noticing first effects, Can't tell if it will be a strong experience yet but I know it will most definatly be a pleasurable one, starting to feel pretty good.



T-0:20 Coming on pretty quickly now. Minor visual effect, I burp once and that's about the extent of my GI disturbance.



T-0:30 Wow!!! Amazing trails, euphoria is skyrocketing, after this I will not be keeping track of time as that sort of task would be difficult and I don't feel like doing it anyway, why waste this great feeling. All I have to say is this is the end all be all of drugs, the omega of highs :)! It's like combining the best part of every drug without any of the negatives. This is much stronger that my last report. The visuals last time were second to the euphoria, this time they've tied. I've never seen visuals this beautiful of anything. Everything was pulsating with every color of the rainbow.

The euphoria reminded me of something. I think the pcp may have had something to do with it but I really can't say for sure, at the time I didnt recognize it because I felt the ayahuasca had overpowered it, I felt cleansed, as if all the negative substances that had been in my brain and body were flushed out. I felt purified. Dust to me goes hand in hand with summertime. I call it summer in a bottle. I had visions of being on a tropical island, I felt drawn to that like as if it was where I belonged. I felt like it was my calling, and in that state if I had the money I probably would have put myself on a plane to Hawaii. Good thing I was too high and too broke to do so. I dont think my PO would have liked the idea too much though.



The high was like being on a copius amount of exstacy but real and pure not gushing with love but more like being in a true state of grace. This is what mankind is about. I can see why the brain would have DMT in it. I definatly would not fear death I felt like this, a happy ending to the story of life. Perhapse DMT is what is responsible for unlocking the parts of the brain that give people ESP in near death experiences, perhaps in their unconscious state of tripping everthing is then truly revealed without consciousness hindering their ability to grasp the information in their subconscious\ldots or something. I was thinking something along those lines but then ignored it and forgot it as quickly as it came, I was having so much fun why waste it on trying to unlock to secrets of life and the universe.



I put on some music to see if I could amplify the euphoria which I didnt think was possible but it definatly couldnt hurt. I put on some blumchen which is german happy hardcore techno. I've listened to boards of canada before and was amazed at the euphoric audio effects ayahuasca could produce. Bumping Blumchen was no exception. Simply put, it was `breathtaking'. The music took ahold of me and my body was flowing with the music. Moving uncotrollably to every beat. It was like candy for my brain, gorgeous melodies ,intense speed, and insane acid tweaking blended together for a delight unparalled to anything. At one point I thought that the drug gave me the power to control things with my mind, again this my or may not have anything to do with the dust. I figured it couldnt hurt to try and see if telekinesis was possible. I thought that if I concentrated hard enough I could start an earthquake. Boy did I feel like a dumbass, oh well, gave it my best shot.



It was now 7am and I was still going strong, I had dosed at 10pm last night. Oh god, I'm going to be stuck like this forever. I almost didnt mind but I knew I would not be able to handle life for too long in this condition. I had responsibilities to myself and others. I tried to be social and not let it get to me but the idea was firmly planted in my mind and eventually I developed some anxiety which manifested itself into an emergency physical response. With out any warning, bllllllaaaaaaaarrrrrgggggh. I quickly spewed out the brown contents. Odd, I would have thought it would have been totally digested by that point. It was quick and painless but I fucked up my pants, good thing I had a spare pair. I tried to lay down, I didnt think it would happen again but I figured as much pleasure as I was still having it was time to try and end, just to put that thought to rest. I tried to go to sleep. I eventually got into a type of half sleep. I awoke at 9:00am still tripping pretty hard but not as intense, that was all I needed, I knew I'd be fine from that point on and soon another wave of pleasure came over my just knowing I was having one of the greatest experiences ever and I was heading toward the delightfull afterglow.



I don't think at this dosage a bad trip is even possible. It was the most intense trip ever but it was probably the most relaxed I've ever been, and given my surroundings that's saying alot for a drug. For the next 3 days I had no desire to do any drugs and if I did which I did I decided to stick to natural ones but not coke, just weed and beer and if available mescaline or shrooms. I just felt cleansed, alive, at total peace with myself and the world, and in awe of such a wonderful experience. Frm that day forward I refered to ayahusca as `hippy-juice' because I felt like a total hippy, just lovin life.
