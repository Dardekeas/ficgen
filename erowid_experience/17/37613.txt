Nutmeg was an interesting experience for me, to say the least, but I doubt I'll ever try it again.



I was 19 years old, living with a couple of housemates and taking a semester off from college to bum around.  I don't think I had a job at the time; I was living off some money I'd saved up.  At that time I really liked acid and mushrooms, and weed, of course.  Drugs made everything that I cared about more pleasurable.  And I really liked the hallucinations, I liked seeing colours and hearing strange sounds.



The night I tried nutmeg for the first (and last) time, I had been trying unsuccessfully to get my hands on some acid.  For some reason I really had a strong desire to trip that night.  Nothing panned out, but there was a full bottle of nutmeg in the cupboard.  I knew very little about nutmeg, how much to take, how long it took to take effect, how long its effects lasted, even really WHAT it might do to me.  I just wanted to trip for a few hours.  I guess I should say I knew a little about nutmeg, but really only what I'd read from William S. Burroughs' `Junky', (which I'd evidently forgotten) and what I'd heard from a couple of friends.



I thought you were supposed to mix the nutmeg with water and that the nutmeg would dissolve.  That didn't work, so I just put a few spoonfuls in my mouth and chugged it down with a lot of water.  This was at about 10 p.m. After an hour or two I noticed nothing strange, so I chugged down some more, until I had taken the entire bottle.  By this time it was getting late and I didn't really feel much different.  I decided to go over to my girlfriend's place to spend the night. (at about 1 or 2 a.m.) I figured that the idea of nutmeg as a potent drug was a joke.    



When I awoke (around 8 a.m.) I felt like I was in hell.  I had slept badly and I was told I had tossed and turned the whole night.  I was sweating like a pig and all I could smell was nutmeg.  I didn't have any `hallucinations' yet but bright lights were extremely painful.  I felt sore all over.  The worst part was that I still had to go to work!



I was when I got to work that I thought I was gonna completely lose it.  I felt extremely sick to my stomach and thought I was going to puke, but I couldn't puke, not even dry heaves.  I was sweating even more profusely and I thought everyone around me could smell the nutmeg.  I had to work the cash register but the buttons kept moving around, almost in groups.  Customers would talk to me and it sounded as if they were screaming at the top of their lungs. I felt like any second I was going to just freak out and run out of the place; either that, or just pass out.  My boss looked at me like I was insane, I'm sure I was mumbling to myself.  I kept asking her if I could go home because I felt very ill, but she said I had to stay on until things quieted down.  For some reason I knew that she knew that I wasn't `ill,' that I was `on drugs.' Eventually she took pity on me and let me go home.



When I got home I calmed down a bit.  No more customers to deal with.  I guess I can't complain too much about the rest of the `trip,' if you can call it that.  I just felt really spacey and easily distracted, kind of like being high on weed, but a more empty feeling; I guess you could say a general lack of interest, or maybe more of a FEAR of being interested in ANYTHING.  Not really a great feeling.  From what I remember I went to bed feeling pretty depressed that night.  The next morning I felt fairly OK physically and mentally, but I could still smell nutmeg, and I experienced what is probably the weirdest bowel movement of my life.



For me, it took a very long time, almost 8 hours, to have a full effect.  Of course, being impatient, I took *way* too much, especially for my body weight (which was then 120lbs. Thankfully, I weigh more now).  Myself, I wouldn't attempt to do anything `responsible' while under the influence.  Back then, I thought I could do just about anything on any drug\ldots  but nutmeg kicked my ass!  It's a hell of a lot more potent than I thought.
