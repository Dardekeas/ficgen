To begin, I have taken tramadol twice before (100 mg one time and 50 mg another). Both times I also consumed alcohol (5+ drinks) and smoked cannabis. I had terrible experiences, which was primarily characterized the following morning by excruciating headaches, nausea, and dysphoria. These are fairly common side effects (20-25\% according to RXlist.com). So needless to say, I was reluctant to try it again. I decided to up the dosage, but refrain from drinking alcohol since I've heard that it doesn't mix well.



At 6:00 pm, I consumed 150 mg of tramadol (3 - 50 mg pills). I felt no effects until approximately 7:30 (T+1.5 hrs), which did not peak until after 8:30 (T+2.5 hrs). This relatively slow onset may be a factor in why the drug is not a scheduled substance. Anyways, the subjective experience is hard to characterize. There is a clear similarity to opiates (I've tried hydrocodone and codeine). However, the drugs tendency to affect NE and 5-HT leaves an interesting effect.



Physically, I have felt slightly suppressed breathing, and my knees occasionally shook, as though my muscles felt week. My ability to stand was affected, but I was not particularly uncoordinated.



Mentally, my thoughts were not nearly as scattered and inhibited as they are when I have used alcohol/cannabis. There was a mild euphoria, but there was also a feeling, strange yet mildly pleasant, which is very difficult to describe. No hallucinations, although visual perceptions were interfered with in some subtle way.



After smoking cannabis at 10:00 pm (T+4.0 hrs), I felt naturally more euphoric. At this point, I was pretty out of my head (much more so than if I had only smoked). For the most part, it was an enjoyable experience. After 11:00 or so, my jaw started to clench very tightly. After the marijuana began to subside, the after effects of the tramadol were present. Again, interesting and hard to describe. I slept lightly, awaking frequently in the night. However, I still felt well rested in the morning. When I did wake up throughout the night, I felt pleasant and relaxed. I had no trouble getting back to sleep. 



I would not drink alcohol while using tramadol. I would smoke herb. I would not drive. I would also avoid taking it if I had serious/important matters to deal with the following day. It's a weird drug. Not mind altering, trippy, or emphatically euphoric, yet it's interesting and might be worth trying.
