 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:PACKAGED\_PRODUCTS\_VARY\#\#  



I took the whole pill which was 350mg and I felt like shit for 2 or 3 days with maybe the first 30 mins was `fun' but I'm on my 3rd day still wired and not feeling right and havent eatin nothing.



I'm drinkin alot of fluids and flush my system of this stuff. In all reality I dont see how this is a substance you can buy in a gas station by the gum in the candy isle, so dont ever do it, go with the real thing if you do, because this is so unstable and not researched. I'm scared if this will even end today I'm on my third day still wired.I went to the hospital my first day they couldnt do nothing I left after 2nd day they said just sleep it off, and dont take nothing else, and if you do, do it, dont double dose when you feel like your `losing your high' or whatever you wanna call what I experienced. Nothing like acid or coke more like someones bad idea that geeks you out and kills you faster then coke or any other illegal stimulants. I've done it all besides heroin, and I can say molly's plant food was the worse out of all of them, even smokin banana peels would of been funner then what I experienced and I've never smoked banana peels so think about that, ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS WARN PEOPLE BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS DRUG, DONT just spend your 13-16\$ on beer or something have way more fun and you get to go to sleep that day yay sleep is good.
