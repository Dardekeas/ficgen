 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 

This is what happened the first time I tried sniffing paint.

I had previously tried smoking weed and drinking beer, but thats it. 

Well on this day it was afterschool, I home alone and was bored and had no weed, or any other better drug to do. I was thinking what I had around the house that I could get high on?, I had heard of people sniffing paint, and I decided what the hell I'll give it a try, and there was several cans of spray paint in my garage I knew the gold is the one. I shook up the paint, and sprayed a good amount inside a plastic baggie. Then I put the bag to my mouth and inhaled deeply, like when I smoke weed. The smell of the fumes were strong and it was hard to breathe it in. I quickly inhaled those nasty shit fumes in and out , then felt the need to sit down so I sat down on the floor. I began to feel dizzy light headed and my body started to feel really heavy, and then I felt like I was moving in slow motion, that feeling lasted for about 30 seconds. 

I felt like I was very drunk but in a strange way. The whole thing lasted about 6 minutes. Afterwards my head and body felt hot and I didn't get a headache but I knew it was bad shit and swore I wouldn't do it anymore, but I tried it again the following day. Since the first time, I have done it about 10 times altogether.

I don't feel any addiction to it, though. The only reason I have done it is because there was no better drugs available at the time.
