Not gonna go on and on about myself other than that I'm very experienced with drugs and psychedelics, tried more things than I could remember, blah blah blah. Lot of experience with LSD, tryptamines, phenethylamines, most all that have been available anytime since the year 2000, plus some really obscure other ones never sold openly. Recently got some AL-LAD and LSZ 



T+0 Ate 5/8ths of a blotter (AL-LAD)



T+30 mins at a + 

T+1hr at a ++



T+1:20 Ate the other 3/8th blotter



Lot of visual activity with not much mental. Visuals similar to acid. More ``eyeballs'' - seems like shapes want to warp to look like eyeballs are looking at me.



Body buzz more apparent compared to LSD. I think I read someone else talk about a codeine type buzz, which is what I'm thinking.. Like there is a slight opiate fuzzy buzz in the background, along with a little jittery buzz. Not too unpleasant, not great either but it seems very mild compared to so many other drugs with their annoying body feelings (which I hate). A little nausea on the comeup (rare for me to get any at all on anything).



T+2:00 Two hours in since I ate the first piece of blotter, going good a strong ++. Maybe +++ visually but ++ mentally. Lots of visuals.. Long trails. Still, lots of eyeballs. Increased awareness of all sorts of ``oscillations'' going on in my head, bouncing all around having a strobing effect. Going to go take a bike ride outside.



T+2:40 That was a great idea! This stuff is like lime green acid. Lots of bright greens, yellows, and more organic looking / ``rounder'' curves than LSD. Riding around on a bike seems like I am somewhere tropical, like Florida beach themed colors. Hawaii. Southeast USA coast summer beach humid type feelings.



I get a similar but way different theme from mescaline. The colors and feeling I get remind me of a hot desert in the midwest, like Nevada Or Arizona. Even though I've never been in either of those states or anywhere west at all.



I think I would prefer this to acid just because the visuals are a bit deeper and I like the way colors look. Its like acid but tuned to a slightly different frequency.. Just as good though. Very clean. I keep seeing little faces or eyes looking at me from inside the LCD display as I type. 



The acid giggles are totally here. It would probably be just as hard as LSD to function around sober people. The LSD ``magic'' is fully in this, the kind that makes you think about how shitty a trip the nbome compounds are.. Or any 2c-x drug. The feeling I get after taking some proper LSD after trying the next year's round of a dozen new crappy synthetics. Its just on a slightly ``higher'' frequency (like playing a song at a slightly faster speed, making it sound a bit happier).



T+3:25 Been laying down listening to music on my phone for while. Thinking about what ``freedom'' is, and how whatever is going on in the natural world (or ``reality'') is always getting in the way of true freedom for the mind. There's always some physical limitations or annoying things in the way of freedom. Physical barriers, not enough time, not enough energy, not enough of something all the time. Whoa. No matter what there will always be something. It seemingly never ends. Fractals in my mind to the music. Good shit. 



Maybe I was wrong about lack of mental effects with AL-LAD, its more like they are there but less forceful. Very pleasant !!



I just looked on my phone to change the music, cause it seems like this has been on for a long time, and was surprised to see I'm still on the first track on a Shpongle album I thought should be ending by now. Time stretching.



T+5:45 Definitely slowly coming down.. Still tripping though.



T+6:25 Slowly on the decline.



Random thoughts: The color enhancement reminds me of 4-AcO-MiPT (which I haven't taken in like 7 years). I wonder what it is about these molecules that alters color perception like that? 



T+7:00 Almost down still some trails and color enhancement. For some reason I thought to put on Dirty Pictures (the documentary about the Shulgins).



T+8:00 Almost totally down except for the color enhancement! I could probably function as if I'm 100\% sober now.



Overall its just as good as LSD, less pushy mentally, more visuals, and better color enhancement (greens, yellows, blue-green, plant colors). Doesn't last as long which is good for me! 



I'll probably take 1.5 or 2 hits (of the 150ug stuff everyone seems to have) next time! Can't wait to compare it to LSZ.
