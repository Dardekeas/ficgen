Drug: Benedryl (diphenhydramine)

Dose: 4 regular pills and 4 ``dye-free'' pills.  

Time:  A month or so ago, ingestion began at 12:50am

Place:  The most comfortable place I know, my room.



The Trip:



After doing some pretty intense reading, I decided to glance into the old medicine cabinet, where I found some Benedryl.  I was actually looking for Dramamine, but according to the Marezine-Dramamine website, these are inherently the same, and the trip reports were pretty much equal.  So I got 8 pills, not a heave dose, but it's what I wanted to start with.



At 12:50am I ingested all 8 pills with water within the period of a minute.  I drank approximately 16oz of water.  I ate 3 hours earlier, and at the time I was not hungry.  I also ate a piece of bread, because it's just something I do whenever I take any drug.



After this I got my cd's and everything I needed for the trip ready and got my laptop on got onto my bed.  At this time it was 1:13, and I wasn't feeling anything.



At around 1:22 I felt ``something'' this is most likely anxiety though, since this is the first time I took diphenhydramine.



2 minutes later at 1:24 I feel some slight head pressure, like a sinus buildup, whether this is from the drug or just me, I'm not really sure.



1:32 I notice the walls are slightly breathing\ldotsthough again I cant really tell if this is my imagination or a drug starting to take effects.



1:39 -- I got REALLY tired, the quote from my log was.. ``shit I'm tiiired, must fight.  head kinda hurts\ldots must fight tiredness''



1:52 -- I put some music on and tried to relax with my eyes opened, which was quite hard because at this time all I wanted to do was go to sleep.  I start to feel some slight euphoria, and the head pressure went away.



2:00 -- Around not I start to notice some slight Open Eye Visuals.  I see some colors when I move my eyes looking into darkness.  Kinda the same effect I get on DXM.  I was also not nearly as tired, just kinda drowsy.



2:02- This is where it really began.  I had my headphones on, and I was talking to my friend online.  Suddenly I start to hear some rather LOUD talking through my headphones.  This slightly freaked me out for a min, cause I didn't know what it was.  Then I quickly regained my composure.  



After this everything is a little sketchy.  From what I remember is seeing the most realistic visual in my life.  I remember rolling over and looking towards window.  (I also remember being VERY heavy at the time), and when I looked over I saw this\ldotsthing.  It was kinda blobish shaped.  It was quite beautiful actually, had no symmetry at all.  Looked a little like the predator did, but had a slight purplish hint to it.  As I tried to figure out what it was, it began to move.  It moved towards me quite slowly, but at a steady pace.  Finally it was right next to my hand, then I reached out to touch it\ldots.and woke up 9 hours later.  I guess the drowsiness turned into sleep ;)



After trip:



After I woke up I was feeling heavy and hungover.  The same feeling I get from sleeping pill induced sleep.  I kinda lay there for awhile\ldotsthinking.  For the rest of the day I felt odd, not all mentally, and physically there was something different about my sense of touch\ldotsI cant really describe it.
