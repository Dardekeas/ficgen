Pre-note: This experience is with one of my best friends, A, we have done many, many drugs together and enjoy mixing drugs and having crazy nights together.



I woke up that day around noon, and had my normal `wake-up' session.

T+0:00 - 1 Bowl of very potent cannabis. (approx. 5 hits)

T+0:00 - 1 Line of generic oxycodone (approx. 30mg)



I eventually left my house and went over to my friend C's apartment. My friends J and A were there, also. My friend J had just purchased 1.5 grams of high quality, a.k.a. `Glass' or `G-Funk' as some call it here, methamphetamine. J is a very generous person and we smoked about 1/3 of his product right there.



T+2:30 - Many hits of Meth (approx 20+ hits)



We were all very spun, we sat and listened to music and talked for awhile. C needed us to leave so we walked down into this local `furnished' tunnel under a street. The tunnel had chairs and carpeting set up in it. (it was a very popular spot to do drugs)



T+5:00 - We smoked another 1/3 of his supply between 3 people. I recieved another 20+ hits of meth. After this I don't remember what we really did, except pass time doing stupid things me and my buddies do. We sat and listened to J's stories about his life (he is a homeless person and if you know any bums, they have the BEST stories.)



T+9:15 - Me and A decided to go home, as it was beginning to rain. He handed me a mini glass plate with some pills on it. He told me they were Xanax bars, but after looking at the bottle I realized they're not Xanax, they are clonzepam which is very closely related to Xanax, with a similar high.



Still feeling the meth, I crushed a 1mg pill of Clonzepam into powder, and poured it into my mouth and swallowed. If you're not familiar with this technique it is called `parachuting'. The pill hits you much much faster this way. I also was cleaning our meth pipe and smoked some of the residue inside



T+9:25 - 1mg Clonzepam ingested, 2 hits of meth taken.



T+10:00 - My friend broke our meth pipe accidentally while 

scraping it, which bummed us out. (random but relevant)



T+10:25 - We each took 5 more hits of meth (freebase), and decided to save the rest for tomorrow (J had given us some, .4g maybe)



My friend told me he had some heroin, which is both of our drug of choice. So, we started smoking heroin while on meth. Speedballing is something we do often (well often enough for that matter, it is very very bad for you)



T+10:35 - We smoked one piece (.25grams) of black tar heroin.



T+10:45 - I hadn't felt the clonzepam before, but the H brought it out. I started to get the `speedball' sweats. At this point my mind was very calm and I had an intense euphoria, yet still spun from the meth.



T+10:50 - We go outside for a smoke and to enjoy the high. It was raining and very peaceful and serene outside. At this point here is how I felt: Physically - My body was frying from the meth and was tingley and numb. Mentally - My mind was very calm, serene, and euphoric.



I was tempted to drink some Alcohol but remembered a friend who went into a coma from mixing 5 shots of vodka, 5 soma pills, and 2 lines of white thai heroin. I decided to stick to the plan of speedballing and clonzepam's for `flavor'. I have mixed these 3 before, except last time I took 6mg of clonzepam, a 10mg ambien, insufflated 20mg of oxycodone, AND smoked a decently large amount of meth and heroin. I blacked out and remember nothing at all of that day except taking 600mg of benadryl and having conversations with hallucinations in my room. I woke up on the floor with no memory of the past 36 hours. All my cigarettes and weed had been smoked somehow, and I don't remember smoking a single cig or bowl! It took me hours to even find out who I was with all day. Anyways\ldots 



T+11:25 - I decide to take another Clonzepam and also parachute this one.



T+12:35 - Still very up on meth, and very high on Heroin, with a very pleasent slowness/mellowness/calmness from the pills (which were ingested on an empty stomach). My friend was making a ductape wallet to pass time, while I was writing this report, and other poems/lyrics for fun. Just us two, high as a kite, listening to music and the night drifts away into the morning.
