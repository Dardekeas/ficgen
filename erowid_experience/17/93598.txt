So in my search to find a rc equally as amazing as methylone I've come accross pentylone and this is what I experianced. 



I started my night at 9pm with a rediculously low dose of 10mg taken orally. Waited about 45 minutes didn't feel much of anything so decided to redose this time I snorted another 10mg the feeling was very similar to a bump of coke. I was unimpressed to say the least. But after another hour I decided to try again. This time I snorted 20mg and the rush was much more noticed. Much like coke but a tad more rolly feeling. I was tempted to do more right away but refrained so that I wouldn't overdo it. So I waited about an hour and a half and decided to try dosing orally again because its my personal favorite way to dose. This time I took 30mg and the effects took about 25 minutes to become noticed but when they did I was pleasently surprized by the roll like feeling to it. As I peaked from that dose I felt it was safe to do another 30mg orally from there I was more than comfortable with my body high and head rush. 



All and all for a first impression this rc wasn't to bad. I would like to try it again and start off with a higher dose to start. I was just being careful this first time as I am everytime I try something new. But for me its for sure worth a round 2.



In low doses it produces a coke like feeling (10-30mg)

In higher doses pentylone is more of a roll (30-60mg)

Anything higher than that is a mistery to me for the moment but I'm curious enough to find out.
