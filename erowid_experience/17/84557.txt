When I was able to obtain seeds and a sample from the shrub's native region I jumped on the opportunity. During the 24 hour period leading up to this experience I only consumed very small amounts of caffeine but no other drug.



The dried pituri has a very pleasant aroma and is tan in color. There were leaves and stems in the sample I obtained.



Preparation

Ground and smoked in a tobacco pipe. 



Experience

I could tell there was nicotine and the related nicotine feeling but there was much more. I felt very light and cerebral and stimulated. I did not get the fatigue feeling I get from tobacco.  The pituri is tan in color with a very pleasant smell and taste. The ashes were white. At the end of the experience I had a bit of a headache but it was worth it. Pituri was a very pleasant and mellow cerebral smoke. I cannot believe that this herb is not more popular.
