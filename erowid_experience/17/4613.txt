[Erowid Note: The dosages described in this experience are confused and we were unable to sort out for certain what they actually meant.  We assume that they meant to say `30 grams (1 oz)', but then later they say that it sells for .76 per gram and the cost is \$4 NZ per dose.  30 x .76 is not 4.00.  Dosage information should probably be assumed to be wrong. ]



There seems to be some confusion about whether it is possible to extract any opiates from poppy seeds bought at supermarkets. I have tried this several times before and every time I have gotten some sort of high from the tea. The recipe I have been using is as follows:



Buy 300g (1 oz) [sic - 28g is about 1 ounce] of poppy seeds from the bulk food section of your local supermarket.



Mix in a bowl or pot with lemon juice. It seems to be that the more lemon juice you use the better (apart from drinking it). I fill the bowl until the lemon juice is about 1 inch above the poppy seeds.



Leave for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. 



Strain of lemon jucie. An old t-shirt works well as a strainer, but better yet is a coffee filter. Use your ingenuity.



Drink, wait about 1 - 3 hours and by then I am usually incapable of moving more than a few meters.



The high I get off this is VERY good, but have only done this 4 times, and have zero tolerance to any opiates. I find it hard to believe that even a regular opiate user will get nothing from this, but I could be (and probably am) wrong. I live in NZ, poppy seeds sell for 76c a gram over here, about \$4NZ for a 6 hour high (plus lemon juice cost). Bottled lemon juice is the easiest way to go, it costs around \$4NZ a litre, enough for 1kg of poppy seeds.



There will be a better way of doing this, but the low low cost means that I can't be bothered figuring it out. Oh, and all my friends get the same effects as I do.And you WILL feel sick off this, lying down usually stops the nausea, but if I stand up during the high I usually end up throwing up. Smoking pot mixes very well with this high (as with everything\ldots  :) 

Aparently you can rewash the seeds, but I haven't tried this.
