To me DXM (dextromethorphan) is the perfect drug.  I have used it well over thirty times and have only had a few bad experiences out of it.  I am tired of all of these people taking the Coricidin Cough and Cold and then getting sick or dying just because they wanted to swallow some pills rather than chugging a bottle of cough syrup or preforming an extraction. DXM has gotten a bad name due to this and DXM is really safe as a recreational drug if used wisely. 



I have heard also of a lot of people getting sick after ingesting DXM\ldots I have never experienced any naeusa during the trip and the only thing that makes me naeuseous is the taste of the cough syrup.  Forty-five minutes to an hour later I get a nice buzz and everthing starts to seem like it is in slow motion. After an hour or two of this heavy buzzed feeling\ldots I start to come down and it feels great because I become so creative at this point and I am happy with the world.



I know all of this sounds crazy but for me it is true and if it wasn't I wouldn't have said it.
