I just got my first job, as a fragrance rep, and it's got me nervous as hell. While I am, in many cases, hella smooth in my interactions with people, I'm also often extremely uncomfortable during said interactions. The point of this little story is, I swiped some of my dear mother's Neurontin, which she takes to help her sleep, before I went to work. (I told her I took some later; she didn't mind a bit.) I also took a 200 mg tablet of Modafinil, in case the Neurontin made me drowsy. It's just as well, because it turned out I quite mistaken regarding the average daily dose; I took 2400 mg, while the average dose is actually 900 to 1800 mg.



Everything turned out fine, though, due perhaps to the Modafinil in conjunction to my curs√®d naturally high tolerance to nearly every drug I've ever encountered. I was relaxed, confident, and (if I may say so myself) damn smooth all day long. I enjoyed myself so much that work began to feel almost like a game.
