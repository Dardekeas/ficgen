I made an extract of hops in white vinegar. What I did was take a small glass jar and fill it with hops and then pour white vinegar over it (now I know that cider vinegar is better for extracts). Then I let it sit in the sun for a few days and store the jar for at least a few months. When the extract was ready, I strained the herb out and was left with an amber-colored, bitter liquid.



The first time I tried the extract I took 2 teaspoons. I knew that hops is a relaxant so I took it before bedtime. At the time I took it I was feeling pretty anxious and jumpy, having smoked a bit of bud a few hours before and still feeling a buzzy energy. I wanted to sleep but was so full of nervous energy, I couldn't even sit still. Within 10 or 15 minutes, the hops took effect and I felt so relaxed, just absolutely free of tension and a bit sleepy, but mostly relaxed and good. I did get into bed and fall asleep and slept very deeply and easily and remembered having pleasant dreams. 



Now I use the hops extract occasionally if I have trouble getting to sleep. I only take about 1 teaspoon, and that is sufficient. I always sleep in a very relaxed, dreamy state, and I wake up with pleasant dreams and feeling good, if slightly groggy. 



I wouldn't recommend excessive use, however. Hops is a diuretic and after taking it a few days it will really flush my system, which is good occasionally. Drink plenty of water! Respect the medicines of the plant world.
