Before I start I just want to say that I was always an outgoing, extroverted kid. I was always nice to everyone and always had many close relationships with friends. I loved life as a kid. With that being said, hereâs my story.



When I was 13 my parents got divorced. I wasnât upset about it, but my siblings both went off to college the same year, I just hit puberty so I got a little emotional, and my whole life changed completely so I was a little sad about my situation. So my mom forced me to a psychiatrist who instantly prescribed me Prozac to take each day because I said I was a little âsad.â But thereâs a BIG difference between being sad and being clinically depressed. I was against it, as I knew I didnât need some foreign drug to help me. But my mom screamed at me over and over until I took it because a real âdoctorâ told her I needed it, and she just wanted to help me. So I started taking it to get my mom off my back. I had no clue what that little blue capsule was for, I was just following my moms âparenting.â



So at this time Iâm in 8th grade and I had just hit puberty. I really had no self-awareness that we have as adults, so any effect that this drug had on my mood was clearly unnoticed by me; I was just going through life. After a few months, I started to become emotionally numb. It also made me anxious, insecure, and tired all at the same time. My over-dramatic mom would argue with me and I would have very violent outbursts, often slamming doors and punching walls. Again I had no clue this was from the Prozac, it was just how I felt so I kept taking it. My mom thought it was just my rebellious nature so she took me back to the psych and he increased my dosage because I wasn't improving.



By the time Iâm 15 I had been on the medicine for 2 years now. The sex drive that I once had at 12-13 from hitting puberty is now gone. At this point Iâm so confused about life and who I am that Iâm just gliding through life like a zombie. My mom thinks my âdepressionâ isnât improving so she keeps me on the medicine and by this point taking the medicine is 2nd nature so I just take it every day. The fights my mom and I have are worse now. Im breaking things in the house and constantly yelling back at my mom. I completely fail my freshman year of high school and have no motivation for anything. I still have no clue this is from the Prozac, as my mom and the doctor insist I âneedâ it. My heart, emotions, and natural personality are slowly starting to fade.



So by the time Iâm 17 Iâm still on Prozac cause my mom sees such a great decrease in my character in me over the past few years, so she assumes that thereâs no way I can go without Prozac. Iâm in 11th grade by this point and my sex drive is completely gone, I have no personality, and Iâve been kicked out of 2 high schools. My emotion is gone, so Iâm basically a vegetable by this point, almost to the level of legal insanity. My insecurity gets so bad that I have trouble going to class. When Iâm around class mates I get so nervous and constantly worry about what other people think of me after I say something, to an extreme Iâve never ever experienced before. The only thing that calms my anxiety and makes me feel better from these horrible side effects is marijuana, so Iâm smoking massive amounts of marijuana at this point. 



By the end of my senior year Iâm 18 and have been on the Prozac for 5 years, all because my mom kept refilling the prescription over and over saying I âneedâ it. I have been kicked out of 3 schools by this point, all for smoking marijuana. In a way, I was only self medicating with the marijuana because it was the only thing that helped me cope with my Prozac-induced anxiety. At this point my social anxiety gets so bad from the Prozac that everyone around me starts to notice. I canât even have a strong conversation with someone because my brain has been so altered from this medicine. I have no self awareness on anything and the only thing I know is this feeling. So by the time I barely graduate at 18 I am basically a nothing person. I donât know how to socialize, have zero sex drive, and just have overall no emotion or confidence in anything. This is quite close to insanity in my opinion. 



I finally go off the medicine at 18 and I have no clue about anything your supposed to learn as an adolescent like basic life skills and social skills. I was in a cloud of ânothingnessâ all those years. The doctor never explained anything about Prozac to me and my mom kept giving it to me with such great energy so I just kept taking it. Itâs a very sneaky drug, it makes you feel completely different but it feels natural. Thatâs why people kill themselves on it: because they donât realize itâs the drug making them feel that way, its just how they feel. 



From age 18-21 I literally had no clue who I was. I had no friends and really didnât know how to do anything. And the only thing that made me feel normal was illegal drugs or more anti depressantsâ¦ I feel my brain had almost chemically become a drug addictâ¦ One more thing: Prozac also stunted my pubertal growth. I didnât grow one inch during puberty while on Prozac, so I am basically stuck in a 13 year olds body. My whole family is tall, except for me. I canât prove this but studies are just now coming out saying it stunts growth in children and it all makes sense why I didnât grow.



So now Iâm 21 and Iâm just now starting to get my sex drive back along with some emotion. I have major difficulty socializing and holding a job. And the worst part about this whole experience is I didnât realize that ANY of this was going on until about a few months ago. I was just going through high school regardless of how I felt. I didnât know anything about fluoxetine and how it affected my mood/behavior so I just took it everyday as prescribed. These antidepressants really mess with your head way worse than 99\% of all illegal drugs. With drugs like LSD and marijuana, I only have experiences that enhance my life and the lives of others. But with SSRIâs, they do something different. They change who you are. Some people need these meds, but if you donât need them and you take them they will probably screw you up.



The best way for me to explain my situation is the snowball effect. Before I went on antidepressants, my life issues were a small snowball. When I was put on the meds, my issues/the snowball started going downhill and the snowball/my issues only got bigger. The longer I was on the meds the bigger my issues got. By the time I got to the bottom of the hill, which is the end of my pubety at 18, I am stuck with a massive snowball of mental issues that might take years to recover from.
