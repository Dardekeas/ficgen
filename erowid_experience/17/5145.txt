im a regular user of drugs and i've always experimented with diffenet things and i have figured out some drug stacks that work pretty good i just wanted to let some others know so im emailing them to you, here they are:



Natural Test  Experiment.



Two test subjects with full stomaches.



Stack consists of: 

generic metabolifes, Kava Kava', St John's Wart, . and nutmeg.



Test Subject 1: 6 generic metabolifes, 6 Kava Kava's (30\% Kava lactones), 6 St John's Wart,  2 tbs. of nutmeg.



this stack basically i found and others who took it basically last about 10hrs and about 3 hrs of peaking, 



Postive effects: it makes you feel happy, in a good mood, motivated to have progress in what ever you do, extreme alertness, raises your confidence, and overall give u a content feeling\ldots 



Netitive effects that may occur: Heart beats fast, inability to sleep, possably stomache ache\ldots 



Here is another, i consider this stack to have better effects than  most all drugs!



Fironal or generic brand (butalbital) 6-8 pills, and metablife or generic version 6-8 pills\ldots 



These two need to be togeather in order to work good.. its last about 4-5 hrs



This stack gave me and others who tried it the following: 



Positive: Extremely confident in what ever you do, great mood, very happy, open to do anything ( you may find yourself talking to everyone you see ), give the body a relaxed feeling.



Negitives that may occur: nose may be run, have to urine frequently, depression after coming down, also firional is very addictive\ldots 

\end{document}
