I weigh around 230 plus or minus a few and stand about 5' 8'. This is my second time using Kratom the first time I consumed 5 grams of what was said to be 15X extract, with no results. This experience was much better.

 

Roughly 9 grams of Thai Kratom powder was placed into an espresso / cappuccino machine. Because the water is heated to such a degree I thought this would be perfect, and it was. I ran three of the small coffee pots of water through. The first run came out looking like apple cider. The second looked like tea. And the third like a pale beer. I then mixed and drank all three within 5-10 minutes after they cooled. The `tea' tasted like very strong regular old tea. I then sat down at my drawing table to finish a picture. No immediate effects were noticed. 



One hour in, I have been feeling quite good for some time now, and have grown bored of drawing. I take a minute to look over the two drawings and feel totally amazed at what I have done, better than I should feel. Now what to do\ldots  My brain feels numb like I'm wasted drunk with absolutely no negative side effects. Also ordinary things seem extraordinary. I decide to get online and play a little Texas holdem. Wow the computer is an amazing thing! I lose at holdem. Losing didn't aggravate me but it would have felt great to win , really great. I then return to drawing.



Four hours later I still feel a little something. I feel very good. I feel as though Kratom is going to help me quit getting drunk so often and be more productive.



Next time I will use more than 9 gramsm
