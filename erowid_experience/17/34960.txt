I've been using Skelaxin sparingly to help with chronic leg and muscle pains. My previous use of Skelaxin had been generally uneventful and untherapeutic, even when used in conjunction with a small amount of alcohol (which seems to totally relax the painful muscle contractions).



Under extreme discomfort and multiple regions of pain, (a very sore arm and the reoccurring leg pains) I decided to take four 800mg pills. Dosages previously had been between two or three of the pills with very limited effects.



After squirming around for a couple hours, I finally got to sleep. The Skelaxin only seemed to produce its usual subtle sedation for the two hours I remained awake that night. The next morning I awoke feeling extremely hungover and dehydrated. I was very hot and uncomfortable, even when I returned to bed.



My apetite was destroyed by the uneasy stomach and lack of energy I had. I thought a bit of Cannabis would help me get back to a comfortable level of sedation. Instead, the anxiety and irritability of the Skelaxin increased dramatically. Some of the bodily discomfort was relieved, but confusion and delirium set in. I had an extremely hard time reading simple text - I couldn't keep my attention on anything.



I decided that a warm bath might help, so I smoked the rest of the Cannabis and slipped into the bath. My muscles became wildly relaxed, but I was still in a great deal of discomfort. My head felt warm and my breathing was somewhat erratic, fading in rhythm and returning in anxious waves.



While in the bathtub, I was overcome with a great deal of irritability and anxiety. I felt like I was stuck under a great rock, unable to move without great effort and discomfort. The mild OEVs that marijuana usually produces in my relaxed state became greatly exaggerated - resembling patterns seen while under the effects of psilocybin; minus the heavy distortion of perspective.



After some rest and some stretching, I began to regain my strength over the day. I can definitely say that the unpleasant effects lasted until around 9 P.M. the night after I took the dose. This put me at approximately the T+ 20hr mark.



In some ways, this reminded me of my awful experiences with amitryptaline - feeling like a zombie all the next day after dosing.



I must say, the effects of Cannabis have never been so wildly pronounced without interference from other, stronger psychedelics.  I'm glad to be at a point now where I don't feel like collapsing! Not a recommended experience by any means.
