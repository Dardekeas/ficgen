 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



I felt most reports on duster were fairly anecdotal. My experience varied alitle from the norm and I feel compelled to express the magnitude of the feelings as best I can.



Ahh computer duster. Is there a more vile inhalent out there? I am a 19 year old with a rather dedicated drug using hobbie. I ussually enjoy all types of drugs and have tried may. Apart from habitualy weed smoking,I've dipped into opiates maybe half a dozen times, tripped off of DXM for solid months, eaten large quantities of benadryl and delved into the world of trytamines (It-190 and LSA mostly with sporadic journies to the Shroom God and Acid Lady). I can basiccally hold my brain together more-or-less while high. When I saw you could get high off of computer duster I was instantly intrigued.



The taste was sweet, the lungs felt cool (temperaturewise) for a second and then numb. I held my breath for a good 10 seconds before the buzz from hell came on. Massive tinitus struck me as my thoughts increasingly braked to a holt. I exhaled 45 seconds later and my breath felt funny, almost like my lungs were a bottle of nail polish remover. The buzz just kept hitting harder until about a minute in, were things plateaued for a little bit.



The space I was trapped in went by like hours. I thouhgt I was DEAD. I felt like I was one with the universe, but in a bad way. Very Sinister. I was an insignifgant speck that was doomed to view the universe from afar for eons until everything implodes on itself, at which point there will be blackness, but still a concious mind. When I mentally hit the blackness I kept counting to 3 in beat with my tinitus and feeling doomed because the universal language of math was stunted at 3 and therefore reality was put into suspended animation.



I felt out of phase, almost like my soul was escaping, but the grip of life was too strong. After coming down all I thought about was how interestingly weird the whole thing was, so I thought another hit wouldn't hurt, another HUGE hit. HUGE mistake, back into the void I leaped. Scared and far from my home I vowed never to touch this gas again.



It made me sick afterwards and the symptoms after contemplation felt inseperable from nerve damage. I felt dazed like when you get punched in the head real hard, thats the best way I cuould explain head buzz during the come up and comedown. The plateau is being kocked uncouncious. Inhalents suck. The interesting thouhgt pattern and insights were abolished and forgotten by what I felt as an overall toxicity. I honestly felt DEAD. BEWARE!
