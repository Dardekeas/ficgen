I've been on Effexor XR for around two years. I've read many reports and have disucssed much of it with doctors and other persons who've also taken the medication. The verdict is a mixed one for most people; stories of withdrawl commonly heard or suicidal mania comes to mind when you hear of Effexor and other SSRI/SNRI's in general. 



I began taking Effexor for depression(I would hardly agree that it doesn't do much for G.A.D., however many doctors are reluctant to prescribe anti-anxiety drugs that actually work(due to abuse). It helps depression minorly or majorly depending on the dose and user. I started at a dose of 37.5MG I was eventually raised up to 225MG last month, and soon after taking the dose decided to taper off. 



I did observe some unexplained manic feelings, but if this was due to the medication is unlikely. I don't think medications are to blame for behavior in any way. I didn't decide to go with Effexor, and have since decided to go on Wellbutrin, a more stimulant type of anti-depressant.
