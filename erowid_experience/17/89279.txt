\#\#EROWID\_NOTE:PACKAGED\_PRODUCTS\_VARY\#\#



As a first time user I was unsure what to expect. I had purchased the drugs under the guise of bath salts, knowing the chemical composition of it through a friend who is a chemist who had found it after hearing reports of ivory wave come out of the UK. Now I completely understand peoples apprehension with research chemicals, and I am the same way, not trusting anything that has not been extensivey tested. Well, my chemist friend had done extra research and had taken it upon himself to try it first and compared the experienced with a really strong adderall.



(approx. 7am, day 1) while I am not norally a fan of stimulants, I felt compelled to give it a try. Tracking it down was much easier than expected. Using the same 250mg package as my friend (purchased from a local gas station) and same brand I arrived home and decided to start with a very small line to assess the strength. Within 5 minutes I noticed a vast difference in my alertness and energy, motivation, and concentration. Music, especially techno and punk, seemed to be the only thing I could focus on.



(approx 10pm day 1) My muscles are starting to get sore for no real reason. I attribute this to the constant fidgiting I have been doing due to inability to sit still (practical blizzard outside), my skin is also rather flushed and warm, and I find myself taking freqent trips to the toilet to urinate (assuming this is the bodies natural reaction to the addition of anhydrous salts) but make no note to drink water. My body and mind are slowing down rapidly and I've developed a sight headache due in part to my teeth clenching. I decide to redose with a larger line.



(approx 4am-730am day 2) the time of day finally hits me and I realize I have reorganized just about everything in my bedroom, and that I have to be at work in 2 hours. I decided to shower and notice faint red splotches on my arms and legs, paying these no mind I compulsively scrubbed everything to a point I didn't think possible (nearly bleeding spots of raw skin on my abdomen). At that point one of my roommates had started to pound on the door, I had been in the shower for over an hour. I decided to leave early to grab lunch from the local buffet, after neatly arranging the bacon on my plate and ensuring the cream cheese was spread as evenly as possible on the bagel, I took one bite and realized I was instantly nausious. I thought this a little wierd, but carried on to work, doing a bump in the parking lot before going in. The nausea subsided while I was doing my morning routine of smoking a cigarette before the morning paperwork. I then steered clear of the white powder for the rest of the work day.  



(approx 5pm-10pm day 2) finally off work, I found myself easily agitated by my roommates, and had a nagging feeling (urge) that the powder could cure my anxiety and anger. I had cut myself a rather large line and suddenly felt amazing, was extremely focused and was no longed angry at my roomates and decided to put on an advanced copy of the latest cage the elephant album and listened to it three times back to back without losing interest which is rare for me. I had chalked it up to my severe liking of the band rather than the chemical enhancement.



(approx 11pm-6am days 2 and 3) The line from earlier had worn off at around 11, and being yet not tired I figred I would do another bump to keep me awake for another hour or so. This bump had me back into the stratosphere of intense focus and motivation. Despite the fact that I was up for almost two days at this point I was far from exhasted both mentally or physically, in fact I had never been so energetic after such a long haul. So, using my typical insomnia as an excuse for my being awake at such odd hours I walked around my building chain smoking between the hours of 330am and 5am. I then realized again how late it had come to be, again hopped in the shower and continued my typical morning routine, then proptley left for work at 6.



(6am-12pm day 3) The emotional effects of being awake for 48 hours plus start taking their toll on me. I am unable to focus on even the simplest aspects of my new position as a section head. The stress that existed not only at work but at home had taken a toll on me in my exhausted state. I decided that a trip out of the shop was in order, so I had loaded up some things that needed to go to fedex to be shipped across the country to our business partners on the west coast. While on the trip to the shipping warehose I had decided maybe a little bump was in order, so I had managed to sneak in a small keyhole bump behind my assistants back. Apparently this was a bad idea because it had not only failed to mitigate my stress, it had amplified it to the point of near mental collapse, I had managed to keep it together until lunch though.



(12pm-12am Day 3) This entire period was not much more than a blur. I remember having a slight mental breakdown due to the stressors I had encontered at work at around 1pm, dealing with a newly broken family structure, and for the first time in years I had broken down and cried\ldots  in my bosses office. He had felt bad at my, then unknown to him, relapse of insomnia and sent me home for the rest of the day. I vaguely remember helping my roommate clean our apartment, redosing and still not sleeping. My mind, still recoiling in horror from being abused and kept awake against its will for so long, had started producing both scary and hilarious hallucinations to which I found the powder to help drown out due to my extreme focus.



(1am-12pm Day 4) Still awake, petrified at what I see in the mirror. My skin is clamy and grey, my hands have turned a shade of greyish blue, my heart is racing, my extremities are cold but my head feels like I'm burning up. I begin to worry and start looking up these symptoms online and turn up many different answers. Histotoxic hypoxia, Serotonin Syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, and mild Metabolic acidosis seemed to be what I was experiencing at this point, noting that at 430am I had completely finished the first bag of 250mg. After forcing myself to eat the first meal in 4 days and drink water which I had been foolishly neglecting for the days prior and a nice electrolyte rich drink (V8 and Gatorade) those symptoms began to vanish.



(1pm-330am Days 4 and 5) The withdrawl symptoms were mild and ranged from cold sweats to slight natural insomnia, these were easily kept in line with very small bumps over the period of 1pm-9pm, and was able to finally get some form of sleep while on the road to Pennsylvania.



As a side note I have always been hyper sensitive to stimulants save caffeine (used to work at a gas station drinking 7-10 pots of dark roast a night). I hope this has shed some light on the subject for any wanting to track it down and try it. My experience was from the brand cloud 9 in the silver and white bags, they see to be the same composition. Given my experience I would do it again, just not in a binging manner.
