 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 

My parents brought home a package of three Dust-off containers a couple of weeks ago. They had purchased them from COSTCO (wholesale store), but I hear you can purchase them at any computer store at a jacked up price. When i first saw them i read the container. `Inhalant abuse is illegal', `abuse may result in death or imprisonment'. I wanted to try this product and at the time i could not find any information that proved me wrong. I knew inhalants were bad for you but I loved nitrous and hoped it was similar. 

When my parents had go to sleep one night and my sister was out of the house, I took the first container out of the package. I took 1 small breath at first and it was sorta like a head rush. I decided to push the button down a litte more the next time and it was really like a MEGA strong rush. I decided to do it one more time for the night. I inhaled 3 large breaths. The next thing i remeber was an extream buzzing noise followed by a closed-eye hallucination (which will prove to be a re-occuring one.) In this Hallucination I can't remember it perfectly even three min after the experience. there are three people two are up top (above water) and I (I think its me) is under water, the first couple of time I dive down its okay. I come back up and the two people tell me to try for longer (longer under water) so i dive down further than even where i panic. I cant get any air. I hear calling. He says `what's wrong?' (i dunno how i can hear him under water but it is just that way) He says `remember the signals, whats going on down there' i cant remember what the signals are so i yell and scream. 

the next thing i know i awake staring at my TV screen. I had passed out. I felt relaxed, as if i had been asleep for days. My sister pulled into the drive and i ran to my room with the can in hand. I went to sleep. In the morning my parents had gone out and my sister was still asleep so i inhaled about 3 long breaths again. But i was standing up. I passed out and fell to the floor cutting myself in many places. I had the same hallucination again and when i woke up my sister was banging on the door. I had fallen in front of it. I later found out she was about to phone the police. 

I stopped doing it now because of re-occuring hallucinations every time i take more than one breath. I would not recommend this to anyone. Or any inhalent other than Nitrous. But thats my opinion. No matter what you do be careful!
