I've been taking LSD for 15 Years now!



So far nothing bad, good trips mostly a few panic attacks throught it, sometimes maybe getting to close to things that are beyond me, places I am not ready for.



My partner has been taking for 10 years or so (since we got together), no problems either. Doses from 1 to 6 tabs (paper) no idea of quantity in tabs, best were little flint like microdots, looked like lighter flints, very powerfull awesome trips.



All I can say is after 15 years I have had no problems that I know of, Consumed Speed for some time also, not very good in longer times, Teeth rot! Insides not so good. Stay away from speed for long time use, my advice.  Acid no probs at all, mushrooms nice trip maybe 4 hours! Try making paste from them boil in water down to resin like syrup and dry out on paper 1 inch squares work well different trip from just making tea!



Certainly I understand thing better for my experiences Knowledge of High end physics is beyond most, The ability to see / imagine in new ways is main benefit never saw anything that looked real, ie halucination though some see through apparitions, like transparent holograms!



My advice give it a try with people and place you are comfortable in, maybe watch a good comedy light hearted at start to put you  in good mood!



Stevie
