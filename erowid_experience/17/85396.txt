[Erowid Note: `Bath salts' and similar products generally do not list ingredients or dosage on their packaging. Analysis has revealed that ingredients in a single product of this type may vary over time.]  



I bought 0.5g of StarDust Extreme from a UK head shop the other day. When I tipped it out it looked light and slightly crystally. I was unsure of how much to take or what to expect, because after 2 weeks of solid searching on the net I found no reviews, experiences or information of any kind on this product. So I decided to cut myself a small line of about 30-40mg to see what this stuff was like. It went down smooth and didn't have a very strong scent at all. Which from my experience with party powders and `bath salts' is a good thing, because sometimes the things manufacturers add to make it smell and taste nice can actually make it unpleasant to take. As a result, the nasal drip from this stuff was better than similar products which tend to make me gag, but this was ok.



I sat there for about 10 minutes and waited for it to kick in. I wasn't feeling anything at this point. So I gave up and went to sit down and watch tv. As I entered the living room I started to feel a weird buzzy feeling in my stomach, which I thought nothing of. Over the next 10-20 minutes the feelings got stronger and my heart rate increased. But it was so subtle and gradual that I hadn't really noticed how it was effecting me, until I decided to phone my Dad! As soon as he answered I suddenly found myself with a million things to say, which is unusual because I'm a very quiet, shy person. With this new found confidence we chatted away for 5 minutes, then out of nowhere I was hit with a pleasant rush all over. I suddenly realized that I was as high as a kite and feeling happy, chatty and slightly euphoric. For a moment I panicked over one thought, `what if Dad notices I'm on something'. Because as far as he knows I stopped taking drugs (legal or otherwise) when I left home 6 years ago. Which I had done, until last year when I decided to try some of the latest generation of legal highs. We chatted some more and I began to calm down. 



After talking to my Dad I found myself sitting in front of the tv and just staring into space, with some wonderful euphoric, heart racing buzzy feelings. So I thought I might as well do something useful with my time while I was buzzing. I finally decided to go on the computer and write a review of a different legal high I bought the week before. So I got writing. Before I knew it an hour and a half had disappeared and I had written well over 500 words. Making, I thought, some very interesting and informative points. Looking back I think I was just waffling and writing down the first thing that came in to my head. Suffice to say, they didn't accept my review, far too long probably.



Time seemed to just disappear as I was sitting in front of my pc. Before I knew it another 2 hours had gone by and I was feeling great. I ended up spending the rest of time doing the cleaning. I would say the high lasts a good 5-6 hours. When I came down I slept soundly and had no ill effects in the morning.



I think I will do this again, but only as a once in a while thing. It's not the kind of thing I want to get addicted to.
