 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SUBSTANCE\_ID\_QUESTION\#\# 



I am a college student who is an experienced drug user. I smoke marijuana on a daily basis and party any time I want, although usually only on the weekends. I recreationally am open to do just about any drug and have tried a large handful available to me on the street today. My favorites are DXM, Nitrous, and marijuana, but I have done many opiates, amphetamines, antidepressants, cocaine, molly, absinthe, sleeping medicine (fought Seroquel to feel high), K2 and the other synthetic cannabinoids, also kratom, nitrous, Dimenhydrinate and others.  



Enough background info\ldots



I was heading home for the fall break, and I was preparing to go to an outside rave festival in Maryland, not farther than an hour from my house. My friends and I were going to go and have good time, taking whatever drugs, then having a campout and a fire. But before I came home one of my close friends pick up 2 ounces of Molly, or powdered MDMA. 2 oz of Molly is a LARGE amount, and is usually purchased for distribution, as it is sold in .1 grams increments, not 1 gram like weed. He planned on selling it and taking it, just having an all-round good time.  



We left at around 5:30, and smoked a joint on the way there, getting lost in the process. When we got to the concert I immediately bought some from my friend and took .15g at 7:00. I was handed a red solo cup filled with the substance and just dropped all the crystals in my mouth, then washing with Gatorade. It was one of the worst tasting things I have ever tried, after Molly (which you will find out later the drug I took isn't) and the bitterant added to air duster.  After ingesting the ``molly,'' I was passed a bowl of weed and had a 30 min toke sesh with some friends we met, that were from my area. It started to get dark and cold, but we were all happy and mingling with the friendly people that attend raves and I was peaceful. 



When walking around I was feeling euphoric, but I knew I was going to be doing more because as I stated earlier I use drugs frequently and generally don't ``freak out'' when taking large doses of things. I go hard one might say\ldotswell anyway I continued to smoke more weed, but I was most concerned about taking more molly. Right at that moment I was just feeling like my body was light and euphoric, but my thoughts were controlled and actually sped up, but I was as sharp as ever, weed smoking aside. So I took .2 G weighed by my friend, who claims it was over, by .02. Soon I was feeling good as hell and my body was going through amazing euphoric journeys, while my mind was on the earth. But I did start to notice something about myself and others around who had also ingested the drug. We were all talking really fast and energetically, like each of us had a really important point we had to get across right at that moment. But all was well and we were having a good time. 



Later my friend was making a sale and a medic asks to take a look at what he had for sale. She took one look at the bag and said you are selling meth. I was wondering why the large bag my friend had was filled with glass like shards, not the brownish moon rocks I was used to. My first reaction to the allegations was to think about how I felt and I was like ``wow this is what meth feels like? No wonder people do it all the time and get addicted,'' because I had never tried meth before. But after the test kit was whipped out, and the drug tested, it was concluded that the drug was Butylone, not meth. So since I felt good already, I took .1g more because my friend offered to give it to me for free, since he was ripped off and sorry for the confusion. 



The only adverse effects I felt besides cotton mouth was my heart seemed to race as if I was on cocaine or another stimulant, but this could have been predicted as the drug is related to MDMA, a stimulant, with the same heart energizing effects. The whole time I was on the drug I would have never guess it wasn't molly until the person suggested it wasn't. I had an amazing time and I even think it is better and more powerful then molly, having similar effects, and side effects. 



I stayed up all night on it, never really getting tired, and was very parched after I started coming down on it. It gave me incredible cotton mouth, like I have never experienced on weed or even extacy/molly. I had no bad feelings after coming down, although I was not really hungry until hours after I had come down, eating only an apple in a 20 hour timespan, from 7 pm to 3 pm the next day. This could have been due to me eating a large portion of steak before ingesting all the MBDB, and I wasn't hungry even though I smoked weed about every half hour at the fest. 



I really don't know what times I took the drug throughout the night, and was constantly smoking weed and doing nitrous balloons so I am not sure how effective this experience is in the butylone category, but from what I remember I had an amazing time with little to no after effects. I even think it is a better substitute than molly, although this drug is still experimental and not much is known about it. But I accidentally ingested it and am not regretting it, luckily, as my friend could have actually gotten meth and gotten me addicted without knowing or meaning to. It turns out his dealer actually thought it was molly also and was sold this fake stuff as molly. But I dodged a bullet and had a great time in the process hopefully this gets posted and helps somebody out. 



P.S. I took a large dose compared to others who had tried this drug and I suggest not doing as much as I did, if any at all, because there is still risks involved, but have fun and cheers :)
