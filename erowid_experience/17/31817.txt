Just thought I'd share my morphine experience from when I was a narcotic addict\ldots  I bought two sixty milligram morphine sustained release tablets and two fifteen milligram morphine immediate release tablets for \$25 on Christmas day in 1999. I had been addicted to painkillers for two years, so I was extremely stoked to get my hands on so much morphine. 



I took one IR 15mg. tab, expecting to get floored\ldots two hours later, nothing. I then broke up the SR 60mg, and took half. A slight buzz in an hour. I thought, `what the hell, this isn't working,' and took the rest. Whoa, damn! That definitely did the trick! It came on stronger and stronger, and I thought I had unwittingly taken a lethal dose. It finally plateaued at around four hours, but by that point I could hardly move or speak. My family must have wondered what the hell was going on, as I took five minutes to lift each fork-full of Christmas dinner to my drooling, slurring mouth\ldots Hell, I wasn't hungry at all, but, at the same time, a plateful of shit would have been the best meal I had ever eaten because I was so high.



So, I experienced that blissful feeling for a good two days, and I wished it would never end. I can honestly say that morphine is the best of the pure opiate agonists - the euphoria is better than cocaine, sex, or skydiving. I once tried Pediagoric (tincture of opium), and a half a bottle of it was very similar.



However, it is dangerous, and it is extremely unwise to ingest that much morphine at once, unless you have a serious tolerance (I'm not talking 5-6 Percocets a day; more like 50-60\ldots  and Lortabs are candy for schoolkids\ldots ), a death wish, or a sitter who has IV Narcan and knows how to use it when you stop breathing. It also helps to get a narcotic dosage conversion table, which can be found in The Merck Manual or The Physician's Desk Reference.



Just for the record, right before I took those pills, I injected IV, two bags of what a then- `chipper' friend called `really good heroin\ldots ' I felt absolutely nothing, and he passed out off of one bag (He later died of an O.D. in a Krystal restaurant bathroom near Georgia Tech - opiates can kill you!). So, I cannot say it enough -  just go burn a doob \ldots  it is much safer and a lot more fun in the long run\ldots
