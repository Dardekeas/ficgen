The setup:    I'm on 20 mg per day of Paxil (an SSRI).  I'm an experienced MDMA user, but with no use of any sort of (recreational) drug for nearly a year.



On the spur of the moment, I obtained two 100 mg. MDMA gelcaps.  Both were taken with milk, 20 minutes apart.  This dose (about 2 mg/kg) would normally have been a put-me-on-my-ass roll, but this time (the first time I've tried MDMA since being put on Paxil) was wholly unremarkeable.  I would rate the effects as being on par with somewhat less then half of what I had actually taken\ldots relaxed and a little energetic, but little else.  As usual after MDMA I slept lightly, but there was little `hangover' the next day.



If I were to repeat the experiment, I might pre-load with 5-HTP, take more MDMA (it was all I had), and/or go off the Paxil for a day or two (with the warning that I'm perfectly prepared to deal with potential unpleasentness like withdrawal.)



Speaking from experience, SSRIs seem to be quite effective at supressing the desire to use MDMA.  It was mainly boredom that brought me to try it again.
