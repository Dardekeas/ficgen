 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:ETHER\_FROM\_STARTER\_FLUID\#\# 



It was a typical Friday morning and I woke up around 9AM.  I didn't have school and work wasn't until 4 so I decided the best thing for me was a little ether to get me going (it is starting fluid after all). I was quite relaxed and worry free, mostly wanting to a bit of self exploration.  I did the well documented but ineffective water method because I feel it is easier to use in a non-aerosol form, preferring to suck up the top layer with an oral syringe left over from a surgery.  I got about 35ml of starting fluid from the first go and squirted about a third of it onto a bit of towel I had ripped off.  I sat down on a desk in my garage and inhaled deeply through my nose.  At first the smell was a bit overpowering but I pushed forth, undeterred.  



After about 3 huffs I was starting to fell a little ``funny'' and continued on, reapplying the remainder of the syringe full within 7 minutes.  During those 7 minutes I noticed the buzzing of the fluorescent lighting above me beginning to echo and sound a bit like a toy train bell I had as a kid.  I didn't quite realize how affected I was until I stopped huffing.  I stood in the same spot for about 10 minutes without even noticing time pass, and I will do my best to describe to you what happened in those moments.



I stood up from the desk, which happened to actually be from my kindergarten classroom, and I thought I was back in my old school, which I haven't visited for 5 years or more.  Nothing really looked like the school but it felt like I was there anyway.  Then I walked over to the workbench and stared at this piece of wood trim which triggered something from my distant childhood.  I was struck by a memory of my dad saying ``Your mom is not supposed to be home till\ldots `' then he would lock up like an old video game and turn away, only to restart the same statement over and over.  This had to go on for only a minute but it seemed like a long time.  Next, I came to and turned away from the workbench and started thinking about when I had heard my dad say that.  I looked inside of myself and started to think about why I got high.  It felt like I was supposed to figure something out so I set off into my mind and  looked for an answer.  After several minutes of thinking and eventually returning to the same point I started at, I became confused and decided to have a cigarette. 



After the cigarette I felt like I was coming down but I had told myself I wasn't going to do anymore ether today.  That willpower lasted for about 30 seconds as I fixed up about 20ml more and started huffing again.  When that was over, my brain wanted more but my lungs said ``Hell no'' so I walked (I wish to think it was walking) to the stairs and listened for sounds of anyone who may have come home. I only heard the Science Channel but it sounded really strange.  Everything was echoing very badly and while I could understand what they were saying, it seemed like some strange language to me.  I could only imagine if anyone had been there to talk to me what I would have sounded like.



I watched a bit if TV (something about Bigfoot I do believe) for probably 20 minutes and took a shower.  By that time I had almost completely come down off of my amazing train ride.  I went to work at 4 and I was feeling fine, my reflexes were off quite a bit and my lungs felt funny.  Over 24 hours later I was hanging out with my woman and she said I smelled like a dry erase marker.  No matter what I do, I smell for quite a while.   



I have done ether once since then and had much of the same trip, only I had almost found the answer that time.  I think the answer was that I can't find the real answer getting high on ether.  Overall, it was quite a pleasant experience, even if my lungs don't feel right for about a day afterwards and I smell like a gas station.  I hope to someday experience this with friends and see how interesting things get.  Thank you for reading my experience.
