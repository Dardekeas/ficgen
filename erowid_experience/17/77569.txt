I'm an ex-pothead, and have recently been trying out legal highs. I have smoked spice silver, gold and diamond, as well as sence, exses, london underground dream and more. 



This, `Smoke' stuff is advertised as the best of them all. Some London underground dream is with the smoke as well. I had to wait a long time for them to arrive as they had to be treated by customs here in Australia. More money! 



So I had been smoking sence a couple of days and my tolerance was up. I expected the smoke to get me really smashed again. The stuff looks alots better than sence. It looks like spice. So I had one bowl of smoke I felt a light buzz. The smoke is really harsh. So I mixed the smoke with the underground dream and had four more bowls. I felt a mild buzz for about half an hour.



This was less effect than if I had of kept smoking Sence. So I don't reccommend smoke or London undergroud dream. I'll stick to spice, exses, yucatan fire and sence, these definately do the job.
