The methoxy is turning out to quite the fox indeed. After skirting around the fence for awhile I finally found my sweet spot. Plugged in, jacked up, erotically aroused. Ohhhhh boy



I should have known this would happen. ;)



We tried the lower expression, 6mg for a day in town and found it to be pleasantly subtle, but needing the assistance of a little cannabis and GHB for proper movie preparation. 



Now it's a holiday I say so why not crank up the music a notch. Slipping 14mg under my tounge, the indole numb, the shiver, the recognition of state.



Coming on faster stronger than before, its obvious were going places today baby. At T+1 I'm moving dancing and letting things soak and settle in. Wow! the sweet spot indeed. Much more developed as you go along. Enjoying the rich tapestry of music as I write, I feel it through my finger tips and into my feet. Let the methoxy move. 



Now at T+2 things are strong yet I feel I could maintain physical composure in a public situation. Bordering between the pleasure and uniqueness that is the human state of affairs. If not pleasure then what else could possibly be the point? 



I look forward to eeky's arrival at the palace. We shall have to entertain a naked dip in the pond. Exposed.



Wonderous open sensations, the month of May\ldots 



may you find your way
