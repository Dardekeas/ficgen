	I am a freshman in college, and I have had some interesting experiences in this year, but none have beaten this one.  Over this past year, I have really developed a dislike for alcohol and a love for cannabis.  I have completely stopped drinking, and exclusively smoked for the past months.  Also, over spring break, I had to have my wisdom teeth removed and my doctor prescribed me Vicodin for the pain.  I used most of the 25 tablets during the surgery, but the 4 that I had left, I took back to school to save for a rainy day.

	Yesterday, I decided to break into that rainy day fund.  Earlier in the week, one of my friends had taken vicodin and smoked, and she had a great time.  There was a party later that night that I was sort of obliged to go to, since all of my friends would be there.  The house is fun, and I like the owners, but I don't really like drunk people at all.  I thought back to my friend who took the vicodin and smoked earlier, and thought that that may be a good plan for the night.  I did some research and experience reading, and I saw some good and bad reports, but most of the reports that I saw that were bad tended to deal with too much vicodin.  The good reports that I saw consisted of about 10mg of vicodin, and a normal night of smoking, maybe 2 or 3 bowls.  I decided that since I had 7.5/750 vicodins, that I would take one, and be fine.  I smoked with my friend before the party, maybe around 10:30, and then took the vicodin before we left.

	When we arrived at the party, the vicodin had not hit me yet. I, of course, was not drinking.  We were some of the first people at the party, so my friend and I just chilled out on the couch, and we and the house owners just talked for a little while.  When people started to arrive, the vicodin hit me.  It was really great, and exactly what I wanted.  I felt warm, and it was almost like I was just floating.  I was in a very introverted mood, but that's just how I usually am.  I wasn't talking to anyone but my close friends that were at the party.  One of the house owners came over to pour someone a shot, and spilled tequila all over me.  I was pissed, because this made me hate the drinking scene even more, but I played it cool, and just went into the bathroom to clean up.  When I came back out, I noticed that the air felt thicker than usual, that it was sort of hard to move through.  I went back to the couch, and relaxed.  While I was just sitting and relaxing in my own world of thought, one of my friends sent me a text telling me to come outside and smoke this joint with them.  

	I probably should have stayed on that couch.  I, however, am always the curious one, and I wanted to see how refreshing my high would make me feel.  I went outside, and there were three other people smoking the joint with me.  It was raining and muddy outside, but I felt just fine.  I took about four tokes, and we were just relaxing.  My friend asked me if I felt ok, and I said that I felt fine.  A few seconds later, however, I felt really heavy and dizzy, and my vision started to darken a little bit.  I put my arm around my friend, and just leaned for a while.  Then I got heavier, and my vision darkened more.  I had to sit down.  There was a rock by where we were standing, and I fumbled over to it and took a seat.  My friend came and held the umbrella over me, everyone out there was relatively experienced with drugs, so no one panicked.  I knew that I wasn't really in medical danger, and that this would wear off.  At no point was I scared.  My thoughts began to become muddy, and I became detached from everything around me.  I was completely alone inside of my own mind.  It must have been about ten minutes, and my friend who was sitting outside with me gave me a jab, and said that it was cold and we should probably go inside.  I didn't really want to, but I felt bad that he spent all this time out here with me, so I got up.  I leaned on him, and we started to walk towards the door.  At this moment, my vision went dark, and I felt like someone was pulling me to the ground.  I had to lay down, I didn't really think about where I was.  I laid down on the mud, and I lost connection with everything around me again.  I closed my eyes and just thought.  I slowly started to remember where I was, and my friends were telling me to get up, I did not realize that I was lying in a puddle of mud.  Getting up and leaning on my friend took another good 3 minutes, and we began to walk inside.  When we got to the kitchen, I started to lose connection with everything again, and we got into one of the owner's bedrooms, where my friends told me to lie down.  I lied down, and proceeded to go into my own mind again.  When I came back in contact with everything outside again, there were about 10 people crowding around me in the room.  Somehow, a rumor that I was mixing alcohol and vicodin started, and everyone was freaking out.  I hated that they were freaking out, I knew that I was fine.  I told people that I couldn't be crowded, that I was going to be fine, and that they should go have a good time.  Most people left, but 3 girls stayed behind, one of which is a really good friend of mine.  I phased in and out of the outside world, and that last joint's effects started to wear off.  I was able to sit up, and my vision returned to normal.  

Someone offered me a ride home, it was about 12:30.  I took her up on it, and I got home and went to sleep feeling warm and floaty much like I had before.  I woke up the next morning feeling great.  I went to practice my cello (my major) for about two hours, and it was some of the best practice I had in a while.  Looking back on the night before, I don't know exactly what happened in those periods where I disconnected.  I wasn't unconscious, but I was thinking, and truly by myself.  I have no idea how long those periods lasted, but they felt like ages.  I don't remember what I thought about, but today, I feel like something has changed inside of me.  Even though I am embarrassed that these events happened at a party instead of inside of my own home, I feel a lot better about myself today than yesterday.  I have a lot more self-confidence and I just feel generally content and happy.  I called my parents and talked to them for a while, and my mom said that I sounded happier than I had in a long time (I had gone through a pretty bad depressive state earlier in the year).  Something inside of me has definitely changed.

I can't say that I would do this again, but I am glad that it happened.  I have no regrets about what happened, I took an educated risk, and it came out with mixed results.  If anyone is thinking about trying this themselves, all that I can say is to do it in a small situation with people that you know.  Be careful, and think about whether you are doing this for fun or a deeper experience, because as feel good the experience was at times, I got more intellectually and emotionally out of that experience than I ever have before.
