I used to sell this stuff. Granted, The trip it sends me on is very fun. I'm very focused, very happy, full of energy. I feel as if the world cant touch me.

Me and my friends fucked with this stuff for a while. I personally had a real bad night with it where I almost overdosed. I took about  25 600 mg tabs. At that point all i did was swallow them\ldots . My body shut down and that night. I only got a broken finger from when I fell. Prior to the fall, my thoughts were incoherant. Could not maintain a steady train of thought.  I tried leaving the movie theater but passed out in the car for about 15 minutes or so, \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  Then drove home and almost wrecked.

5 600 mg pills on an empty stomache sent my friend into a ver bad siezure where she was brought to the hospital\ldots . she almost died that night. She also had the same violent reaction when she took 22 800 mg pills and drank a 40oz of steele reserve ontop of them\ldots . That was a truly bad night that almost ended in her demise as well\ldots .
