My previous drug experience has included Alcohol, Butalbital, Cannabis, Codeine, Dextromethorphan, Lysergic Acid Amide, Nicotine and Nutmeg.  Most recently I have been experimenting with legal substances, out of curiosity and boredom.  This started with Nutmeg.  As pleasant as the experience was, it lasted too long and the disgusting taste and texture of Nutmeg made me decide to look elsewhere for highs.  I was surprised that such a powerful substance was so readily available, and I looked forward to seeing what reaction I would have to other legal drugs.  I tried consuming about 400 Morning Glory seeds by grinding them up and mixing them with yogurt.  I also tried downing a bottle of cough syrup.  I enjoyed trying all of these experiences but would not take any of them on a regular basis, as they all have downsides that seem to outweigh the benefits.  After reading about Dimenhydrinate, I decided that since I had a couple of days off I should give it a shot.  I picked up a bottle of Caffeine pills to keep me awake and a cheap generic packet of 25 Dimenhydrinate tablets at the drug store. 



The next morning I swallowed 5 Caffeine tablets before heading down to the woods, and brought 15 Dimenhydrinate tablets with me along with a water bottle to wash it down with.  Once I reached the woods I sat on a tree trunk and consumed 10 tablets.  I let them settle for a while, and then maybe ten minutes later I finished the other 5.  After a while all of the water I had washed the pills down with started to get to me and I had to go to the washroom.  I decided that I should walk down to a nearby grocery store and use their washroom.  I could've just gone in the woods but I knew that the pills probably wouldn't kick in for another hour so walking to the plaza gave me something to do.



By the time I had gone there and back, the Dimenhydrinate had started to kick in.  I sat down in the woods in an area just next to a busy road and watched the cars go by.  I started to notice something odd.  Often it seemed that cars would drive by that looked identical in style and color to other cars that had just passed by.  At first I thought maybe I was seeing double but when I looked carefully I would see minor differences between the cars, i.e different drivers, different license plates, one had their window open and one had it closed.  I don't know if these cars really did look alike or if I was just mentally imposing the appearance of one car on to cars near it or something.  I saw 3 identical white trucks pass me by in rapid succession.  In my head I was thinking about the possibility that these white trucks were driven by undercover cops and that they were driving by to get a look at me.  So I was feeling a bit suspicious and paranoid.  I also saw police cars in the area several times.  I would wait until the cars had passed me and then go wait in the woods for a few minutes in case more cops came.



Paranoia aside, I was for the most part in a pretty relaxed state, although the Caffeine I had taken prevented me from feeling sleepy.  I started to notice all of the activity happening on the ground below.  Ants and other bugs were scattering in every which way and I could see their every movement whereas I would normally not even notice such things.  There were also two flies sitting beside me who I perceived as being friendly.  At one point a large, strange-looking bug flew at me.  It had different segments like an ant but the segments were attached by a kind of `cord' and it had large wings.  I had never seen a bizarre insect like this and I don't know whether it was real, a hallucination or a combination of the two.



Another thing I noticed was that I could see every detail of the hairs on my arms and legs.  Looking at my arm, it seemed to `glow' in a way and give off a sort of aura.  I also started noticing human-like patterns in the leaves.  Also, every so often I experienced some sort of `blink' effect in which everything suddenly darkened slightly and then went back to normal.  Sometimes my hand or foot would shake rapidly for a moment.  I also started to get a bad case of cottonmouth.  I walked home and took a shower, and then I relaxed in my room for a while and listened to music.  For a little while I felt that weird `pins and needles' effect on one of my hands that made it feel as if it were wet.



All in all I have to say that this drug didn't have as strong an effect on me as I expected it would.  I took 750 mg of it which is more than the typical dose of around 600 mg found in most trip reports.  Other people reported seeing weird blobs and talking to people who weren't really there, yet the only `hallucinations' I experienced - the identical cars, the bug - might very well have been real objects rather than hallucinations.  This is probably partly because I'm bigger than others and therefore would require a larger dose to get those effects.  In any case, I enjoyed the experience but it was nothing life-changing.  I'll probably finish off the last 10 tablets when I get a good opportunity and after that I doubt if I'll try it again.
