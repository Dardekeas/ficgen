Background:

I am 16 the only drugs I've tried other then this is cannabis frequently for the last while and alcohol once, t3's orally for awhile (ran out) and I tried taking nutmeg orally. Got about 2 spoon full down then the next one I spit up to no effect.



Earlier this day:

I haven't eaten since about 6 1/2 hours ago so I have empty stomach, I smoked cannabis bout 7 1/2 hours ago (should be back at baseline). That's the last of my cannabis. I am really bored and I don't like being sober and read both good and bad reports smoking it so if I don't have to taste it decided I'd try it.



Bowl Size: 

width and length = 1 inch

depth = 1 cm



Timeline:



t+0:00

I smoked my first bowl, nutmeg is really flammable. When I lit it it stayed lit the whole time, I had to put it out with bottom of lighter. I took quite a few hits, couldn't keep up with the burning but got quite a bit. Also I agree with the statement of it being heavy smoke, I didn't find it harsh on the throat like cannabis the first time but more harsh directly on the lungs. Burns my nostrils when exhaling through nose.



t+0:01

It really stinks just like nutmeg so I wet my pipe. Gonna let it dry but needed stink out. Had a drink of water.



t+0:02

No effects noticed except slight light headedness. Gonna smoke another bowl.



t+0:03

Smoked second bowl doesn't get any easier on the throat really, didn't burn as easily, because I washed it but it did burn but no less harsh but a bit of chunks of nutmeg washed into my mouth while inhaling (ew!)



t+0:05

Mild marijuana like high, spacey mainly. I ate a banana, hungry but not from nutmeg just from not eating for awhile.



t+0:15

No more effects, want better so I did another half of bowl.



t+0:40

No more effects again the same, did another full bowl, decided that's the last if it doesn't work with 3.5 bowls it's not worth it.



t+1:20

Went for a walk to avoid parents, felt a little nauseas but that's gone.



t+1:50

I feel like I'm back at baseline.



Good Parts:

mild high



Bad parts:

harsh smoke

nauseas (not too bad)

heavy smell

bit of bad taste

short high

need to smoke too much for effects
