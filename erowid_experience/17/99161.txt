A Cautionary Tale



My 18 year old son, Kyle Nolan, died late August 2012. He's on the right in the photo, next to his triplet siblings, Marion and Kevin. Those two went off to college, while Kyle started at a nearby junior college, then dropped out. Finding his way, he didn't know what he wanted to do. He thought Coast Guard, and I encouraged him. I encouraged him anytime he had a plan.



He started reading about ayahuasca, a South American plant that supposedly has profound transformative powers. He latched on to it because he was desperate to know what to do with his life. Over and over he watched a professionally done 90 minute documentary about the Shimbre Center in Peru, `Stepping Into the Fire,' where ayahuasca was the central experience. Kyle worked odd jobs Summer 2012, mainly weeding, mowing, to pay the \$1200 Shimbre ten day program fee, plus the flight to Lima, Peru. It's what he wanted to do.



Both his mother and I researched Shimbre, got reassured by their website and their promotional documentary, `Stepping Into The Fire,' where participants had attendants.



Had I dug deeper, beneath the promotional film, I would have found cautions and warnings, but not many, because Kyle had not yet died. Here's the response to Kyle's death from the ayahuasca community, loud and clear.



http://www.ayahuasca.com/news/public-statement-to-the-ayahuasca-community/



Kyle's mother and sister went to Peru from California when Kyle wasn't on his return flight to SF. They were told by the Shimbre Center that Kyle had wandered away, disconsolate, walking down the dirt road out, pulling his wheeled luggage. Then the Peruvian police got involved, shaman Mancoluto confessed he had found Kyle dead the day after the ceremony in a ditch. Mancoluto wanted to protect his business, so he carried or dragged my son's body further into the jungle and secretly buried him, and lied to the face of Kyle's mother and sister that he had simply wandered off.



Kyle was sent out into the night jungle alone after taking ayahuasca. Shimbre didn't mention this, nor that the shaman Mancoluto believes himself a 5th generation Martian who can protect those wandering in the jungle high on ayahuasca with his Martian telepathy and ESP, while he sits in his hut at the center, on a bank of batteries watching Peruvian soap operas.



Roberto Velez is the man who started Shimbre Center in Peru. Velez is a derivatives broker in NYC. He had transformative experiences with Mancoluto 2008-9, then spent a million or millions building the Shimbre Center and making the 90 minute promotional film, Stepping Into The Fire.



For two years (2010-12) now back in NY, Velez was warned repeatedly his shaman was out of control, his particular ayahuasca brew included known toxins, esp. datura, and no one attended the ayahusaca participants wandering through the jungle. In response Velez did nothing.



Shimbre (9 miles from Puerto Maldonado) has closed down because of my son's death. The shaman got 3 years probation for secretly burying my son in the jungle.



I've raised \$8000 through fundly.com to bring my son's body home from Peru for forensic examination and proper burial.  The autopsy by Dr. Kelly Arthur-Kenny is \$3500 for it to be released to me, which is my current fundly.com campaign:  http://fundly.com/3500-for-written-autopsy-on-my-son-kyle-nolan-who-died-under-suspicious-circumstances-in-peru?ft\_src=FollowNotification\&ft\_aid=33263. ;



The cautionary tale? Dig deeper.



Sean Bruce Nolan



Charlatan shamans are out there. They move in for the quick buck. In Kyle's case, the NY broker, Roberto Velez, that built Shimbre in Peru and then went back to NY, I believe he meant well, and it was his inability to see (after he had been told and told) that the shaman he had such attachment to was out of control, that led to Kyle's death.



What I believe is fair and which honors my son is for Roberto Velez to step up, acknowledge his culpability, fund this foundation I've already started here ('Campaign for Kyle Nolan'):



http://fundly.com/3500-for-written-autopsy-on-my-son-kyle-nolan-who-died-under-suspicious-circumstances-in-peru?ft\_src=FollowNotification\&ft\_aid=33263



The foundation would be a central registry of shamans with feedback from participants. Ayahusaca retreats are becoming more and more tourist big business, blossoming esp. in Peru and Brazil. It's the wild west down there. And all it takes is harried parents, a naive kid willing to take a risk outside his comfort zone, with enough passion to do it that he earned the money himself weeding and mowing lawns AND a slick documentary, `Stepping into the Fire' and a website (now down) that didn't reflect the dangers participants were put in.



Since September I've raised \$8600 on fundly.com and brought Kyle's body home to California from Peru, where he could be further autopsied and get a proper burial.  My current challenge and campaign is to raise \$3500 (\$1590 so far) to receive the written autopsy report from the forensic pathologist, Dr. Kelly Arthur-Kenny.



This is what I'm doing to honor my 18 year old son's death, a directory or registry on the expanding shamanic retreats in South America and elsewhere. This `conversation' is from the ayahuascaworld site on facebook:



    Kevin Davis Im not sure that we will ever see registered shamans in the wild west. This last trip to Peru\ldots .. I met with a doctor friend there who is talking about legislation to have a doctor at every retreat. I can't see that happening although it would be nice. I can't imagine losing a son and what that feels like. It must tear you up inside. I know for most of us\ldots . we stand in shock trying to make some sense of this. I myself am in the process of starting a wellness center. Know that I will always have one sober person watching guests during a ceremony because of what happened to your son. And there will always be a doctor on the premises. Im appalled that Robert has not stepped up to the plate and taken any responsibility for his lack of common sense. Ive donated once to the foundation and will do so again if you don't reach your goal soon. Please know that most of us in the Ayahuacsa community have learned some valuable lessons from your sons death and hopefully this kind of thing will never occur again.

    Carlos Tanner I have been speaking with a department of tourism in Iquitos who is also compiling a database and have offered to make that database more available to the ayahuasca community. There have been several initiatives in the past to certify curanderos so it is not a new concept and one that I feel is needed and will be needed even more in the future. A registry would be much easier, as it is would be essentially a listing of curanderos with feedback from people who have experience with them. I talked about doing it a while back, but had to change my mind for my own safety, as I was a bit worried that I would get attacked by people who'd had bad things written about them. I work in this world, however, so for someone outside of this world to put it together would be a much better idea. I support the endeavor.

    Sean Nolan Kevin and Carlos, thank you for your comments. It was Kyle's death that made information public about unsafe practices at Shimbre. Had I had such information--any of it--I wouldn't have let my son go to Shimbre. There may have been warnings out there, but I didn't come across them. The Shimbre website and the film `Stepping Into The Fire' were a dangerous veneer. We'd be irresponsible to believe this can't happen again. Kevin, I don't want to impose restrictions or inhibit shamanic practices, but groomed participant comments on websites like Shimbre only serve to make the veneer thicker. While I don't yet know what final format a directory of shamanic retreats would take, it would definitely center around unedited participant responses for each retreat, and easily found with a basic google search. Carlos, as you say, I come from outside the ayahuasca community, my core motivation having Kyle's death be a singular event, and therefore his death mean something. I have 20 years experience compiling a directory called Minority \& Women Doctoral Directory, which failed a year ago due to recession, which hit U.S. higher education very hard. That 900 page two-volume annual Directory I published listed women and minority Ph.D.s to increase their recruitment for assistant professor positions at American universities. I have never been contacted by Roberto Velez, which I find shameful. Perhaps he's been told by his legal team to not contact me, when what I want is him to step up and fund a registry or directory which I will then take off with.

    Sean Nolan In the meantime, I'm pressing forward with my Fundly `Campaign for Kyle Nolan' http://fundly.com/3500-for-written-autopsy-on-my-son-kyle-nolan-who-died-under-suspicious-circumstances-in-peru?ft\_src=FollowNotification\&ft\_aid=33263, and hope Velez realizes he should be a major part of it.
