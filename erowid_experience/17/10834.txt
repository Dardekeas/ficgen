Codeine 90 mg, diphenhydramin 50 mg, st. John's wort and kava kava (10 gm tea)



For the past 6 months I have been experimenting with codeine at rather low doses.  I am getting quite good at extracting it from tablets containing 10 mg codeine and 500 mg parasetamol (or acidaminophen as you call it), I think I'm getting about 80-90\% extracted and I have had to practice quite alot.  I was in Greenland a few months ago and there you can buy painkillers with codeine without any trouble, as much as you like and very cheap.  I never take acidaminophen if I have a headache, it's to poisonus for my taste.



At first I didn't feel much from the codeine taking 100-200 mg.  I thought the extraction was not working.  Now I think codeine is one of those drugs you have to know to enjoy, like Kava Kava.  So be patient.  I think I had to take it 20 or 30 times before I learned to enjoy it and even recognize it.



Last weekend I took about 90 mg of codeine and one tablet of diphenhydramine,  I also drank some St. John's Wort and Kava Kava tea.  Diphenhydramine is a very potent drug and should not be taken in high doses but it has the power to potentiate opiads if taken in moderation.  After about an hour I felt very sedatet, confortably numb you could say.  I just sat in my living room and watched tv, the movie was Dracula 2001.  I don't really remember the film, it might be the effect of the diphenhydramine, but I felt very nice.  My mouth was rather dry (probably the diphenhydranine) and when I looked in the mirror I had pinpoint pupils, I looked quite stoned.  I took my bloodpressure and it was in the normal but quite alot lower than usual, my bloodpressure goes down when I take Kava Kava.



The next morning I woke up and felt quite good but rather lazy.  A few weeks ago I had taken about 150 mg of codeine and then there was a blackout, I saw almost nothing because of my pinpoint pupils.  I think codeine is nice but quite abusable.  I plan to use it only once a week.
