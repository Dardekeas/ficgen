Before I begin, I would like to communicate some of my own understandings of DiPT and how they have helped my personal growth.  Iâve had several experiences with DiPT, and they all have been rewarding.  Around 30 to 35 mg. is a suitable dose for me, and I find that too much leads to unpleasant effects, like nausea and overwhelming terror.  Many people report that the effects of this drug only contribute to hearing, and I believe that this is insufficient information.

	

For me, the hearing is a large factor in the experience, but I also observe other intense factors.  One of these, the sharpness of vision leads to being so sharp and intense that the hearing and visuals start to organize in a frightening way.  This drug can also crush the ego like DPT, and that is also a factor. This substance has helped me to see the strong effects of DPT in ways that are not as threatening, while exploring the other interesting effects that configure the character of DiPT. With that being said, this is my report with this wonderful substance in combination with 4-AcO-DET and Sebor Absinth:

	

12:45:30 p.m.:  Swallow 2 little pills.  One is 4-AcO-DET (30 mg.), the other, 20 mg. of DiPT.  Iâm on my second glass of Sebor Absinth (very generous glasses and I am not a drinker).  Feeling pretty nice.  Anticipation of what is to come of course.  Got a pill of 20 mg. of DPT ready for later.  Also plan to take  100 mg. pill of Darvocet later to help me sleep.

	

Now the next six hours are spent in my room, and the entire time seems like consistent intensity.  The absinth made it really smooth to go into it, because with my judgement being off, I was able to move freely deeper into places that I would not have gone otherwise because of terror.  Perhaps the peak was dulled from the alcohol in the Sebor Absinth during the initial onset, making the entire trip seem like the same intensity.  I stop drinking two hours into the trip, after my third glass.

	

7:00 p.m.:  This has been the most unique and interesting experience as of yet.  The visuals are amazing.  Things moving and things becoming screaming faces and eyes.  The coolest thing I see is a floating man.  The DiPT is stronger than I imagined, but not unpleasantly scary.  The visuals are fascinating to concentrate into.  The only thing not 100\% is that I can think too clearly.  The DPT is no longer needed, this is strong enough like DPT to the point that Iâm too exhausted to want to go further with anything more like it.  This is manageable to a likeable degree, and this definitely put a really demonic side to the 4-AcO-DET.  This is just- INCREDIBLE.  Iâm listening to a song called âUse Your Fist And Not Your Mouthâ, and thatâs like trying to describe this, you just need to get hit with it.

	

Spaces open up like DPT, sucking life out of me with terror, but this is altered in a way that allows lots of concentration into those spaces. This has been lasting much longer than I thought it would.  Iâm six hours in and Iâm still tripping hard.  Wow, this combination brings the best out of each one. And the absinth affects it as well because I can recognize what it causes. Very subtle but definitely recognized in adding its magical clarity and contributing to the long performance I think.

	

I know that the brutal side to this trip was the DiPT, but Iâm questioning the force itself.  What was that DPT-like terror that would thrust out at me?  It was me?  It seemed like my eyes focused on the details of objects at different distances, which eventually lead to a strobing effect, and then into a black space opening up where lunging faces would come out attacking me.  It is the same effect as DPT, but not as frequent.  It was like Death opening up and sucking life out of me. I actually felt the blood stop circulating  in my hands at the point of this happening.  To me it felt like the fear, \&/or life, it was taking was an exchange of energy.  For example, the deeper I traveled into it, the more I took from it and the deeper it traveled into me the more it took from me.  It seemed like a tug-of-war for energy, like we were dancing together, taking turns leading.  It felt like the fear of a bad nightmare and I even heard growling out of the blackness.  Is there some sort of life on the other side of the Universe that itâs feeding?  The cold and terrifying feeling, so like DPT, is so like Death.  

	

Now itâs nine hours in and things are gradually getting back to normal.  I took one Darvocet (100 mg.) and Iâm beginning to feel it working some.  One thing that I noticed is how the tension in the jaw effected the visuals.  If I moved my jaw, the visuals got a lot stronger.  The 4-AcO-DET definitely potenated the DiPT and added tremendously to the visuals and the great body high.  The pleasant feeling helped direct the trip out of the darkness of the DiPT, as well as adding its own character to it.  I cannot say it enough, how good the visuals were.  I think the 4-AcO-DET contributed to me seeing the floating outline of a man, which was, just wow.  



It is now the day after this trip, and I feel no negative after effects.  My heads slightly spaced out, but I donât consider that negative.  Codeine helps my body from feeling stiff. 



In conclusion, I feel that this has been my most favorable journey that I have underwent in my entire life.  There has been nothing, nothing at all like this.  I am just entirely honored that the Universe has opened up to me the way that it did.  The pleasant mushroom feeling of 4-AcO-DET, at an ego threatening dose; and the  ferocious DiPT in combination is an atomic bomb!
