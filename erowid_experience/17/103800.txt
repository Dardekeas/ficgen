I will start my story by saying that I am in no way a weed smoker.  I have used marijuana only 3 times in my life and I never really enjoyed the high very much.  On this particular night, however, I was drinking heavily and I was surrounded by 5 very close friends who could all be classified as ``pot heads''.  When the night grew late I slowly began to be curious about weed (even though I knew I didn't like the high when I was sober).  And after watching all of them take huge hits from their bong, I decided to give it a try.

My friends were all giggling as I grabbed the bong and placed it to my lips.  I inhale drastically and hold it in as long as I can.  I immediately feel light-headed and lay back in the couch.  I close my eyes and just listen to the sounds of the room as my head was spinning from already consuming approximately 9-10 beers. 

After about 20 minutes I begin to get intense chills down my spine.  At this point I can still see straight and I am aware of my surroundings.  I look at my friends as they all laugh and watch TV.  I try to force a smile, but I am pretty uncomfortable because of these chills down my spine.

Another 20 minutes go by and I can no longer see.  My eyes were open but I could not make sense of anything I was seeing.  The intense chills turned into an almost electrocuting sensation throughout my entire body.  I knew something was wrong so I tried to tell my friends but I truly had no control over my speech.  I couldn't keep a thought long enough to form a sentence and I began to shake slightly.  Not sharp shakes but more of a fast rocking of my head.

As I closed my eyes I began to hallucinate back to times of my childhood.  I remembered taking Spanish classes in elementary school and I vividly played back my thought processes for trying to remember words with very abstract means. I still don't know if those were real methods that I used or if I was hallucinating a memory.  It was an extremely uncomfortable time as I remembered extremely strange patterns that I cannot describe.  All the while I was feeling intense electrical shocks throughout my entire body and I was more uncomfortable than I have ever been in my life.  

Throughout the trip I continued to hallucinate and get extremely scared.  Like I was living in a very bad nightmare, fully conscious, but unable to move or speak to my friends.  After an hour of this hallucination my body simply had enough and I puked everywhere, out of nowhere, and uncontrollably.  My friends all jumped to my rescue and gave me a bucket as I heaved my guts out for 10 minutes.  After puking, all hallucinations stopped and the chills stopped as well.  I was extremely exhausted so my friends gave me clean clothes and I passed out.  

The next morning I was completely fine. Not even a hangover.  From that day on, I swore that I would NEVER try marijuana again. Something about it simply doesn't agree with my body.
