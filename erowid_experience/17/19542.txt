I passed my drug test!  



Considering my weight and my body fat composition (I'm 5'0) I was terrified I would never be able to pass a piss test.  When the job I was interviewing for told me they were going to test, I almost walked out, but I needed the job really bad.  I had planned to use substitution, but when my donor backed out on me I had to think of something quick -- test had to be that day.



Lady Luck was smiling on me -- I'd been dry for almost a week when the job interview came up, and the interview process took a week before I had to pee.  But I knew I'd still test positive unless I did something drastic.



Three hours before the test, I drank 5 LARGE glasses of water, ate a piece of peanut butter toast (the fats supposedly help), and took two caplets of Horsetail (Shavegrass is another one that works, dunno if they are the same or not) that I had gotten from my local health food store.  Horsetail is a diuretic.  Another good one is Buchu.  I also took two b-complex vitamins to give it some color.



Urinated several times before I left for the test (don't worry, with the Horsetail you'll come up with plenty of urine), then drove thru the snow to take the test.  I was observed and they wouldn't let me wash my hands (gross!).  Came up with midstream test sample -- which was NEON yellow.  Pale, but still neon.  Lo and behold, I passed.



Side effects included a niacin flush reaction from so much b complex and pissing dark neon yellow for two days. 



Good luck and beat those bladder cops!
