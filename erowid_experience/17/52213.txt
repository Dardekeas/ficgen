The first time I smoked salvia was a very life changing experience, but before I go into that, I'll explain my setting and knowledge of salvia.



The day before I smoked my friends were telling me all of their experiences their stories seeming unbelievable. They told me to just hold the hit or `hippy hit it' as we call it, as long as I could. Then they said just stare at something and like read into it, see what it is. That is what I was thinking when I did it.



We were sitting in a van, we had just purchased a gram of 20x. I went into this with a very clear mindset, I was prepared, is the only way I can think of putting it. The girl next to me took her hit, passed me the pipe, I took my hit, and turned around to stare at the outside. It hit me immediately. The first thing that happened was I looked to my right, and there was a chain link fence. The fence had a very evil feel to it, and when I looked at it the fence began shaking violently, like vibrating almost. So I turned my head.



There was a butterfly sticker on the window to my right. I just looked at it.  All of a sudden, my body just melted into the seat.  The most vivid part I remember about the melting experience, was feeling my teeth melt out of my body, as if my whole body melted, but I left all things that are solid behind, it was a very alarming feeling. I looked around and was no longer in the van, I had melted into something different, a different world, a different place. The butterfly was being held, by two giant hands.  And the hands were sitting there holding the butterfly. My friends said that I was sitting there silent, then just blurted out `Why are you holding that butterfly?' As soon as I said those last words, the butterfly took off. And I felt free. There was a definate connection between me and the butterfly, as if it was part of me being released. At this point I felt my body solidify, I was ripped from my world.



I remember when I woke up I asked everyone the question `When is it?' Referring to where am I, what time is it, what year is it. They told me to relax and I'll be fine in a minute. At this point I felt the need to talk to my best friend, like I was worried if he was ok, I felt an evil presence outside of the van. He told me he was fine, so I relaxed smoked a cig and came down from the trip.



If I were to say that I am the same person I was before I smoked would be a lie. It's as if I saw a world so much more beautiful than anything I had ever seen before. I was disappointed to be in this world.



Salvia is not a party drug. I was around too many people when I did it, and didn't know all of them that well. It would have been better if I was with my best friends I think. But to say salvia is just another drug is a complete lie. It is an experience, a journey. It was the most incredible experience of my life, and I cannot wait to do it again.
