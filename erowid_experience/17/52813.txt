I have experimented with this substance several times prior to this attempt, unfortunately I had something of a bad experience this time around.  My previous doses had been between 5-30mg, it only seemed natural to go from 30mg to 35mg, I didn't expect it to be quite as different as it was (who does.)



T+0:00  Me and a few buddies of mine weigh out our doses and encapsule them.  I decided with 35mg, as I was the most experienced with the substance, while the others settled at a more reasonable 20mg each.  My mindset was basically positive, nothing bad in my head, just ready for a good/interesting time with a few friends.  We're all eating barbecue chips as we converse.



T+0:20  The four of us talk about nothing in particular while waiting for drug to begin affecting us.  We're still eating.  Nothing too interesting to report.



T+0:30  What seem to be the first `alerts' are coming on; of course, it could just be my imagination.  However, my stomach is starting to feel something of a tension, not quite nausea though.  I brush it off as no big deal, seeing as I oftentimes experience that sort of feeling on a wide variety of phenethylamines (2C-I, 2C-B, DOI, DOC, for example.)



T+0:45  The visuals are definately kicking in at this point.  Nothing too major, just some barely noticeable tracers and warping.  Friends seem to just be getting their first `alerts' around this time, to which I attribute to my higher dose.  Stomach tension somewhat increased, but still I feel as though it's the same as all the other phens.



T+1:00  This is about when I start to feel quite bad.  The stomach tension has crossed the line into painful territory, and I feel like I'm going to throw up; however, throughout the whole experience I never felt truly nauseous.  I make my way to the toilet and at first throw up an extremely small amount and suddenly feel a lot better.  After that I thought I was done and ready to resume the enjoyment\ldots  I was wrong.  Perhaps 40 seconds after the first `mini-puke' I threw up again.  This time I expelled what seemed like more than my whole stomach.  This process wasn't exactly painful like other times I've thrown up, it just seemed to happen.  The visuals seemed quite predominant at this point, also.  Watching my puke swirl to the background of the melting walls and floor was something of an odd beauty.  After cleaning up myself I go retrieve some gatorade from the refrigerator and get back to my buds who all seem quite concerned about me (they were probably just worried that it would happen to themselves.)



T+1:20  Because of my unfortunate reaction, my friends and I decided we should get to a relaxing setting and try to keep me from having to return to the bathroom.  Apparently our idea of that was to watch some movies, not any that would make us think to hard, just some action movies.  This really wasn't that bad of an idea, and it did accomplish decreasing overactive thought.



T+1:40  A short way into Gladiator I went from feeling fine to instant-need-to-puke, so I make my way into the bathroom and expell what I recently drank; again, no pain, just vomit.



T+2:00-8:00  Nothing all that eventful occured for the rest of the time.  I felt mostly sober for the rest of the time, with the exception of moderately intense visual activity.  Physically and mentally I was basically normal; however, I attribute this mostly to the setting and the intentional `dumbing down' of the rest of the night.



Chances are I will not use this substance at this level again; but, I may return to test the waters with lower doses at some point.
