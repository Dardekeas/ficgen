I took about 17 grams of powdered nutmeg (the kind you can just buy at the grocery store.) Anyway, I tried mixing it with water, but I found that to be very disgusting. I forced myself to drink it, however, then decided to drink a coke afterwards, which did help get rid of some of the bad taste. I waited all night for something to happen, but I experienced a mere cigarette type buzz. 



When I woke up the next day, I felt very tired. I was on my way to school, and I remember thinking objects were moving, or objects were in a place that they were not. All day I was sort of in a daze, and people would say things that made little sense to me. What I compare it to is just being drunk, or coming down from a MJ high. I would definitly try it again, probably upping the dosage and going for a more fresh nutmeg. =)
