Lets start this tale off by saying I am an experienced tripper. I have eaten so many psylocybin mushrooms that I cant even begin to fathom the amount that I have shoved down the hatch and have had 5 awesome acid trips with a few that were merely `okay' sprinkled in here and there.



So, with that out of the way, the 2C-i experience began at a friends house. I was headed over there to rock out some Guitar Hero on the PS2 with my friends and smoke a few blunts. When I got there, he had a couple other guys chillin in the basement that I had never met before. After a few rounds of the bong, we started discussing a few of our favorite substances and one of the other guys said something about taking 2C-i and loving it and that he had a little extra. I snagged a couple of capsules from him and started to get excited but thought I would wait until I had a full day to take them because I wanted to take them during the day and have a nice `day trip'.



About a week later, I found myself receiving a call and getting an offer for a job that I had just applied for. This was awesome news and I decided it was time to celebrate\ldots  enter 2C-i.



It was about 6pm when another friend of mine picked me up from my house. She was expecting a night of hanging out and smoking blunts until we passed out, but I had a surprise for her\ldots 



I couldnt even wait until we got back to her house. As soon as we pulled out of my driveway I pulled out the 2 capsules that I had bought. They were the large `horse pill' looking capsules that you get from a natural market for making your own vitamins, or whatever, and they had about an 8th of an inch of the white powder at the bottom. I handed one to my friend and we downed them at the same time(both on pretty empty stomachs).



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



We made it back to my friends house and I sat down and ground up some of the bud I had. It was only commercial, however, it was the best I had EVER seen(no seeds at all, very small stems.. it was even somewhat crystally but it was still bricked..) I rolled us a nice little blunt from a Phillie peach cigarello and we sat back and watched TV while we turned it to ash\ldots 



So, as we are sitting on the couch, I notice that Im becoming increasingly slouched and it feels a lot like the couch is sucking me in. Since my friend had never tripped before, I kind of took on the roll of `guide' for this experience and I asked if she would like to go outside with me while I smoke a cigarette.



We migrate our way to the back of her house and out the back door to the small yard area. The house backs up to a cliff that overlooks a small stream and there is a sort of balcony built in to the side of the cliff where she has a table and some chairs. While I was smoking the cigarette, I looked up through the trees and noticed that the clouds were being sucked in to the tops of the trees. This didnt make sense to me all until I looked at the clock on my phone\ldots  ooops\ldots  it is now t+1 hour after taking the caps and I know this stuff is starting to come on. We sat out on the balcony for about 20-30 minutes, both kind of in our own world  watching the world transform around us. 



At one point, I thought I felt a bug on my arm so I looked down to brush it off but it wasnt there. I held my arms out in front of me upside down so that I could see the bottom of my forearm and all of the sudden a `persian rug' pattern starts crawling out of the crease on the bottom side of my elbow and heading toward my palms. The more I concentrate on it, the more it reaches for my hands and if I look away, it dissapears and I have to focus to make it `come back'\ldots  `Not quite peak, yet', I thought. 



We eventually made our way back inside and by this point I know the 2C-i is starting to peak. The persian rug was all over the stuc-o ceiling and it started to swirl around the vents for the heating and A/C. My friend had some cardboard fish taped up on the wall in the living room where we were and they started to swim away from us. We had a pretty good time for a while just checking out all of the action in the room and we deicded to watch a movie to see if anything cool happened(since it was dark outside by this point). 



We watched a couple movies that I am very familiar with but I couldnt follow the plot because there were too many visuals going on in the background to focus on the characters. The visuals were very `patterny' which is about the only way I can describe it. For example, in one of the movies, there was a scene in an office and each desk had a desk lamp on it. The lamps were the only thing I could focus on and it looked like they were strategically laid out so that the distance between each one would be the same to form a kind of `grid' pattern.



The rest of the night was a lot of noticing these `patterns'. The only other strong visual I can remember was how intense lights were. I walked outside and a street light almost hurt my eyes because it seemed so bright and there were 5 individual `fingers' of light that were waving around coming out of each street light. The persian rug pattern was on just about everything I looked at for a good 6 hours.



in summary the visuals are great, the body high is awesome and theres not that `completely out of my mind' feeling I get when doing something like LSD or psylocybin\ldots  at least that is my 2 cents.
