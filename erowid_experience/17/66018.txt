(Note: I have been on anti-psychotics since March 2006. I have been on the Lithium/Abilify cocktail since December 2006.)



I am diagnosed Bipolar I-Manic. Generally, my mood is stable because of my medications. However, I tend to be lethargic and apathetic because of those same medications. I take frequent naps during a typical day. 



When I smoke meth, I feel `normal.' I feel clear-headed, focused, energetic, and motivated. I am able to do my job more effectively and efficiently. I feel an overwhelming sense of happiness and calm. In effect, I feel like a normal person, not the heavily medicated crazy girl that I actually am in real life. 



Usually, I smoke half a gram to a gram over the course of a day. I stay up for one or maybe two nights. Generally, after 2 nights of being awake, I am exhausted and weary, and feel `cracked out' and spacey. However, there have been precisely 2 times when I was skewing manic and then smoked meth and I was able to stay awake for 4-5 nights without feeling anything negative at all. In fact, it felt like I was sleeping 8 hours a night in terms of how my body and brain felt. 



To sum up, I didn't really have any problems with the combination of Lithium, Abilify, and crystal meth.
