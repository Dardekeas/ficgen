Having quite a bit of experience with 6-APB, we decided to push things a bit further than normal.



10:40PM 160mg 6-apb parachute with 1g Vit C tablet



11:30PM 140mg 6-apb parachute.



12:00PM Coming up, the music sounded so much better favourite DJ has just came on, normal MDMA-esque effects I normally get (only more stimmed than lovey feeling in my body)



12:15AM Everybody else comes up strong, group hugs and photos begin!



12:30AM Waves of rushes, even more intense by the heat in the room. (pupils considerably dilated)



12:45AM Shivers of euphoria as the strobes go and the beat drops!



12:50AM Friend runs her hand through my hair and down my back and my whole body freezes from such an intense feeling.



1AM Cigarette, long drags really give a strong head rush and `high' feeling



2AM Contact with people is amazing, appreciating every beat of the music. Familiar `lovey' feeling for whoever I speak to, just like a certain similar illegal chemical!



2:30AM Deep hits of the popper, makes the lights sensational and my body pulsing with waves of amazingness.



Continued with approx. 3 more cigarettes, and poppers maybe 5/6 times per hour until 5AM. Dancing and contact with women/friends brings waves of happiness and energy.



5:00AM Lights on. Music off. Still trying to dance and make music up in our heads! Peoples faces look very slightly `smudged' (potentially dilation of pupils preventing eyes to focus properly, or just tripping!)



5:30AM Home, music put on and everyone begins subtly moving to the beat. Each take a double 8g charger balloon, inhaled whilst doing head rush (head between legs stand up etc.) all of us trip hard. What I could imagine an LSD trip to be like, was a very insightful strange experience.  



Take single 8g charger balloons and lay with head off the bed inhaling/exhaling into balloon for aprox. 3mins? Swirling visuals, went into trip mode again. Altering each time with what noises are playing. (With my choice of song, I ceased to exist and could only see strobes of bright colours and feel each beat of the music pass through me)



9:00AM Call it a night.



Struggle sleeping, take 2 x 100mg 5-HTP and after getting about 3 hours sleep and waking up at 4PM, I felt amazing, no comedown as usual.
