I wasn't expecting much from kanna, considering the negative prior experiences I have had with legal herbs.  I bought 3 grams from an online supplier.  When the package arrived, they kanna was a greenish powder.  I sniffed about 50 mg, and put another 50 into a piece of gum I was chewing.  It didn't taste as horrid as others have described. 



About 10 minutes later I had a lovely feeling in my stomach.  I felt really good.  I felt stimulated yet calm at the same time.  I definately couldn't compare it to any other drug I have done (which is quite of few).  I found to be the littlest things amusing and interesting.  I felt fantastic.



About 20 minutes later, I smoked a cigarette which intensified the experience.  I felt like I was mildly high on marijuana, yet highly stimulated on caffeine.  



About 5 minutes after that, I smoked about a half gram of marijuana.  Now, I felt very loose and relaxed.  I felt pretty happy, more so than usual.  



This happy high all faded away for about 3.5 hours before I was back to baseline.  The comedown was very calm and comfortable.  



From this experience, I have learned that kanna is a powerfull mood enhancer, and can really lighten a person up.  It would be a nice way to unwind after a long hard way.  I also learned not to under estimate the power of a substance, legal, or not.
