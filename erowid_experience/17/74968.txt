Allow me to preface this writing with some background information:



I've done a lot of experimentation with various substances over the years.  I learned my limitations as well as the substances I'd never try again.  Methamphetamine is one of the major drugs at the top of that `never again' category.



I recently moved to a college town, and Adderall is very common around here.  As much as I should know about drugs by now; I didn't realize Adderall was an amphetamine - thus, it should have fit the same category as meth.  This was my first (and last) experiment with Adderall.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Last Saturday, a very good friend of mine (I'll refer to him as X) and I were chilling out at my apartment.  We were watching some sports and drinking very heavily (approximately 5:00 P.M.-12:00 A.M.)  After we were both very much intoxicated, X asked me if it was alright if he blew a few lines of Adderall.  I'd given him some grief about using it in the past, but I told him I didn't care.  He offered me some, but I refused it.  After he'd finished a few pills, he got up and suggested that we hit the club and chase some girls.  I was beyond the point of being able to socialize, so I told him to just go by himself.  I wanted to pass out.



As soon as he'd left, my roommate arrived with some of his friends.  They wanted to party.  I didn't feel comfortable with people I didn't know being here, so I decided to stay up with them.  I could tell I was embarrassingly drunk, and I didn't want to make an ass of myself in front of new people.  I looked at the plate my friend had used to snort the Adderall, and there was a lot left.  I knew people used Adderall to focus, stay awake, and bring themselves ``up'' from a drunken state.  I took the plate to my bathroom, rolled up a dollar bill, and snorted what was left.  It didn't hurt like I expected it to, and there were no immediate effects.  I went back out to the living room to hang out with my roommate and his friends.



All of a sudden; I felt awake and clear.  I became more of an extrovert than I'd ever been in my life.  Considering all the alcohol consumption that had occurred (and ended minutes prior); I was suddenly totally sober.  After a short while, my roommates friends asked me how much I'd had to drink.  I told them how much, then asked, ``Why, am I making a drunken ass out of myself or something?''  One remarked, ``No, but you're insane!  I'd be puking my guts out.''  



I got paranoid for a second, because I didn't want them to think I was an alcoholic or something but then I didn't care because it might impress them but who cares what they think because I'm totally straight and maybe the Adderall didn't do anything and it was just the food I'd eaten that sobered me up and why are we watching a Jackie Chan movie and I have to be somewhere tomorrow and maybe life is wonderful.  My mind was racing like this non-stop.  I was composing myself and being very careful to talk sensibly and not stream of consciousness babble.  I hope my state of mind was conveyed here.



I had really bad dry mouth, but I wasn't thirsty.  I forced myself to keep drinking some wine in order to try to calm my mind and body down.  By the time they left (about 4:00 A.M.), I'd drank enough that I was tired again.  Then, X showed up again.  I could tell he was flying (he'd done about 4 or 5 more pills at the club), and I didn't want him to stay there chatting me up for hours on end.  He asked if he could do some more Adderall, and I told him he could only if he gave me some.  We split a pill, and then I snorted some wine to speed up the drip.  



We kept drinking as he told me his club story, and at this point time stopped existing.  I have no idea how long we talked.  I had consumed a total of 4 40oz malt liquors, 6 12 oz. beers, and 5 glasses of wine, but I was still awake.  Eventually, I told him I was feeling tired.  He left, and I laid down on my couch.  I don't actually think I went to sleep.  Everything was just black for what could have been five minutes or god knows how long.



I shot awake suddenly.  It was as if someone had dumped ice water on my face.  I was extremely alert and my mind was telling me I should get more Adderall.  I had a headache (not the alcohol induced type, either): my nose and face were stinging: my body ached (well, it was actually more flushed and I felt hot): and I wanted more Adderall.



It was a Sunday morning (I recall looking at the clock and seeing it was about 10:30 A.M.) and I had to be somewhere in a few hours.  On the way there, I felt so tense.  It was as if I was driving to ``face the music'' so to speak, and this is odd because the outing was to a place that is very pleasant.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



I had some pretty random periods of irritability.  I had to force feed myself dinner, and drinking anything (even water) was a chore.  After getting back to my apartment later Sunday night, I hit a psychological wall.  I was so depressed and uneasy.  X called me to ask for a ride to get cigarettes.  When I told him I felt shitty, he offered me Adderall in exchange for the ride.  I didn't want any of it, so he offered to buy me a pack of smokes.



After I picked X up, he asked, ``So, man, isn't Adderall the shit?''  I said, ``No, it is shit, and I haven't felt quite this shitty since I tried meth a few years ago.  It's garbage.''



I couldn't sleep when I got home.  I was wide awake, but at least I was able to drink water without choking it down.  As the hours and minutes ticked away, I got more depressed than I've ever been in my life.  I'd been ``awake'' 46 hours or so, and I started getting paranoid.  I called my friends and started giving them these insanely paranoid and bizarre stories.  My friends all suggested the same thing, ``Calm down, and get some sleep.  Things will be better this afternoon.''



I skipped all of my responsibilities yesterday to sleep.  It was a deep and dark sleep.  I woke up in the late afternoon and felt a lot better.  I decided to go online and study the drug I'd used, and immediately noticed that it contains ``amphetamine salts.''   I was so pissed at myself for trying it without researching it first.  I won't repeat that mistake again.
