 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 

I was probably only like 13 or so back then, and I was hanging out with one of my friends. Well anyways we were getting tired or just smoking butts to be cool, and we didn't know anyone who sold pot, so we just headed over to my neighbors tool shed and grabbed a can of gasoline. Anyways the first few huffs from the can weren't anything spectacular, just lots of weird noises and everything looked as if it were being zoomed out like on camcorder. We were in the woods so we didn't really have to hide from anybody, and it was pretty cool to see all the trees sliding back and forth so I kept on huffing.

After about 5 huffs, the effects started to get longer. The first few times they would only last about 30 seconds and my mind would be somewhat foggy and confused for about 5 minutes. Seriously, during those 5 minutes, I couldn't even remember why I was in the woods, it was as if I just wandered out there and got lost. Then on the 5th hit from the can, I began to see in double vision and I could hear a buzzing sound like a chainsaw and it sounded like someone was screaming my name off in the distance somewhere, it really began to freak me out. But when I came to, I just shrugged it off and thought it was cool. 

I probably huffed it about 5 more times that day, and that was the last time I ever touched it. Back then I didn't know of any of the dangers, but immediately after doing it, I began looking into the effects and dangers. Everything I read basically scared the living hell out of me, and I never touched it or thought about doing it again.
