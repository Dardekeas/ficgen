Recently a friend tried to commit suicide by taking 50 Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine) tablets.  The tablets are only made in 10mg form, so she had 500mg along with some alcohol.  The warnings in my PDR (Physicians Desk Reference) say not to take more than 6 tablets.  She was VERY LUCKY.



She lost about 12 hours worth of memory and was terribly ill for a couple of days.  It was not only an ineffective way to commit suicide, but a terribly unpleasant one.



From personal experience I would ask that no one take more than 6.  You will start to feel bad after that.  To be completely honest, taking more than 4 is just a waste, you will not get any more `high' after 4 tablets.  I know some seriously dangerous pill freaks who have the highest tolerance there is - they still think it is a waste to take more than four.



  The reason my friend is alive is because Flexeril is a muscle relaxant that only relaxes skeletal muscles, and not muscles like your heart.  This makes it a very safe drug.  Luckily my friend was unaware of this.  Fifty tablets of almost anything will kill you, even vitamins.



  If you feel like killing yourself please just get really drunk and call some friends or get arrested.  Seek professional help, if life is that bad, professional help can make it better.  It really can, and the help is out there.
