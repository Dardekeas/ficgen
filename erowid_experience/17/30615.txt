I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and finally located some bright red A. muscaria this winter in early February. I was very cautious and took the time to carefully identify them. They are quite unmistakably red with white spots, just like in the fairy illustrations.



1st try: I ate a fresh, round, unopened cap (after washing it) of about 4 centimeters in diameter at about 7:00 p.m. I didn't notice much and went to bed at around 10:00 p.m. Surpisingly I had really rich and pleasant dreams that night, which was encouraging.



2nd try: The next day I ate 1/2 of an open cap about 9 centimeters in diameter at about the same time. Not much of a reaction. No special dreams or anything occurred.



3rd try: The next day I ate a whole mushroom, a washed, open cap about 10 centimeters in diameter along with about half of the stalk at around 3:30 p.m. This time I got a buzz which set on slowly from about 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. I don't know if it was cummulative from eating small amounts the prior two days or if the one I ate had more of the right molecules (I picked them all from the same area) but I definitely got high. By 8:30 I was kind of woozy and heavy feeling. It was hard to type, I kept typing more typos than usual. My hands felt a bit shakey. I wouldn't want to drive a car on this stuff, especially on more than I took, it makes me kind of uncoordinated. Usually I read a lot (I'm a college student) but I was enjoying the high too much and just wanted to drift, it sort of un-motivated me, but didn't totally blot me out. Definitely a sleepy, drowsy, but not a falling down sloppy high, with a good mood feeling. There were no visuals or nausea, but a sort of dizzy feeling, a nice feeling really but it definitely slowed down my mental sharpness. I found myself making mistakes in my reasoning and having difficulty finding the right words. I was slow, dreamy, in a really great, mellow mood though. It was sort of like a cross between drinking and marijuana, but not quite as dingy and forgetful as marijuana. 



I don't think I would want to take more than this small amount. The sensation was pleasant but I could see getting too dizzy. My breathing seemed to slow a bit too. The amount I took sort of made me sleepy, in a nice fuzzy sort of way. It feels good. It's a nice high. It's a stay at home, slow down, mellow, happy, lovey sort of high. I think setting is important with this drug (when isn't it?). I definitely wouldn't want to be at work on it.



In conclusion, I have to commend this plant. It made me feel nice at this dose. I certainly wouldn't want to overindulge in this substance, it does have a kick. I have cut off and dried some cap skins for smoking in a water bong. I will do a report on that experience in the near future.



A final note. Be sure to carefully identify Amanitas muscaria if you want to try it. The wrong mushroom, even some very close family members, can cause serious internal damage or even kill you. Try a low dose at first. It's a really nice high. Why screw up a good high by overindulging, puking and feeling bad? It's like the difference between having a nice glass of wine or two and drinking two bottle and vomiting. Stick with the former. These mushrooms certainly did not feel toxic but caused a pleasant high at the dosage I tried. Also, it's legal=)
