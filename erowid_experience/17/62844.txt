I had a bit of Ativan left over so I think the highest dose I took recreationally was 3 mg. it was pretty fun with the sedation and slight ataxia. I was at the psychiatric ward for bipolar for about 2 weeks for ultra rapid cycling bipolar.  I get very depressed and then very manic very quickly. Whenever I got depressed, they would give me 1 mg of Ativan and it did help me cope with the stress greatly. For about 2 years I've also been taking Trazodone 150mg at night for severe insomnia. 



At the hospital sometimes the Trazodone wasn't enough to help me sleep so they also gave me 1 mg Ativan at nighttime which worked great. When I was out of the hospital, I asked the doctor for a prescription of ativan to take home. So he gave me 30. For the next couple of days I would take them in the recommended doses for stress and depression but things changed. Lately every single time I would take an Ativan it induced EXTREME mania with psychotic symptoms. But it was strange because I had this sedating feeling as well. I was extremely hostile and mumbled and spoke to hallucinations. I've had mania like this before but after several days of taking Ativan a clear pattern showed up. Every single time I took even just 1 mg, I was severely manic the entire day. After the mania would come down I was left with extreme nausea and had to lie down to avoid vomiting.
