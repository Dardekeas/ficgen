When I was about 18 years old, I was just finally discovering who I thought I was. I never got along with many people but for some strange reason I ended up making a lot of new friends this year. I dont remember much of this experience because it was so long ago but I will tell what I do remember.



In my spare time I usually enjoyed art and tripping. I tripped on LSD for the first time this year as well, and did a lot of it.



A friend of mine, I'll call him J had just gotten some of what he called 5-meo-AMT. I had never tried it before, only LSD. I heard good things about it. I never really wanted to try mushrooms before but I was down for this new substance that so many people around me were really enjoying. I took a good dose (not sure how much but it should have been enough to trip from) Didnt work this time made me violently ill. The second time I tried it I did a little more than last time\ldots  Didnt work again and again began vomiting all night. I decided to try it again.



This time I took it in three different doses all in the evening. First J administered it to me, putting a small amount of this powder into a shot glass and I drank it. Didnt feel anything and about an hour had gone by, somebody else I will name B gave me some more and I still didnt feel it 45 mins later. J gave me some more and I finally started feeling it. They later told me I took a lethal dose\ldots  We will talk more about this later on\ldots ..



It started kicking in, I was sitting by a fire outside and it started flashing different colors. This was cool. I never had very interesting visuals from LSD so this is what I was enjoying. B lived by the highway, and the sounds of the cars started sounding like space ships. The sky was flashing different colors too. It was beautiful. J and I went down into the basement and talked, I drew for a little while and all of a sudden I began throwing up. It lasted for hours. I felt like my insides were outside of my body. I was in a lot of pain. I felt like I was dying. I couldnt stop throwing up and my body hurt so bad. Eventually I got comfortable with the thought of dying and let myself just go. I layed there with everything echoing and all the colors spinning, waiting until I would die. Somebody else in the house came downstairs his name was T, he wanted to give me some Xanax to calm down but I felt like if I did it would make things worse I didnt want anything else in my body. I respectfully declined it. I started to feel less nausea. J turned on some really large speakers and played with the feedback with the mic, he put on a ton of different effects too and it sounded so beautiful. All of the effects but in feedback. It was so awesome sounding. I was able to think for myself the whole trip which I liked.



It was then that I zoned out for god knows how long. I was completely lost in an auditory and visual time warp. After that we noticed that it was getting light outside and that it was morning. So we layed down and watched the sky. We talked about strange but awesome things like animal tails, I think we were talking about fluffy fox tails for a while. I started coming down for the most part. The trip probably lasted for between 12-15 hours. I had a good time, and I didnt die. And everything was so completely innocent and beautiful. I never did it again after that. I left afterward to go to my friends house. I was still tripping but barely. It was her birthday she had a big cook out. I made myself eat and that was it. It wasnt really a mind trip which I liked. It was just\ldots . Nice.
