+1 Minutes- My last hit\ldots  I know this because no more smoke is entering the chamber. I draw what is left and hold, I put out candle and brace for impact\ldots ..BOOM it hits, I start sweating extremely hard, dripping, I rip of my shirt and toss it to the side.



+2 Minutes- After pulling off my shirt and tossing it, I decide to lay back and cover my eyes with the pillow on my lap, the visions behind my eyelids consist mainly of geometrics, and some strange figures, like blank people. They lack everything that is matter, mere shades.



+4 Minutes- My visions are changing, I notice, I am able to look around the place that is forming around me. I now begin accelerating extremely fast,  hurtling through the stars, strange blobs and shapes, I wish I could have stopped and examined them closely as to find out what they were. I don't slow to a halt, it just halts, not vioently at all, I just stop moving. In front of me I am confronted by a being, someone of extreme importance, definitely female\ldots  Maybe a goddess of some lost culture and religion, from a time before time, like a time in between the inexistant place in-between time\ldots  She is a multicolored cosmic being, shooting beams of beautifully coloured light all seeming to go behind me, I do not look. She communicated with me, probably my sub-conscious as I understood nothing.



+9 Minutes- My visit with her is over now, and She is sending me off, before I knew it, I had gone in reverse in mere milliseconds, my visions back to geometricals nothing else.



+11 Minutes- After admiring the shapes dancing around me, and pondering what just happened for a bit, I decide it is time, the yopo has let go



I am now left with a strange feeling of enlightenment, but it wasn't my concious mind that was taught the secrets She held, but my subconcious. I now am left to wonder\ldots  Was it real? Would She ever call upon me to be her audience again? I don't know for  sure what happened, but I do know this\ldots  I have been taught something extremely important, and I am honored to be granted this knowledge, now I must go to sleep every night and attempt to extract what it was that She taught me\ldots  Maybe one day, I will know.
