My experience with 2ct2 was relatively unremarkable. i took 40mg of the stuff. About a half hour in, without any warning whatsoever, i had to vomit; shortly after that, i was feeling fine again. A half hour later i was finally starting to feel the effects. The effects were mostly visual to me: the room became very soupy, and i was able to play with the trails in the air in a very tangible way. Psychologically, meanwhile, i wasn't particularly stimulated by the experience; it was weird in a very undramatic fashion, but provided no particular `content' that i could find. It seemed to me, after later getting a chance to try 2ct7, that 2ct2 was a `wannabe' version of 2ct7, only without quite as much good clean fun buried within it, and for me at least, a significantly higher body load. The effects lasted maybe 5 hours or so, and then all the next day, i had a pounding headache, as did a companion who took 24mg of the stuff. 



i have since heard tell that combining low doses of 2ct2 with 2cb is a very worthwhile experience.
