At an outdoor party last summer, i was offered some ketamine which i accepted. I was already high on about 300-400 mcg. of lsd and this i am sure had an effect on the outcome of the experience. My friend and i snorted two large lines of uncut ketamine powder\ldots and the following experience was of galactic importance, at least for me. 



After about five to ten minutes i was almost immediately in a world where i was part of a whole\ldots my thoughts were but a small piece of the great  collective thought\ldots every thought i willed was part of a larger domino effect of others' thoughts\ldots hard to explain\ldots things became weirder.  i was a disembodied point of consciousness caught up in a cosmic puzzle\ldots i was at the point where life is created from nothing(?)\ldots warbling its way into existence\ldots we (me and everyone i sensed around me) were all part of some big happening\ldots almost willing the world into existence\ldots after swirling and morphing movements and thoughts, which would be felt and relayed by the greater whole into a final end\ldots it was almost as if i could only do my very small part and just rely on the others to do their's\ldots which i would feel as being jolted around in the large ball of consciousness i was caught up in\ldots a very heavy very real experience.  About half an hour(?) into the trip, the whole project had moved to the point that the whole thing we were trying to accomplish rested on my shoulders\ldots it could succeed or fail depending on my actions in the next few seconds\ldots it was all about getting through a hole which you just couldn't quite make it through\ldots it was amazing how at the moment we succeeded\ldots i was thrust back into the physical world in the middle of the woods just as the sun peeked its head over the morning horizon\ldots amazing\ldots we had done it\ldots .and i was\ldots i was I WAS JEREMY\ldots wow, what a concept, i was a person, how totally fucking mindblowing\ldots i had no idea of this\ldots but here i was.  I found my tripping partner who was in a similar state of dazzlement\ldots and this is where the real fun happened\ldots the experience was of the world feeling me, instead of me feeling the world\ldots everything\ldots the air, everything was pure evergy which i could morph and be morphed by using my whole body\ldots as we moved closer together our consciousnesses sort of got caught up in one another's\ldots i was part of her and she was part of me\ldots we couldn't easily break the bond\ldots it was very hard indeed\ldots we were literally part of each other\ldots no matter how we worked together to get free\ldots every effort failed. We would almost have it, just to realise\ldots we were still trapped\ldots oh how i longed to be my own person again\ldots eventually the energy which had been feeling me all over my body made a rush from my toes and fingertips all the way to my head, leaving me to feel the world as one normally does\ldots this also set us free\ldots a very relieving event\ldots i could walk and run and think of my own free will.



This was a pretty heavy trip considering the amount and method of ingestion\ldots but i'm sure the energy of the party, the people, and the forest all related to this being a totally life-confirming experience.
