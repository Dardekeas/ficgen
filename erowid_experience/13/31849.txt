 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:ACETAMINOPHEN\#\# 

Just took 40mg of Oxyocodone in the form of Endocet 5mg/325mg pills.  I took 40mg 2 days earlier so I don't expect much from the 40mg I just took but I have plenty of Endocets at my disposal from my recent Wisdom teeth surgergy for which I got 30 pills for.  This is mostly an experiment to see how fast tolerance is built and goes down in a short amount of time like this.

11:35PM: Pills ingested on a empty stomach with a glass of water. Last meal was at 9:00PM which was a cupful of light noodle soup. NOTE: I've barely eaten anything in the last couple days due to the pain from surgery.

11:48PM: I think the Oxy is already kicking in, I didn't expect it to kick on so quick with my tolerance.  My face is feeling warmer and I'm starting to feel my body relax.

11:51: I'm starting to feel much warmer in my face and very relaxed. My mood has gone from normal to being much happier and cheerier outlook, I have no cares and just wanna sit around and do nothing. I'm already starting to get that Opiate Itchyness.

12:07AM:  The oxy hit me hard just now.  My head instantly felt like it was floating and I feel some loss of control of my limbs and typing is much more difficult.  I feel so relaxed and happy, I wish I could feel like this for the rest of my life.  It seems nothing could make me sad or uncomfortable except for the inevitable comdown which will come.

12:17:  The Oxy quickly leveled off and is staying at a nice high.  The body high is much more intense than the mental high.

12:40:  The Oxy has already started to slowly comedown because of my tolerance.  I still feel great and still got a good body high going.  I know the comedown is gonna get a little worse and I plan to overcome it with some Marijuana later on.

12:55:  I Didn't expect the oxy to wear off this fast its going down pretty fast but I'm not feeling like shit or anything just kinda upset that it didn't last longer. Well I'm gonna go grab my pot and pipe now and smoke some.

1:30AM:  I am smoking some marijuana right now and I've only taken about 8 hits and it has actually increased the effects of the oxy quite a bit and the oxy has increased the high of the weed. It's a really good combo, I got the good weed mental high but with the great oxy body high, And the weed has given me some energy so I'm not so tired from the oxy.

2:01AM:  Well most of my energy is gone now and I feel really relaxed and peaceful but also getting pretty tired. I think I may eat a snack then off to bed. Its been a great night and I'm glad it turned out the way it did.
