Well, nobody has tried this yet, so\ldots 



8:50PM

------

        I weigh out 6mg of 5-MeO-DIPT, chop it up into fine powder, and

divide it into two lines of approximately 3mg each. I divide each of these

in 2 again.



8:53PM

------

        1.5mg up one nostril, 1.5 up the other! The smell/taste is similar

to DPT - or any other tryptamine for that matter. I'm glad that 5-MeO-DIPT

has a very low dosage range\ldots  it would not be pleasant to insufflate

large quantities of this. I have an immediate sense that `something' is

coming, but the effects are not instantaneous.



8:58PM

------

        Yuck! The drip from this stuff tastes very bad, and also is giving

a very uncomfortable burning sensation in the back of my throat. Neither

saline nasal spray nor drinking seems to help. I guess I just need to wait

it out.



9:05PM

------

        I am beginning to feel a tryptamine lift, and the bitter burning

taste in my throat is subsiding.



9:20PM

------

        The taste in my throat has cleared up, and I'm definately feeling

the effects now. At this point, its still fairly mild, and feels like what

I would expect from the same ammount done orally. I wonder if it will

build any more, or if I should do some more? I decide its best to wait

another 10 minutes or so, just in case.



9:30PM

------

        I'm feeling a rather good effect. I seem to have reached a plateau

now. It feels slightly stronger than this dose would orally - but not by

much. I feel warm, trippy, and happy. I have very mild visual enhancement

(bright colors etc), like I would expect from a low oral dose of

5-MeO-DIPT. The time it took from insufflation to peak effect was roughly

25-30 minutes. I think a little more will do nicely. 2 lines of 1.5mg each

are still on the plate, I think one of them is in order - if not both\ldots 



9:40PM

------

        I insufflate one of the 1.5mg lines.



9:50PM

------

        Fuck it. Up with the other 1.5mg!



10:02PM

-------

        This route seems to be about co-effective with oral. Same dosage

range (though maybe insufflated is SLIGHTLY more efficient). Similar

subjective effects, although this seems a little more energetic, and it

hit alot faster. The neck tension and jaw clench seems a little less

prominent. There is no trace of stomach discomfort. This is a very clean

experience compared to my oral experiments with 5-MeO-DIPT. This is an

exceedingly comfortable place. This feels like wrapping up in a warm fuzzy

blanket in front of a fire on a winter night.



10:32PM

-------

        Ahhh\ldots  very nice. The last few lines are fully kicked in. I am at

a very solid +2. Warmth, a nice tryptamine body high, a relaxed and mellow

mindset. Some mild visual enhancements and perhaps even hits of OEVs

scurrying past the corners of my eyes. I feel like going to lay down and

relax and think for a while.



11:00PM

-------

        Wow. Laying on my couch and listening to my fan was amazing. A

timeless sense of relaxation and bliss. Thinking contentedly about life.

Everything is good. I feel very introspective, in a warm fuzzy way. Again,

the sensation is similar to the coming down phase of a very good LSD trip.

I do feel that I am lower down now than I was a half hour ago, however. A

few quick tokes of cannabis, then off to lay down for a few more minutes.



11:11PM

-------

        I'm unable to return to that warm, floaty place. I seem to be

coming down a good deal now. I am still quite high but the mental effects

are now taking a back seat to the purely physical sensation of

tryptamineness. The bright colors are still very prominent. But the peak

effects are beginning to subside. I feel I've still got a long glide down.



11:50PM

-------

        I'm a little lower than I was. Its very hard to judge how far you

have come with this substance. Its very difficult to tell if I'm feeling

less effect than a half hour ago, or to tell what effects have dissipated.

But I know that I am alot further towards baseline than I was a half hour

ago, nevertheless. I did notice a sort of laxative effect just now - an

increase in peristalsis, rather. Perhaps the stomach effects of oral doses

are not just because of chemical irritation of the stomach or intestine,

but also due to some sort of neurological process? Perhaps it is

interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain stem. Its a non-issue

though. There was no discomfort whatsoever. This was a far cleaner

experience than oral\ldots  except for the bad tasting drip. I think I will be

using this route more than the oral route, despite my usual aversion to

snorting things. Its just a cleaner trip this way.



12:30AM

-------

        I'm pretty far down now. Could probably sleep without too much

effort now. This experiment exceeded my expectations quite a bit.
