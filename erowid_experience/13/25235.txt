ï»¿MJ Brownie Experiment



What are the effects of eating pot?



Start Time is 9:15 p.m.  (7/12/03)



Control:



I weigh $\sim$135 Pounds (60.25 kg)



No THC in my system for at least a year!



No drugs in my system in the last week (caffeine, DXM, aspirin, etc.)



I have a completely empty stomach!  I ate last at 2:30 p.m. this afternoon.



I will list my feelings every fifteen minutes until I really feel heavy effects (if I

do\ldots)



I know the diazepam is against the rules to control this experiment, but this is for

my own good and I can distinguish the different effect of the two drugs/highs



My recipe for an identical experiment is as follows\ldots



Stuff you need:



	1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped

	4 Tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, softened 

	Â½ Cup sugar

	1 egg

	Â¼ Cup all-purpose flour

	Â½ Teaspoon of vanilla extract (for taste)

	Around Â½ oz of herb, depending on the strength you want

        your brownies.



Process:



1.)  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a   cupcake pan

     that makes 4-6 cupcakes (depending on how large you

     want the brownie.

2.)  Combine the herb and butter in a small saucepan over

low heat, stirring frequently.  When the butter and bud have heated up for awhile (just a few minutes) add your

chocolate and let that melt and continue stirring.  After

everything is blended remove the mixture from the heat.

3.)  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the sugar. 

Than beat in the egg.  Gently stir in the flour, salt, and

vanilla.  Pour and scrape the mixture into the cupcake

pan about 2/3 full on each one.  Put the brownies in the

oven for 20-25 minutes and check periodically to see if

the middle of the brownies is set with a toothpick.  Let

them cool on a rack, outside, in the refrigerator, etc. 

They stay good a few days and make about 4 brownies.

4.)  The brownies will take about 30 minutes to kick in on an empty stomach.  Eat one every 30 minutes and you should be out for the night within 3 hours!



NOTE:  The smell of bud shouldn't flow out of the oven, but it smells pretty bad in the oven, but not anything you'd expect from pot.  I actually though I got a contact buzz while cooking it, but really it turned into a headache.  (not pleasant)



9:15 p.m. -  I ate one Brownie Cake that contain $\sim$1/9 oz of commercial bud.



9:30 - I took 10 mg of Diazepam to control my anxiety while stoned.  (I seem to have a problem with paranoia)  Also, my parents are up stairs, so in case I get super baked I won't get scared! Believe it or not, I actually feel a buzz coming on from the magic brownie!  It is nothing like the coming up while smoking, it seem to affect how my body feels (in a good way!).

     

9:45 - Nothing much different, It seems that I am totally normal around my parents because I'm not flying to the peak as you do while smoking.  This is a real benefit to a person in a social setting, but I still don't know for

sure how high I will reach tonight.

     

10:00 - Still not much has changed; I think I feel different (you get the point).  I am eating another brownie that contains $\sim$1/9 an oz of bud.  I also consumed another 5 mg Valium pill.

     

10:15 - I'm starting to feel like I'm moving up fast, my first brownie must be kicking in. I feel baked already, I can't believe that it hit me so hard in just 15 minutes between 10:00 and 10:15.  I noticed that there is a weird body high that I don't normally experience while smoking.  I feel heavy and feel stuck to my chair I don't even want to move right now.  Walking feels weird, kind of like the Robo walk from a DXM trip.  I feel mentally clear, and this doesn't happen by smoking either!  I am excited of what is next!

     

10:30 -	I am toasted right know I had to lead my friend through the process to log on the internet, and I didn't ever care that I was baked (I believe this is mainly the diazepam that eliminated my paranoia.)  I feel like I am stoned in a more calm way, so you can easily control your self in situations that normal smoking would leave you unprepared.  My mind is a little cloudier and find myself getting off task easily, and looking around a lot.  Typing is harder now, it seems that when if I think about what I am trying to write than it seems harder, so I just let my thoughts flow.

     

Nothing below is proof read for errors to show my intoxication level.

     

10:45 -	The normal Marijuana smoking effects are beginning to show up.  These include the ``munchies'', and ``cotton mouth''.  A real intoxicating body high is present.  I feel like I am pulling my legs along, that is similar to being drunk.  I think the THC and Valium are a synergistic mixture.  I feel so relaxed, and kind of like passing out.  I used the delete key about 50 times during this paragraph, and I skipped a lot of words that belong in the sentence in the way I thought it out.  It is now 10:50 after I completed this journal entry.

     

11:00 -	I am blown out of my mind, I feel all the normal effects with smoking herb, but with eating it acting normal is hard, you just need to go with the flow!  I feel baked, but I still have half stash to eat, so I hope it is cool.  I forgot to mention that trip properties of bud are now beginning to show, I am too fucked up to go in front of my parents without any trouble.

     

11:15 -	I am stuck in the chair in front of my computer.  I tried to get up, but I felt like my but was glued down to it.  I walked around and my vision is blurry like the beginning of a 2nd plateau DXM trip, but I fell like I am swaying around.  A lot of the movements I make seem to be done without thinking they flow together.  Typing is easy if you don't have to think about what you are writing, or I always screw up my wording.

     

11:18 -	I feel like passing out for awhile.  Totally blown, not like the time I smoked Â¼ oz last year.  (It took me over 6 minutes to right this sentence!)

     

12:00 - I'm having closed eye visuals, ones that you don't get from

smoking, I really enjoy eating the buds more because of the high, and I hate the feeling in your mouth while you smoke.

     

Sunday 9:00 a.m.

     

I still feel different; I have the same feeling of when I began to feel the brownies last night.  I remembered that while I was sleeping I felt a buzzing sensation throughout my entire body.  My vision was buzzing/blinking slightly also.  It was a slight trip while I was laying on my bed, nothing intense enough to scare anyone, but I never finished the entire Â½ oz, only a Â¼.  I saved the rest for my DXM trip tonight.  I kind of regret taking too much diazepam because I passed out before the peak of the experience, but even before my peak the experience was very intense and nothing like smoking pot! I feel like moving around a lot when I smoke pot, but while eating it I just want to chill in one spot and not do anything!

     

11:30 -	I feel like I have a little hangover, or maybe because I need to eat.  It was from the 15 mg of Valium I should have stayed with five or ten.  (I only weigh 135)  I was actually planning on doing 600 mg of DXM tonight, but I might not be able to if this headache lasts all day.  Just smelling my last two brownies makes me want to puke!
