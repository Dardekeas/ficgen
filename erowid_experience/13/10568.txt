One time I used MDA with a lover to help us decide if we were going to stay together or whether she would return to an old lover who was open to her returning. We did the MDA at night on my sundeck. We had a wonderful time together. Our conversation was punctuated by lots of long silences as we thought about our feelings for each other and the crossroads we were at.  During these silences, the most amazing thing happened.



The night sky became the foreground rather than the background. In other words, the passage of the stars across the sky was our major focus, we were simply observing the quiet movement of time and space in all its magnificent awesomeness.  Our comments to each other, our very lives, were the background to the celestial majesty.  During the night, it became clear to both of us that she and her previous lover would make a more appropriate pair than the two of us.  That was about 15 years ago. She married him and they are still together, she and I are very close friends, and he and I like and appreciate each other.



MDA gave us a night of grace.
