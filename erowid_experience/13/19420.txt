Alright, well I had been taking the ephedrine for a couple days now, I had purchased a couple bottles of `Ephedra' and had been using it the last few nights. Now, each pill contains 1000mg of Ephedra, which equals out to 8mg of ephedrine.



The first night, I took 2 pills (16mg), and it made me feel nauseated for the first half hour, after that I felt very tired so I went to sleep, as there wasn't any greatly noticable effects.



The second night, I ingested 3 pills (24mg), and basicly the same happened as the first night, though I forced myself to stay awake. The nausea passed, and so did the tiredness. I started to have mood swings, and I felt very relaxed, at no time did I feel any more energy then I currently had, mostly the opposite, actualy.



Third night, I go over to a friends and we both ingest 3 pills (24mg), we start searching around his room, untill we came across 2-3 roaches, which we emptied into a pipe and smoked, it was only a minimal amount and I don't think it made a difference. My friend started getting a bladder movement, followed by bladder pain, and said he urinated some blood, which made me edgy though I wasn't feel to bad at all, quite relaxed.



We went for a walk and had a smoke, walked around looking for someone to sell us some product. It turns out you `dont' want to mixed nicotine with ephedrine :| I started feeling sick, and started having anxiety attacks, followed by heart palpulations.



at first I thought I was going to have a heart attack, everytime the anxiety hit I felt as though my heart had stopped, I kept getting a weird body buzz at random locations in my body, which I thought to me lack of blood. The anxiety and heart palpulations lasted 8 hours total, I took some pepto bismal to prevent any nausea and I luckily fell asleep. When I woke up I was feeling better, with just cramps.



In conclusion, From what I've read Ephedrine can be a very risky drug, combinations with other substances of any kind can most likely have negative effects. I'd never do it again, and because of this experience I am contemplating whether or not taking chems again.
