About 1 month ago I was prescribed Adderall for low heart rate. My feeling is that it has changed my life for the better. The drug has no only helped me get through school but gave me a new perspective on life.



Prior to my daily use of Adderall I was constantly falling asleep in school and dependant on caffeine to keep me awake during some classes. I was failing out of my subjects and ruining my life and crushing my dreams of going to a good college. Only to my doctor prescribed me Adderall for a low heart rate.



The affects were almost immediate. My grades went up, my family life was a bit better, and I have a sense of accomplishment now. For the most effective use, I woke up 20 mins earlier than normal only to take the 10mg dose. This makes it easier to wake up and get out to school in the morning. During school I'm awake and attentive. I'm also better at understanding of difficult topics. The effect wears off at about 4pm and I start at 630am. That means the duration of the medication's effect with time release is about 9 1/2 hours. I did not use Adderall on the weekends. I believe it is essential not to use it on the weekends for optimal use.



The only downsides of the drugs usage, which hardly matter, are that on the first week of the dosage I felt depression and anxiety when I was coming off of it. It only lasted one week. The next week I felt a diminishing affect but it went back to normal, less the first week's side effects. There was once a good 5 minutes that I had closed eye visuals. But on the third weeks beginning, the effects were positive and beneficial. Also, I got a positive mood towards life and living.
