I'm writing because I might help someone avoid having to go through the hassle that I went through with my probation officer. I tested positive for amphetamines after taking DXM a couple days before.



My urine tests are not done at a lab.  My p.o makes an appointment for me to come to the courthouse, then she gets a male probation officer to supervise me while I urinate in the cup.  After this the male probation officer himself tests it with dipstick drug tests name branded `test-stiks.



I usually get tested for THC, cocaine, amphetimines,and opiates each of these tests is an individual 'Test-stik' they work pretty much like a pregnency test if a blue line shows up your positive for that drug.  When the P.O told me I was dirty for amphetimines I was baffled.  I had not done ectasy in about a year and a half and I dont mess with speed.



The only things I had been doing since I had gotten on probation were small amounts of marijuana, large amounts of alchohol, and DXM fairly often.  About 1 or 2 days before my test I had taken about 14 coricidin cough and colds ( I know there bad for you!\ldots  thanks to this web site! ).  I told my p.o that the test must be wrong and that I would gladly re-do it so she told me to come back in 2 days, when I re-did it I was clean.  So i guess the time period is 2-4 days but im not positive.
