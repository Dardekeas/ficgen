When I first tried MJ, my friends said nothing would happen to me, I would just laugh. This was true, I laughed a ton for about 10 minutes. Then somebody who was with me asked for my phone number. He gave me a pen and paper, but when I tried to write, I couldn't move my hand. I lost complete function of my left hand. After about an hour I was able to write again, and in the meantime, I couldn't feel my legs (yea like in the movies). 



The second time I tried MJ, my friends had constructed a gravity bong out of a 3-gallon arrowhead water bottle. The burn chamber was a 5/11 socket wrench piece. He lit me a huge GB hit, and I couldn't finish all of it. I held it in for about 3 seconds when I let out a gigantic cough. I ran over to his toilet cuz I thought I was gonna vomit. I didn't puke and I was ready for another hit. Taking a second hit, I didn't cough nearly as much and held it in for about twice the time. I sat on his couch for about only 1 minute before I felt it. 



Holy crap. All of a sudden I heard a high-pitch noise, which I identified as the whine most TV's make. My body felt like it exploded. All 5 of my senses were boosted, especially feeling. I could feel every molecule in my body. This was great except I was afraid to stand up. Then all of a sudden my heart-rate skyrocketed. I lost complete control of my body, and began to get scared. My friend said `grats bro you're high'. I said cool but I was not cool. It was fucking scary for about 2 hours while I was super-zonked. 



After about the 2 hour mark, though, I gained back control of my body. At the same time, time itself was distorted for me. The next 4 hours seemed only like a few minutes. Life itself became a slide-show with only 1 frame out of 1000 registering in my brain. 



At about this time my second high had ended.



During later experiences I had started to get bored with MJ. All until one time when I decided to focus more on my high instead of people around me. This was amazing. I set my mind into a positive state repeating `I am in complete control of my high, and I can affect it in any way.' Suddenly I felt my body explode just like my second high experience. It was like smoking out for the first time all over again. I read about people on acid trips and how they imagine their body shrinking and expanding. Immediately after thinking about this, I felt tingling on the very top of my head. The tingling then turned into an intense vibrating. I touched the top of my head and then all of a sudden my body felt like a sword was splitting my body in half starting from the top. This was very cool, as it felt my body was split perfectly in half, and separated by about 6 inches of empty space. After my body `melted' back together, I wondered if I could distort myself in any other way. I saw a physics book, and on the cover was the infinity sign. I then began reading about black holes and how they were infinitely small. My body all of a sudden started to feel like it was being sucked into a black hole, centered in my stomach. I put the book to my side and let myself shrink into an infinitely small space. I couldn't let myself get out of this state of infinite smallness, but then I remembered reading about supernovas in the physics book and then my body felt like it exploded just like a supernova.



Since then, I try to duplicate these situations whenever I smoke out, but It usually takes a decent amount of dank smoked in a GB.
