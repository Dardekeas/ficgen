12:50AM

-------

        OK, so its actually the 18th now. So what. I haven't gone to sleep

yet, so its the 17th as far as I'm concerned. Anyway\ldots 

        I have 2.5 tablets of Propacet, each containing 50mg of 

dextropropoxyphene. They're the last of a batch of 8 of them that I was

given. I ingest all of them. I had smoked a little cannabis earlier, still

feel a lingering effect, but am close to baseline.



1:09AM

------

        I begin to feel a hint of opiate feel kicking in. I also seem to

be feeling random itches all over my body, but they are easy to ignore.

This is a typical opiate alert for me. I feel slightly warm, a little

`floaty,' and real calm. Not much else yet. Narcotics seem to take a long

time to take effect orally.



1:21AM

------

        The itching passed several minutes ago. But other than that, there

has been no change. I almost even feel closer to baseline than at my last

check-in. I'm yawning a little now though.



1:45AM

------

        Well, I definitely feel `something' - basically the same as I have

been feeling, but its moved up a level of intensity. Its tempting at this

point to smoke some cannabis to bring on the effects. I'm holding off

though, so I can get a good description of an unclouded dextropropoxyphene

experience. But damn\ldots  this slow come on time is a negative in my

opinion. I would hate to have to wait this long if I were using it for

pain relief!



2:10AM

------

        T+1:20 and it still hasn't really kicked in yet. This is taking an

unusually long time. I haven't eatin in 11 hours or so, so my stomach

wasn't full. I feel slightly more than I did at last check-in. Same

effects again, just a little stronger. A kind of warm tingly sensation

diffused throughout my upper body and somewhat in my legs. A feeling of

calmness. Somewhat quieted thought processes. But I'm not yet feeling the

euphoria or the `buzz' yet.



2:15AM

------

        As I typed that last paragraph, things did jump up a level. The

body tingles increased alot, and spread all over my body. There is some

tinnitus in my ears now. Every now and then I get random itches, which has

been going on since I felt the first hint of effects. I'm developing a

decent `buzz' and some euphoric sensations now as well. 



2:30AM

------

        Things still seem to be building, but I'm at a pretty decent level

now. I feel typical opiate effects, though sort of mild. As I said,

narcotics are very different from other CNS depressants. Its hard to

compare this high to something like GHB or alcohol.

        I feel a little warm, its a pleasant warmth. My body feels a sort

of tingly, floaty sensation. I feel much lighter than usual. I don't feel

like moving around at all. I tried to lay down, though, and that wasn't

noticably more comfortable than sitting in my computer chair or standing.

It doesn't seem to matter what position I'm in, I'm equally comfortable.

Its a comfortableness that seems to come primarily from not caring about

things that might normally make me uncomfortable. My thought processes are

slow\ldots  I'm a verbal thinker, and the voice in my mind is much quieter

than normal. Its not that thought is impaired, I *can* think if I want

to\ldots  it just seems nicer to not think though. Opiates are a very

detatched high. You just want to float around feeling calm, not doing or

thinking. Its not that you feel unusually happy - you just feel mentally

relaxed and physically good. Personally I find it sort of boring, but I

can see how this state would appeal to alot of people, especially those

with escapist tendencies. Music is slightly enhanced. Orbital's `Halcyon

On \& On' sounds prettier than usual, and goes well with the floaty

sensations. Other minor effects\ldots  I have dry mouth, but its different

than cannabis `cottonmouth.' I was pretty hungry before I took the pills.

The hunger vanished within a half hour or 45 minutes or so and hasn't

returned. The itching is still somewhat there, but its so easy to ignore

as to be a non-issue. Its concentrated on my scalp, face and arms now,

though, whereas earlier it was all over. My juice tastes bland.



2:50AM

------

        Its been 2 hours\ldots  peak plasma concentrations of

dextropropoxyphene are supposedly reached at 2-2.5 hours, and I do feel as

though I've gotten as far as I'm going to. There doesn't seem to be

anymore sensation of increase in the effects. I'm kind of bored of the

high already. Narcotics just don't do all that much for me on their own.

I've been wanting to smoke some cannabis, but haven't yet because I wanted

to write an accurate report of an unclouded narcotic high. I think I've

accomplished that.



3:00AM

------

        I smoke some cannabis. One hit from my glass pipe and I'm already

feeling much nicer. Yes, I think this is what was needed.



3:15AM

------

        The cannabis made a huge difference. I can feel the effects of

both blended into a fuller high than the dextropropoxyphene alone. The

cannabis also made me think more vocally again, and the combination makes

mellow music AMAZING! It is making me a little sleepy though. Neither drug

seems to dominate the high, its an even synergy, at least at these

dosages.



3:45AM

------

        I feel much the same as before, but the narcotic aspect of the

high is starting to taper off ever so slightly. I'm pretty tired and plan

to go to bed soon. This was interesting to actually document a narcotic

experience, but I've never really been a big fan of this class of drug.

I'd definitely do it again if I was given some more, although I'd combine

it right off with cannabis. Ah well\ldots
