After reading several reports about IAP I decided to give the substance a try.  The reports I read varied, describing it from totally a waste of time and money to slightly resembling MDMA in some aspects, but in a very mellow and minor sort of way.  Me and my girlfriend, `G', headed out to an outdoor, underground house music event in the forest.  We planned to try IAP for the first time there.  I had dissolved the powder in vodka earlier and we both took a 30mg dose.  



I began to feel the effects about one and one-half hours after ingesting.  It came on closely resembling coming up on a low dose of MDMA.  First a slight increase in mood and some enjoyable smiling.  Then some mild tingling of the body and a slight relaxing feeling.  When I first noticed these effects they were so mild I was unsure whether it was simply due to the combined effects of the party atmosphere (which always puts me in a good mood even without the use of any substances), the one beer I had drank, and the hooka I was smoking from (I rarely smoke tobacco so it does give me a little buzz some times.)  Over the period of the next half hour I noticed these feelings kind of coming and going, similar to how MDMA's peaks come in `rolls.'  These effects also did increase slightly over this period of time, although not a whole lot.  I also felt a very mild and enjoyable feeling of stimulation and I was inclined to talk a bit more than I would normally.  These effects came and went over the period of the next 3-4 hours yet they continued to be very mild.  



To put it simply it really did feel like the first little bit of euphoria and happiness I first feel as MDMA starts to kick in, but just prolonged over a period of several hours without increasing in intensity.  So it was very much of a tease, feeling like I should start rolling balls at any moment but knowing I wasn't going to because I wasn't on MDMA.  Some other effects I felt were an increased appreciation for the music and a need to groove to it, and it did give me enough energy to dance fairly hard which was extremely enjoyable (but I like to dance even when I am sober, IAP just made it even more fun.)  



One effect I found unusual was at one point I got the munchies which I thought was odd since I was on a stimulant.  Luckly `G' had prepared and brought a huge fruit salad.  Oh, my gosh, food had never tasted so good!  It wasn't like marijuana or GHB munchies where I just get really hungry.  Food tasted outstanding.  



At the t+3:00 I took a 20mg booster dose.  This didn't seem to increase the effects much at all except for the stimulation which it made seem dirtier and less enjoyable, more like and tryptamine stimualtion than an amphetamine stimulation.  At about t+4:00 the effects started to wane anyhow except for the slightly upleasant stimulation, even though I was starting to get tired and began yawning alot.  This lasted about another three hours until I was able to get to sleep.  I must also note, as has previously been noted in another report, alcohol really did seem to potentiate the effects quite bit, although they were still mild I just felt the smiles and tinglies a little more often.  I can only imagine what it must be like combine with GHB.  (Oh, if only it wasn't so totally impossible to find nowadays.)  Anyhow, I would try this again, but it would have to be at another party because I think the experience would be totally boring at home.  Without loud music, dancing, and plenty of people to talk to the effects of IAP are not potent enough to be enjoyable in and of themselves.  



`G''s  experience was quite different she said she felt little to no effects besides some nausea, slight stimulation, a mild LSD-like lockjaw/perma-grin, a feeling of contentness and minor increase in mood, and about 15 minutes of a single open-eye visual pattern covering the entire landscape.  `G' says she would like to try it again at a higher dose in hopes of an experience similar to mine.
