It's T + 14:20 and I managed to pull off a less than spectacular trip on 25mg of AMT.  How did I manage to not enjoy myself on a drug whose claim to fame is its guarantee of a good time?  I tried to control it, and it taught me a lesson.



Don't get me wrong; I didn't have a ``bad trip''.  I've experienced what I would consider ``the worst kind of trip possible'' on a 9 gram dose of morning glory.  No, it was more like just a flat-out bad day.  Let me take you through my experience so that you don't make similar mistakes.



Inspired by a few reports I read raving about the benefits of an early morning solo trip, I got it into my head yesterday that I would dose at 6AM this morning.  It's important to note that I've taken AMT twice before and both times were at this same dosage.  Both of those times I had done it with friends and had an excellent time.



Last night I had a calculus test at 8PM (I'm a first year college student).  I was fatigued, and prior to the test I took a caffeine pill.  I'm not a regular soda or coffee drinker and that kind of dose was enough to keep me up until 4AM.  Being the stubborn (stupid) kid I am, I decided against putting off the AMT trip until later in the week because I figured the speedy effect of the AMT would counteract my lack of sleep.  I woke up at 6AM, hopped out of bed and drank down the small amount of powder in a glass of OJ.  



30 minutes later I was buzzing pretty hard and my eyes were dilated.  Some people refer to the come-up on AMT as a roll on X, but for me it seems like the onset of X.  I never get to that point of really rolling.



I looked up on the web that the sunrise was at 7:10, and since I'm usually not up at that time, I decided to walk Â¼ mile or so to my car (it was really cold out and I wanted the heat), which was sitting out in a parking lot.  This would give me a good view of the sunrise and an opportunity to smoke a cigarette, which I love to do on this substance.  At 7:20 I was sitting in my car and I noticed that it was pretty light outside already, but the sun was nowhere to be scene.  A couple seconds later something caught my eye in the rear view mirror.  It was the sun.  I had been looking out to the west and missed the sunrise.  I am truly a dumbass.  



Well, that was depressing.  I listened to some tunes out in the car and noticed that I felt pretty epithetical but depressed.  I also began to feel some nausea at this point.  I got back to my room at around 8 and watched some TV, making sure to keep myself hydrated.  I then listened to some music until around 11, when the visual part of the trip kicked in.  



I had some blurred vision, noticed that the carpet would roll in waves if I watched it long enough and had very very mild though shroom-like closed-eye visuals.  Probably the most fun I had all day was looking out of my window and letting the bright outdoors ``burn'' an image onto my eye.  Then, by closing my eyes very tight and then releasing the tension, the color of the afterimage change.  I don't know how to explain it but it was extremely beautiful.  I was also having periods of uncomfortable hot and cold sensations and my teeth felt odd in my mouth\ldots like they were extra-sensitive.  I started to feel very, very tired, something that never happens to me on AMT.  I went against every bit of good judgment I possess and took a caffeine pill.



At 12:30, peaking, I decided that I was up for going to my only class of the day, which happened to be calculus.  I got my exam back to discover that I received a good grade, which normally would have made my day, but was indifferent to it.  I walked home and spent the rest of the afternoon chatting with friends on the net, uncomfortable, bored, nauseated, worn out and spacey.



Why am I writing this now you ask?  Well, I supervise a computer lab on Tuesday nights.  That's right \ldots I didn't even consider how I would feel working an 8 to midnight shift, completely cracked out from no sleep and coming down from AMT with horrible jaw pain that just set in.  BLAH!  



Things I learned:

  

*Take AMT when I have 18 hours of free time open in my life.

*Take AMT with my friends.

*I shouldn't try to control the experience.  If it's not the right time, it's not the right time.
