Thursday night I picked up an 8ter of some bubblegums. I immediately went home and started smoking at about 10:30 PM. I smoked my first bowl (about 0.5 g.) and crushed up 1 Xanax (0.5 mg.) and swallowed it. I felt really adventurous at first so I decided to raid my parents alcohol cabinet. I poured myself a drink with about 4 shots in it and drank it. It went down very easily. In about 15 minutes the full effects of everything started kicking in, it was about 11.



I went to my room to lie down and started getting extremely scared that I was going to die from drinking and taking xanax it was intensified by the paranoia that I usually get while smoking. I decided to smoke some more. I packed two more bowls. I really started feeling the weed, I just collapsed on my bed and turned music on my ipod but I couldn't stay comfortable because whenever I put on the headphones I thought someone was at my door. I took off the headphones and sat in my bed very dizzy but with a heavy feeling of euphoria. I stared at one spot on the wall above me for about 15 minutes. 



During that time I thought about a wide variety of things. I asked myself questions about myself and came up with answers that sounded to me then like I was very wise but looking back on it the answers made absolutely no sense. I fell asleep soon after. The time was about 11:45. I locked my door and in the morning apparently it took me an hour to wake up but all and all it was a good experience and I would do it again but with a lighter amount of alcohol.
