A few weeks ago I received 28 grams of WA state Amanitas from an internet supplier.  I tried smoking the caps, which I found very enjoyable, but I wanted to wait until the right time to try a full dose. I prepared 1.5 caps in a tea; I boiled some distilled water and a few tablespoons of lemon juice, then turned the burner down so that it was just simmering and added the caps, broken up into small pieces.  I let them simmer for about fifteen minutes, until the water was a dark brownish-red, then added a few bags of Assam tea (a variety of Indian black tea).  I had hoped that the tea would mask the flavor, but unfortunately I suspect that it made it worse.  I ended up drinking a large glass (probably about 12-14 oz) of incredibly foul-tasting liquid - I had thought when people reported that it tasted like shit it was metaphorical.  I was wrong.  It also made my entire house smell like a sewer while I was cooking it. 



I started feeling a little queasy about halfway through the glass, so I smoked some cannabis and felt better almost immediately.  The last part was the hardest to get down because of the sediment. 



I started feeling the effects of the mushroom within 20-30 minutes.  It was a heavy, heavy body buzz at first, with very little mental impairment.  I used to be addicted to opiates, and it reminded me very much of morphine - needless to say I enjoyed it.  I laid next to my girlfriend and just sort of spaced out for a while.  She and the kids were watching some sort of fantasy movie, but I could make no sense out of it.  I kept having odd, irrational thoughts.  I recognized that they were not logical, but it was almost as if my mind was split in two; for example, I would ask myself `What if ducks could fly?', and the other half of my mind would answer `Ducks CAN fly', but the illogical part of my mind paid no attention.  Although I don't remember vocalizing it, my girlfriend told me that I asked her several times over the course of the night whether ducks could fly.



I have read that this sedative state is usually followed by a state that is considered more `psychedelic'.  I never progressed beyond the initial state, which was fine with me because I found it very pleasant.  I took the tea at about 7:00pm and fell asleep at about midnight, so maybe I just slept through it, or maybe I didn't take enough, or took too much.  Or maybe I react differently to Amanitas than most people.  I'm leaning towards the idea that I didn't take enough, simply because a lot of people complain about the unpleasant body load of Amanitas and I felt almost no physical side effects aside from a LOT of salivation.  Since I enjoyed the state produced so thoroughly, I may or may not experiment with higher doses - I don't really subscribe to the `More is better' theory ;)



Also, the next day I felt slightly hungover - nothing extreme like with LSD or other harsh psychedelics.  I had a headache, which is very unusual for me, and also some back pain, but both had gone away by 11:00am or so.  Overall it was not what I was expecting from Amanitas, but it was fun and I will do it again.
