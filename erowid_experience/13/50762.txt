Material - 20 mg miprocin (4-HO-MiPT) in a gelcap.  This is my second time using miprocin. 



Setting - A rock show, then my apartment.



Purpose - Entertainment and exploration.



+0 - I arrive at a rock show, and drop as the music starts. I eat it with a tastycake, but otherwise am on an empty stomach.



+0:30 - Tryptamine alerts, a little muscle tension.



+1:00 - Nothing much. I feel a little out of it, but that's it. I find this is kind of odd; miprocin normally comes on pretty fast.



+1:30 - Still not tripping\ldots  A little weird, that's it.



+2:00 - I finally hit a +2. +3 in 20 minutes. The show ends and I get some food and walk home. OEVs and mindfuck as per last experience. Something strange though: around the time I start tripping, very bad nausea starts to come on. The last trip I had, there was very little nausea, if any\ldots but now it is very obvious. I am very much reminded of the horrible feelings I experience of HBWR one week ago.



+3:00 - I get back to my apartment. Some friends stop over. Very sick still, it seems to be getting worse. Eating food does not help.



+4:00 - Still very ill. I separate from my friends and tell them I'm not feeling well at the moment. They leave except for one who is concerned about me.



+4:30 - The physical illness from this breaks me down and I start with the usual bad trip waterworks. My friend (the same one I'd phoned on HBWR) seems kind of upset, but tries to keep me sane. I can barely even talk for about a half an hour and just cling to him. I feel horrible that he has to help me through yet another bad trip. I take 12.5mg meclizine to try and deal with the nausea I am experiencing. My friend goes to bed on my couch.



+6:00 - I watch some movies and listen to some calmer music. I try not to think much about how much I am tripping. The nausea seems to be leaving some.



+8:00 - At a +1. Visual effects mostly gone. I go to bed.



--



This trip very much worries me; why did I get so sick? No one of my friends ever got nausea from this (same batch), and I really worry that my body is now associating the effects of psychedelics with my body being poisoned and reacting accordingly. Will I ever be able to enjoy a psychedelic again without intense physical trauma? I am kind of cautious now about taking another since all of this happened.



Also, I wonder why it took so long to come on? All my friends who took this from this same batch all were at peak by an hour and fifthteen or so.
