It was a balmy, rainy Sunday with a powerful thunderstorm brewing a few miles away, and I was sitting on a comfy couch at my friend Brett's house with 8 very good friends enjoying myself. 



First off, I used to be a fairly regular marijuana smoker, but stopped due to extreme Panic Attacks. When I used to smoke, I was taking Paroxetine (Paxil) for my anxiety and Lorazepam (Ativan) also for my Panic Disorder, along with my Singulair and Zyrtec for allergies and mild asthma. Usually, I reacted quite well on the scale of calmness. I really don't know if this is due to taking Paxil, but I also used to experience powerful hallucinations and amnesia. My friends told me that I often did crazy things such as running around the woods naked and stuff. I find it extremely funny that I did those things because as long as I didn't have a Panic Attack, I was fine. Those of you who have experienced a Panic Attack know exactly what I'm talking about. They're absolutely horrid. 



Anyway, I started smoking (taking a few hits a day) for the past week. Each and every time I experienced anxiety, and had a few Panic Attacks but controlled them through breathing exercises and stopping to meditate. What I'm currently doing is more of an experiment. I want to see if I can become used to marijuana to the point where I no longer experience anxiety or Panic, and feel calm. After that, I may or may not continue to smoke, I don't know. Anyway, today I experienced a Panic Attack that I was unable to control through breathing exercises and meditation. It was a slap in the face, heart palpitating, sweat-drenching, trembling and paranoia causing Panic Attack. I knew it was getting to the point where I was going to be out of control and start crying and hyperventilating extremely hard, so I finally intervened by insufflating Clonazepam (Klonopin). I am prescribed Klonopin (not prescribed to sniff it of course, but it's the second-fastest way of getting it into your system besides IV). 



I also take the medications Effexor, Wellbutrin, Zyrtec, and Singulair as listed above. It's possible Effexor had something to do with making my Panic Attack severe since I just started it two weeks ago and am having the `initial anxiety' of starting an SSRI. Actually, Effexor is an SSNRI, but it's similar. Panic attacks are very scary, so if you have an Anxiety or Panic Disorder, I suggest not smoking pot, and if you do, have a benzodiazepine on hand (Klonpin, Xanax, Valium) as a Panic intervention. It could just be me who reacted like that, and everyone's different. Take care.
