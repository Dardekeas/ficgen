Background:

I have been prescribed .5mg of Clonazepam for Generalized Anxiety Disorder/Panic Attacks. After about 3 months on the stuff, and reading all about the negative effects of long term use, I have decided I should stop my usage. For medical purposes, it may work for some, but it has not been effective on me in lower doses. For science, I decided to try to get a `high' off the pills before saying goodbye, since I have not experienced a high off it. I had only been taking it as prescribed (up to 1.5mg/24 hrs). Because I have been on them for an extended period of time, I knew my tolerance would be higher than someone popping the pills for the first time (as clonazepam does induce addiction and tolerance in long term use). 



Report:



The day of, I took one clonaz in the morning as prescribed, as my chest was very tight and I felt very restless and anxious. One clonaz will generally calm the symptoms of anxiety for a few hours for me. 



T0:00 I did not take any clonaz the rest of the morning or afternoon. I returned home from a day of running errands with no other obligations for the night. At around 8 pm, I orally ingested 4 .5mg tablets. I felt a faint `buzz' and slight head rush, followed by a soothing relaxation. These effects only lasted for a short time, and I blamed my tolerance (since I am prescribed to take up to 3 tablets a day).

 

T0:30 Seeking a more rewarding high, I took 2 more tablets. This seemed to boost the effects. I felt very warm and relaxed on the inside, and crawling into my warm bed felt amazing. Nothing in the world felt better than piling a huge amount of blankets on top of me, and feeling their softness and warmth. At this point I started to notice slight memory and dissociation problems. I went downstairs to grab a snack, and it felt as if I was in a dream. As if I was not actually there. Things were definitely processing slower in my brain, which may account for the dream like feeling. I remember running my hand over a chair in the kitchen and being surprised how `solid' it felt, as if I was expecting my hand to go right through it. 



 

T2:00 Still not satisfied with the high (I still felt very coherent), I took two more .5mg tablets. I may have also taken a 3rd but I do not remember. At this point my short term memory was struggling. Recollection of what I had just done became hazy, however I still felt very coherent in terms of motor skills. Typing this as I experience the high has not been difficult, I have not suffered any motor problems as of yet. 

 

T4:00 This is where it gets interesting. I decide to smoke a joint. It will be my last as I have a drug test coming up I have to sober up for. BUT. Back to the story. I roll a 1g joint that has a good amount of kief rolled into it. This joint takes me to the moon. The benzo high is truly brought out once I smoke the joint. I believe clonaz and weed together could be a therapeutic combo, if used properly and in moderation. I feel a very pure high, not drowsy or stupid. I start playing a game on Xbox with the sound coming through my headphones I have attached to the TV. The music in my ears gets me sucked into the game. I felt utterly relaxed and anxiety free, and can remember smiling at random moments during the game. As I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression, smiling is not something I do much, so it was very nice to feel loosened up. 





T5:00 After this point I do not remember much (thanks to the weed benzo combo). I went to my computer and read some things online and listened to music. The next thing I know I wake up 3ish hours later to the music still playing in my ears and my laptop still open, but I had fallen asleep sitting up. At this point the weed had worn off, but the calming benzo effect was still there. I turned off the laptop and went back to sleep. 



The next day I did not feel any major negative effects. I was slightly drowsy, I attribute this to the long half life of the Clonazepam, as it works longer than other benzos such as Xanax.
