Well, I never really thought much of this experience, until today I was browsing lycaeum.org and found that they added `Buspar' to their psychoactive vaults. So, I thought I might as well add this trip report, in case anyone was curious about what Busphar does.



First of all, some information about Buspar.

Buspar is pretty easy to get, doctors would gladly rather prescribe it for anti-anxiety than they would -zepam drugs and alprazolam, diazepam, etc. etc. Buspar is also prescribed to people who are quitting smoking.



Despite the fact that my last 3 trip reports that I sent to this site were not posted, I will remain un-daunted.



Mindset:

I just got the pills the period before (2nd period) and I had no idea what to expect, so I took 2.



Experience:

It took them about 25 minutes to kick in. I was reading and all of the sudden a shock wave went through me. I didn't know if it was the Buspar or not, but then another went through me, and more and more. I had a bit of a body buzz, nothing special.



Then, it was lunch time, I was not sure if I should eat or not, but I did anyway, I still had a slight body buzz, but nothing much. Then, I went to fourth period, and I had a terrible headache and I was nauseous, this finally went away fully about 5th period.



I gave away some tabs to some friends, and later that night, I cleared out the bag of them, another 2 15 mg tablets.



I ate these and smoked a bowl of weed, and listened to `Dark Side of the Moon' by Pink Floyd. When I went to go to sleep, I had a pleasant buzz going on and waves going through me.



My Thought:

Buspar isn't anything great at all, but if you do it, make sure you have some weed handy, it helps the buzz out alot.
