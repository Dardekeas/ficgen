This is a warning! I take Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), an SSRI prescribed for depression. SSRI is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor: it increases the levels of serotonin in your brain to reduce depression symptoms. This medicine has been VERY effective in curing my depression. The problem is, I have a long history of Tramadol abuse, which started when I was hospitalized about a year ago and was given it for pain. 

I had been taking Lexapro for about 3 weeks when I stupidly decided to indulge in some Tramadol. I only took 150mg (i usually take about 200-250).



The high was one of the best ones I've ever had, but that's not my point. The problem came the next evening, when I woke up in the middle of the night feeling really, REALLY, REALLY sick. I started shivering and in 3 seconds my ENTIRE BODY sweat so fast that I became completely soaked. I had diarrhea and threw up at the same time. I screamed for help and told my husband I was going to die. It is hard to describe how horrid of and experience that was. If you know what a bad trip on ecstasy is, (I've had one), multiply it by 100 and you have an idea of what I'm talking about.

I survived. The next day I did some research online on Tramadol interaction with SSRI and found out I had Serotonin Syndrome, an excess of serotonin in the brain that can be FATAL, so I DID almost die that night.
