I recently recieved an ounce of Wild Dagga from an online vendor. I had read some interesting reports on the substance online, and was anxious to see what effects smoking the plant produced.



Working with the substance is a bit difficult\ldots like its cousin, marihuanilla, the plant has small `thorns' within the flowers. With a little time I was able to pack a nice sized bowl. Unfortunately, the smoke does not taste very pleasant, and it is somewhat harsh on the lungs. It may be better to use a water pipe with this substance. On the bright side, I noticed a definite buzz. It sets in very quickly, and is similar to a marijuana buzz, but much milder with some opiate effects. It did seem difficult to sustain the buzz after a while.



In conclusion, I think this plant is a much better option than Marihuanilla. It has stronger effects and is a little easier to smoke. I would recommend smoking Wild Dagga with a water pipe. I also noticed that there is a resin extract available. Next time, I will order the extract.
