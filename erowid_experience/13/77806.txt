I began taking Naltrexone 5 weeks ago to enable me to moderate my consumption of alcohol. I have been a 2 bottle of wine a day drinker for the past three years. I am trying method whereby an alcoholic takes naltrexone one hour prior to drinking. The drinker still gets a `buzz,' but over a period of time -- generally 3-5 months -- the opiate receptors in the brain become `unwired' from addiction. This is supposed to result in the drinker being able to moderate, or halt, their drinking. 



My own experience has been: For the first week or two, I was more fatigued than usual. Shortly after taking the Naltrexone I experience prickling of my lower extremities. On occasion, within the first half hour of ingestion, I get what feels like a low sugar experience -- weak, sweating, somewhat dizzy and disoriented. This is relatively mild and passes in 15-20 minutes. Within a short time I'm back to normal. I intend to eat a high protein meal before taking the med to see if that helps.



So far I have not experienced the flat, listless or depressed feelings reported elsewhere. In fact, the opposite is true. I'm already drinking significantly less than I did when I started, down to an average of 6 glasses of wine per day, as opposed to my previous 10-12 glasses. I wake up feeling more alert and ready for the day. I've had one day with no drinking at all -- and didn't miss it. On the days of no drinking, naltrexone is not taken. So while I do have some negative side effects, they are nothing in comparison with the side effects of heavy, persistent abuse of alcohol.
