I have a good deal of experience with LSD and other mind-altering substances and have never once tried to intentionally stop a psychoactive with another medication.  This was my first time doing it, and the results were quite surprising.



T=0 I ingest 4 hits of quite strong LSD sublingually allowing them to move around for approximately 5 minutes before swallowing them.



T=2.00  I am having an excellent time, walking around in a park and eating ice cream, quite typical results from LSD, euphoria shifting distortions, time and perception change.



T=4.30  I realize I need to return home and wanting to discontinue my trip, I ingest 4 25mg pills of Seroquel which I had been prescribed about 7 months back.



T=4.45  My happiness is starting to get sucked away and is being replaced with feelings of fear and depression, the hallucinations/distortions  are even more pronounced and have taken on a less `intelligent magnitude'.  I am seeing large color shifts in reality of my surroundings and a physical body load is getting very pronounced, riding my bike is no longer safe and I start to walk it back to my house.



T=5.00  I feel like shit and am experiencing temporary black outs,  movement is difficult and everything seems to have taken on a `stupid' feel. Rather than having closed eyed visuals of fractal patterning mixed with mathematically irrational expressions, and exploded views of my mind with angelic tendencies, I now only see a single color.  Open eyed vision is heavily disrupted, yet my pupils have constricted back to what they would appear as when I'm sober.



T=7.00  Thank god the Seroquel's effects seem to be stopping, I still feel dumbed out, creative thinking is incredibly hard.



MORAL:  Seroquel did absolutely nothing to revert me back to baseline, although my pupils were no longer dilated.  I put a substance into my body I am in it for the long haul. I really hope they don't use this medication for people who are brought to the hospital suffering from intensely powerful trips.
