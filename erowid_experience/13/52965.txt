I always drank a lot of pop when I was a kid and loved staying up late.  Then, one day (I think I was 14), I was at the grocery store, and walking through an aisle of the pharmacy, noticed a package of caffeine pills.  I always knew of them, but never until that moment considered taking any myself.  I thought, `That would be nice.  As much caffeine as I need/want, whenever I need/want it.  Quicker than drinking a bunch of Mountain Dews.'  So I bought a pack of, I think sixteen 200 mg pills.



I took them one or two a day, and thought it kept me up well; I thought it was pretty cool.  So later, I bought a bottle (the first was in a foil-backed package) of forty 200 mg No-Doz.  I usually took two, on days that I took any; but sometimes upped to dose to three or four pills.  With four pills, I would get quite a buzz.  If I had been sitting down for a while, and then stood up, I felt really weird and dizzy--but in a good way.  I would have a ton of energy--physical energy, mental energy, creative energy, everything.



As my caffeine tolerance built up, three or four became the norm for a day, and every once in a while five or even six on rare occasions.  With that much, I kind of got a nauseated feeling, and a chalky taste in my mouth, and when I would breathe in through my nose, there would be a really strange kind of chalky smell.  It was really strange; it was not anything outside my body I was smelling.  But even with the weird sick feelings and smells and stuff, it gave me an even better buzz to take five or six, so I began to do this more often.  I also would kind of hallucinate, always thinking I was seeing things move really fast out of the corner of my eye, when nothing was moving at all.  Once, I was looking out the window at night, and stared at this big, motionless rock, and could not figure out whether it was a rock, or a cat moving around.



Then, early one day--sometime around getting home from school--I resolved that I was going to take a lot of caffeine that day.  I took four right off.  I sat around a while, not doing much, but buzzed.  Within a couple of hours, I took three more pills.  Started to feel pretty nauseated, but still not satisfied that I had taken enough pills to have a real good time.  So I took four more.  Not long after, three more.  Within fifteen minutes of taking that fourteenth pill, I really started to feel sick.  I lay down on the couch, hoping to start feeling better.  But it only got worse.  The weird smell from before was stronger than ever, and I was constantly smelling it.  It was so weird; just that smell pretty much gave me a bad headache.  I soon had to go into the bathroom and puke up some bright-yellow crap.  Felt a little better.  I lay back down on the couch.  But then I felt really bad again.  Puked up more yellow stuff.  Back to the couch.  Back to the toilet to puke.  I think I had to puke violently five or six times before I felt well enough to fall asleep.



The next morning, I go to school feeling terrible.  It helped a lot to put my head down, so every chance I had, I just kept my head down on my desk.  That day was some achievement testing thing so I had to stay to do that.  Taking that was no fun at all.  But as soon as it was done, I called my mom, and had her pick me up and take me home.  When I got home, I puked a bunch of yellow stuff one more time.  I lay on the couch and went to sleep.  For some reason, I don't recall whether I woke up later that day, or whether I slept till school the next day; but all I remember is that the next day I pretty much felt better.



I continue to take caffeine pills, but I don't plan on ever taking more than four in a day again.
