At one point I was working in a particularly stressful job and was developing some unhealthy habits in terms of alcohol consumption.  In order to better manage the stress and resulting anxiety (to which I am prone) I purchased a bottle of 150 mg valarian capsules.  Also having an experimentative mind, I wanted to see what recreational potential it had.



For the first week, I took the recommended 2 capsules.  The first few days I would wake up *extremely* groggy and disassociated, but the substance itself produced no noticable effects, recreational nor theraputic.  By the end of the week I was feeling fine (except for the anxious and stressed-out part).



The next week, I upped the dosage to 4 capsules, which seemed to have a mild effect of the anxiety/stress (I wasn't that way all the time\ldots   Only when in directly stressful situations.) but still no recreational advantages.



By the end of the fourth week, I was taking 14 tablets at one go.  I was still stressed only when provoked and sleeping better, but never noticed any feelings other than very mild elation at best.



As a recreational drug, I found it worthless.  As a theraputic drug, it works as long as you're not commonly thrust into stressful situations.
