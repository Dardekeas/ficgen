I learned about Kava.. from.. my mother.  I dont think she intended for me to use my information on healing herbs in an attempt for englightenment, or to get high.  However, I am of a diffrent mind.  After learning about it, I started searching.  I had a pound, which I ordered from the herbal store.  Finely powdered, it cost me 30 dollars.  I took a 44 ounce thirstbuster cup, filled it partway with water, and then stirred in Kava till it was like mud.. now.. this isnt for everyone.  I have to say it was about an ounce.  I did this several times, and it made me so I couldnt even lift my hand, it was like eating pain pills, I was layed out on my couch, smiling, I could hardly move my hands.  Very happy and relaxed, no stomach problems, and I actually enjoyed the earthy taste of it.    When I got to the end of the bag, about 2 ounces left, I put 3 bottles of rubbing alcohol in a pot, lit it up, dumped the kava into it and let it cook for a while.  I know it doesnt sound safe, but as long as it doesnt slop over (put it in a big pot).  I then strained it repeatedly, and then through a nylon, then I poured the extra liquid out on plates and let it dry.  It took a day or so, then I had this greenish brown sticky resin looking stuff.  Not much, a couple grams at most. 



I got a little bit on the end of a large safety pin, and lit it and inhaled the fumes.  It had a burnt brownie taste (Ive been told by people it tastes exactly like cocaine-rock being smoked) It was a nice taste mostly, and then immediately my head started spinning and I had to sit down while my body rushed, in this form, it definately did not act as a relaxant, my stomach clenched up and everything shimmered, it was great, it lasts for about 15-30 minutes.  The thing to remember with Kava is that every pound I buy is going to be different potency, and I have to say, the more I pay, the better it probally will be.  Ive only bought it 3 times, pounds at a time, but the first was the best, the second was mild, this last one is alright.
