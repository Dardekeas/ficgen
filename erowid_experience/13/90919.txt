To start, I would consider myself an experienced k user, and it is by far my favourite drug, although I do like shrooms and pills.



I have been using k fairly regularly for a few years now but I've tried to cut down as my tolerance has gotten to a point where I can comfortably do 500mg lines and go out and function within reasonable capacity. (everyones idea of reasonable capacity will be different, but I mean I can talk, walk in straight lines etc etc.)



I was really excited about trying Methoxetamine as I'd read other reports from k users saying it's got a hint of the k aspect to it but it is in itself a very unique drug.



Time 3:00am

I'd just gotten back from a gig in and a few people were in our flat having come home from their own nights out, I had drunk a bit throughout the night but wouldn't consider myself in any way intoxicated.



Time 3:30am 

Dose: roughly 50mg insufflated  

Decided with a less experienced drug user, female. 

Nothing much happened for a long time maybe 30 minutes?



Time 4:00am

Dose 50mg

Decided to redose as it didnt appear to be doing anything, maybe slight slurred speech and noticeably slower responses to questions but that was about it.



At this point, time got dilated past a point I can be accurate. I know I redosed several more times because, tbh, I'm an idiot and I like to experiment to see how far I can push a substance. I pushed it WAY too far. I can't be sure how much I dosed at this point because I spilled alot of it onto my bed. Smooth move.



Maybe 7:00am

The effects are similar to ketamine in the sense that I have virtually no control over the communication between my mouth and my brain. I knew what was going on around me, but had no way at all of conveying what I wanted to say to anybody despite knowing EXACTLY the words I wanted to say, I was unable to say them. I'd say it was similar to having about a 3second memory. You knew what you wanted to do, then you forgot it instantly. Got confused and tried to work out why you were confused. Which made you more confused. Not a fun experience.



I had expected the larger doses I knew I had done after the initial `fuzz' to put me into a hole, much like with ketamine, but it didn't. It just made me more and more unable to cope with everyday tasks whilst simultaneously knowing exactly what I wanted to do. This is unlike k in the sense that it doesn't give me that space travel sinking into a warm bath of honey feeling that I so much love from ketamine.



From about? 9:00am till about 4:00pm

Very difficult to talk, increased heartbeat, noticeable shaking in the hands and feet. Felt almost as if I was skipping frames in my head as for every step I took it felt like I'd missed one. Still difficult to walk.



Now for the scary part:

This stuff isn't like ketamine in the sense that, with ketamine, I can return to near normality within half hour to an hour. I was ruined for about 24 hours. I had extremely intense closed eye visuals for the whole time, was unable to sleep for the best part of 2 days. Walking was possible but after lying down for a while my balance was destroyed. Speech still slurred. A complete lack of understand of words/numbers/equations etc. anything that was remotely lingual was virtually impossibly to comprehend.



Now I'd say this is probably because I did way too large a dose, I'm not proud of it and I definitely don't think it was a good idea. I found the experience genuinely frighting and was EXTREMELY depressed and confused in the later part of the evening, 8p-11pm.



I had a very heartfelt chat with my girlfriend on the phone and tried to get to sleep, which I found virtually impossible due to the onslaught of CEV's.



CONCLUSION

I would strongly advise that anyone experimenting this due to its relationship with ketamine be VERY careful. I'm sure under the right circumstance it could be an ALRIGHT experience, but in my view ketamine is a much more friendly (for myself) drug.  And I will most certainly NOT be trying Methoxetamine again, and will steer well clear of any more research chems.
