I guess i have a sort of `correction' for the great article that mr. william e. white wrote entitled `this is your brain on dissociatives.' 



When explaining Ketamine, mr. White states that it is used on children as an anaesthetic because they `don't get the psychedelic effects of dissociatives.'  This is not true, or at least, not always true.  



When i was 7 years old (1986)i had to undergo a muscle biopsy and was given K to knock me out.  The problem was that they didn't give me enough K to render me completely unconscious; i was floating over the operating table, looking down on myself and the doctors, seeing the incision, the blood leaking out, and hearing them chatter away.  I then went to the next level- full astral projection.  At one point i opened my physical eyes and started looking around (remember, i was 7 and confused).  



I remember clearly the doctors noticing i was awake and saying `holy shit, this kids awake!!! get more, NOW!' and within moments i was given several more injections of *something* and was out cold until i woke up in the recovery room, still feeling the nasty k hangover.  Ever since that experience i've been a very different person in relation to my peers and others around me.  i took something back with me; some of it good, but definately some of it very EVIL as i have been plagued by vivid nightmares, daymares and perceptions of and attractions to darkness on levels that most people don't even imagine exist.  



I also acquired a `sense' for things, its like i can see things for what they really are, breaking through situations and circumstances and seeing the spiritual roots behind them.  i am a christian, though i have since that operation had tremendous difficulties with demonic oppression which can sometimes `slide' into a type of possession.  shit, if you think giving a hit of ACID to a 7 year old is a bad idea\ldots . ketamine is so much more (but you know that).



Two years ago i ran into some K and bought it, not knowing anything about it.  I started with little bumps to catch a buzz, then one night took more than I thought I did and seperated from my body again and had a full blown OBE/NDE, melted into the universal collective light energy and was graced by the presence of God himself (itself).



As soon as the sensation of the dose hit me i KNEW beyond a shadow of a doubt that this same ketamine was what they gave me when i was a little kid, as that experience was immediately brought back to my mind in vivid detail and feeling, as if i was living it all over again.  I did my homework, learned more about k (thanks, erowid!!!) and discovered that in 1986 they did in fact give me K.  my whole life made so much more sense to me\ldots  I finally had an explaination as to why i was so incredibly different from the others (as a little kid I didn't consciously realize the connection between my mind/soul and my surgery).  



So, basically I'm saying that K does work on kids (at least me).
