Reported Dose: 8 Mixed drinks, 2g cannibis



It was my 22nd birthday party, and I had been drinking throughout the night. At around 11:30pm someone had asked me for a ride home. I obliged, knowing that I was sober enough to drive. At the time, I suspect I was near the legal limit when I got behind the wheel. And then I made two of the worst mistakes of my life. By the time I arrive at my friends house, he decides that he doesn't want to go home yet, and suggests that we have another drink. `C'mon man, its your birthday!' He says, and I obliged. One drink turns into six, and by last call I was completely intoxicated. At this point my friend wants to come stay at my house, so we start heading back, knowing that the whole trip was pointless to begin with. 



At this point I made the second mistake that ended in my downfall. I began to feel invincible. I decided in my delusional state to run every red light from downtown to my house. My luck ran out when I blazed through a red light at well over 60 miles an hour, coming within feet of striking a squad car. I was immediately pulled over, road tested and arrested. 



By the time I was detained and processed, I had a blood alcohol level of .167, double the legal limit for a DWAI, and .067 over the DUI limit. At this point I was hauled off to detox, where I was held against my will until 11:30AM the following morning. After my arraignment, plea bargain and sentencing, I lost my license for three months, was forced into alcohol therapy sessions for six months, and ended up paying well over \$2000 in fines, fees, and inflated insurance costs. 



Ultimately, I consider myself fortunate. If I had ran that light 3 seconds later than I did, I would have been prosecuted for vehicular homicide of a police officer. The cop I nearly hit may have very well saved my life. 



Please, don't drink and drive. I thought I could handle my liquor, until I lost all sense of rational behavior. As the old clich√© says: `The life you save may be your own.'
