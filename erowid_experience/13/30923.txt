I have had a few experience with chronic before but now I wanted to try blowing yayo.  Tonight was the second time I have blown yayo.  The first time I blew lines was last weekend and it didn't do much to me, same effects as the ones I had tonight which I will list. Both times I did a brush then blew the lines then lick the empty sac and desk clean (1g each time).  



The effects that I felt were good for the brush/licking the coke.  It made my mouth and tongue feel warm, soft and kinda tingly, this hit me within 1 min of licking it and didn't last more then 3 or 4 min.  This was very good, coke brushes are very fun.



Then I blew the lines and my effects were increased heart rate, kinda shaky or jittery (I keep bouncing my leg up and down, I couldn't stop moving if I tried), then a little bit later my jaw adjusted to kinda hurt, I was just moving it around a lot and I guess it got pretty sore, even now I cant stop my legs from shaking or my jaw from moving around.  I was a little more focused and concentrated but for how much coke it those effects aren't what I wanted.  



I felt no signs of euphoria either time.  I didn't get depressed, I just like was neutral\ldots  nothing mentally was really different\ldots  but I am pretty sure I felt all the physical effects.  I hadn't finished my gram quite yet so I decided to snort it double time to see if I was taking it to slow, now I got a new effect, I was slightly numb and warm all over, my spine kinda feels stiff too.  One effect that I haven't seen any mention is that I can't take deep breaths, I figure this is because of my high heart rate.  



Quick summary:



Too expensive for the lack of good effects



I can get the same effects I experienced by snorting some Adderall or Ritalin and vicodin and oxycodone for about 1/10 the price cost of the yayo.
