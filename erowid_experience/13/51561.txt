I go to a military academy and we are drug tested pretty often so we can't use Marijuana or any other commonly used drug. I was curious to see what other substances I could take that would get me high so I did some research and found out that nutmeg can do the job. Last weekend I had nothing to do so I planned on taking the nutmeg then.



I took the nutmeg at noon on Friday. I mixed 4 1/2 table spoons with water and honey. It tastes pretty disgusting. I felt pretty sick for the next 30 min. but after I had lunch I was fine. At 3:45 I had baseball practice so I walked to the field about 15 min early with my friend. I felt fine and normal up until I lay down in the grass and looked up at the clouds. I remember the clouds looking really cool and right there I went into a trip which lasted about 5 minutes in which according to my friend I went on and on talking about how pretty the sky was and giggling and laughing at the same time. When I sat back up I returned to my normal state but had no memory of what just happened. I was very surprised and knew that this was the beginning of my nutmeg experience.



After my first trip I was feeling normal at first but then gradually became disoriented and had a mild sense of euphoria. When I say disoriented I mean I was totally out of whack. I had no sense of time, didn't know where I was, couldn't recognize people, and found it very hard to think. Externally I was acting pretty much normal but in my mind I would do things before I would think about doing them, and then have a vague memory of it after I did it. It was very weird and to be honest it was a bit scary. All this was going on during baseball practice which although it lasted 2 hours it felt to me like 10 or 15 minutes. The walk back from baseball practice was insane. My feelings described above were getting extreme and I was getting pretty scared because I didn't know what was going on and I didn't know where I was. When I got to my room I just collapsed onto my bed with all my muddy clothes on and went to sleep.



I woke up at about 8:00 by my friend knocking on my door. Although I still felt under the influence and had a case of cottonmouth, I felt much better and more relaxed. I decided to go to a dance with my friend but before we left he wanted to take the nutmeg and I suggested he didn't but he ate 5 tbs. (he weighs about 180 pounds). We got to the dance and I began to feel how I was feeling before and was getting pretty hot and my heart rate increased a little. From then on I don't remember much because the feelings were getting very extreme. I remember being at chili's with some friends but don't remember how I got there. I remember looking around the table and seeing my friends looking at me with concerned faces. I was feeling pretty terrible and had no idea what was going on or where I was. I really needed to go back and get some sleep so a friend took me back to my room. We were out 2 hours late so we had to sneak in. We were spotted by some campus personnel so we just ran the whole way back and while running I had a really bad case of cottonmouth and had a hard time breathing. Somehow we got back to my room without getting caught.



As soon as I got in I crashed on my bed and slept until 8:00 the following day. I woke up still feeling mildly under the influence and got something to eat then went back to sleep and woke up Sunday morning. Basically the nutmeg put me to sleep for about 30 hours. I felt like shit for about 72 hours after I took the nutmeg. All day Sunday I felt somewhat confused and found it hard to think straight. It wasn't until Sunday night that I was feeling normal again. This was basically a waste of a weekend.



My conclusion on nutmeg is that it was a mistake to try it. Or at least a mistake to take so much. The amount I took was way too much. At first it felt pretty good almost like marijuana but afterwards it was rather scary. I wouldn't take it again. By the way my friend who took 5 tbs. was taking a leak and passed out and hit his head on the bathroom floor.
