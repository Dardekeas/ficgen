My use of nutmeg has been extensive over the last twelve years.  I find it a pleasant escape into something of a waking dream state when planned.  Set and setting are most important since precise preparation is a must. Only proper dosage under the right conditions will produce a long, pleasurable experience. I have mixed many variations of different substances with the nut and have experienced a wide range of results. Some are more difficult to remember than others due to heavy partying. I will only reveal to you the most vivid memory.



Christmas Day of `99 my wife and I ate one medium sized nut each with eggnog at about 9am. We were in good humor prior to the ingestion, and in fair to good physical condition. We also ingested several grams of ginger (pill form) to prevent nausea. After an hour we felt stoned and decided to get on with the day of happiness and love. As the long ride to mom's sunk into my head, snow started to fall. This triggered visuals of tiny dancing fairies. These were not real pronounced, although a larger dose would have had a deeper effect. The visuals increased to objects appearing and then vanishing throughout the remainder of the day and night. 



We made sure we drank lots of water whenever we could, to prevent dehydration. Nutmeg has a way of drying you out and can really fuck up an entire week if you're not careful.



The nutmeg seemed to clarify all positive feelings and enhanced the initial orgasm of giving and receiving. My irritation level and stress were at an all time low as I gracefully ate the wonderful colorful Christmas dinner. My whole body felt warm despite the bitter cold that was lurking around. I felt like I had a cross between a good weed buzz and demerol with a little more control. I can not link the visuals to any other drug. The hallucinations seem to be more real, but less intrusive than LSD or mushrooms.



Not once that I know of did any family members suspect us of doing any more than a little wine, although our eyes were red as all hell. I will continue to use this spice for fun and hope the best experiences to anyone else who wants to use this responsibly. Oh yeah I almost forgot, if either of us would have chosen to drive that day, we would have been fucked!
