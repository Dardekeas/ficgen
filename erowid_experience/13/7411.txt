Last night in desparation for pot (and a lack thereof) I decided that I would try to smoke some Kava Kava.



I took a capsule of pure kava kava that I bought a a local health store, broke it open, and poured it into a normal tobacco pipe that I fitted with a screen.



I took two hits and was unable to finish the rest.  The effects were like being stoned, only with much more awareness and a sort of inner peace.  I also experienced mild hallucinations where the folds of my blanket kept turning into small furry animals.  The most amazing part was the complete lack of paranoia.  I felt like everything was at peace and that life was, for some reason, making sense.  



After enjoying the mild trip for a little while, I began to meditate.  I found this hard to do because everything I looked at was so interesting and vivid.  After about 15 minutes of hard focusing, I went into a sort of trance where I pictured myself floating up above myself.  The imagination was greatly enhanced.  Then about and hour later I returned out of meditation and fell immediately asleep.  For a person who suffers insomnia, this is just short of incredible.  Not even pot would put me to sleep.



In short, smoking kava kava has made for the most relaxed that I've ever been in my life.  The drug doesn't by any means make me feel happy.  But I found that I was able to focus and feel at peace.  The best part is, for a broke college student, that it's way sheaper then most anything and readily available at the grocery store.  Also, the `high' lasted a lot longer, granted the euphoria did not.  I woke up this morning feeling completely relaxed and now, almost 10 hours later, I still feel focused and relaxed.
