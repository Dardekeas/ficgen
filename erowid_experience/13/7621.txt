Recently, I have been interested in finding legal highs.  I found quite a bit of information off the internet, including this site.  As I looked at the list, nutmeg struck my fancy.  I thought, `I can get high on NUTMEG??'  I have tried it a few times, and they all had their ups and downs.  I thought I'd share my most recent experience.



I went down to the grocery store and bought an ounce of ground nutmeg (expensive stuff!  not exactly something I'd buy very often).  Since I know how crappy this stuff tastes, I took the liberty of putting the nutmeg powder into gelcaps.  The gelcaps were not empty, so I emptied out the stuff that was in it, and packed the nutmeg in there real tight.  It equaled out to about 22 capsules or so.  I promptly swallowed them all accompanied by a big glass of water.  Cool!  Now all I had to do was wait.  About an hour later I ate dinner.  Just as I finished, the effects came on quickly.  It was uncomfortable\ldots  pretty shitty feeling.  It felt as if little bugs were crawling under my skin.  No matter what I did, I could not get comfortable.  I was irritible and just decided to lay down for a while.  I did feel slight nausea, as if my body was telling me it does not approve of this crap I took.



This uncomfortable and irritating feeling lasted for about 2 hours, and I wish it would just end!  I had called a friend over and was seriously thinking of calling the night off and telling him to go home.  But the tension slowly passed, and it felt as if I was not high any more.  But one thing, I had the taste of nutmeg in my mouth!  I don't know how this is possible, but everything I ate tasted like nutmeg.  I ate some cookies, and the taste was STILL there.  Finally, after having some ice cream, the taste went away.  My friend and I watched and episode of SNL later that night (about 2 hours later).  I was laughing my head off like never before!  I know SNL is funny, but damn, I couldn't stop laughing!  This was the feeling I was looking for.  It wasn't so much of a `high' feeling, but I felt mellow and had a case of the chuckles.  The only uncomfortable part was the dry mouth, which lasted long into the next morning.



The next morning was fun also\ldots  but in a different way.  I was SOOO hungry and thirsty.  Eating never felt so good in my entire life!  Every gulp of my turkey sandwich and soda was pure ecstacy!  I ate a lot that day, and never seemed to be full.  This hungry/thirsty feeling lasted until the late evening and went away.



Overall, it was not even close to a hallucinogenic experience, but it was very amusing.  I think if you have the time, try nutmeg.  But be careful on your dosage, don't overdue it.



Peace!
