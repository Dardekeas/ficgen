I have taken Diphenhydramine before and somewhat enjoyed the effects. I also like using it after a bit of a binge as I find it removes any desire to keep using a substance. However I have built up a bit of tolerance and mostly just get a body load. I decided to try Meclizine to see if I could get the same deleriant effect with less body load and tolerance.



I took 15 25mg Bonamine chewable tabs. Quite disgusting. Don't chew them all at once, the chalky flavour builds up. Taken at about 10pm stayed up till around 12 waiting for effects. No body load, just a tiny perception that something was different, could have been the roiling in my guts. After reading for most of that time I give up the night as lost as any hallucinations would have shown up by now or at least given me a body load as indication. Lay my head down and fall asleep by accident while still reading. Wake up at 4am fairly alert and feeling fine. I blow out my candle and get the blankets and go back to sleep. Wake up 9-10am and still alright. Only verifiable effect is a slight body shock (the tingling on my skin when I am surprised) if I am sufficiently surprised the following day. With Diph I would be sluggish and have strong body shocks but not so now.
