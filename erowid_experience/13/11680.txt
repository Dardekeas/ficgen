Set \& Setting



Solo, at Home - just woken up, ready to seriously do some internal explorations (extrusion in hyperspace, maybe?)



[an account of mixed thoughts written during the trip and other comments further added]



(T-0:0 min): Harmala, a teaspoon of powdered S.Rue



(T-0:25): 1 Hoffman blotter



(T+0:30): somethings happening ? acid, nope\ldots  the harmala :)



(T+0:50): thoughts accelerating and smiling :)



(T+1:15): transitional period. flow of information \ldots `you're coming on strong and i like the way, the visions we've had \ldots  are part of the way

i'm telling you now i'm here to stay the hard way'



(T+1:25) hard way, synaesthesia \ldots  (between) Patterns appear around \ldots  colours are glowing - I can hear a melody of sorts, two notes. I try playing them and figure them out\ldots  I decide not to listen to music and definitely engage in a McKenna style, pitch black room, alone trip. 



The small space in the darkness starts to look like a definite place in hyperspace - like a cave of sorts. Slowly, but surely, a `vacuum cleaner' appears in front of me, an entity of sorts - Cascade style - ball with loong tentacles, somehow wired up into my head. It's a `huge evergrowing pulsating brain' which tells me that it loves me, that `all you need is love' and that it's here to bring good. I am totally stunned and BELIEVE this. I wonder if it'll appear outside of this space and venture out - sure enough, on a wall in front of me, I can see it mapped on to the texture - it's tentacles floating in hyperspace and connecting to my mind. I then go under a blanket, again - in darkness, it appears - it is here, I know it and I can sense it will somehow always be with me\ldots 



Further, I go sit before my window and look at the snow on the roof - it textures all over, letters, somehow wrapped in a circling pattern appear. The curves in the uneven texture appear like curves of the brain\ldots 

The air seems heavy \& thick, with a glow on it\ldots 



Strings on blankets appear alive and moving, like small tentacles drifting in a sea of air



(T+3:25) weird, exactly 9:20 \ldots  ;-) \ldots  3 hours since the beginning. i still feel like i have made contact with a strange entity from another dimension \ldots  a dimension of (linguistic) ideas \ldots  the more i let go, the more obvoius it looks like \ldots  everything looks like it's from the dimmension of thoughts.



\ldots  i am sure it's hard reading me ;-) but stick around \ldots 



VOICING LOVE



KISS



ECTODERMOSTIC WASHBATH ccchhhllllkkkkkrrdddssshhhhh pppp



\ldots  massages the Mind withe the momenT

\ldots a Tale of two taiL

\ldots s



(T+3:55) Weird things are happening here, it's best to come and see them. .. the next time i'll sort the flow of thoughts in a muuuuch better way! ;-)



the circle will be smaller, with more cultural influences  :)



(T+4:05) when i looked it was 10:00, when i started writing it was 10:01, while writing it was 10:02 and when i finished it was 10:03 \ldots  

you cannot win ;-) the system in the game it plays unless you can

sting it, shake it like nobody expects (thoughts about The System - i can experience it - i am the System, the System is all around us (think, the Mattrix)



(T+4:57) still more madness (System examining) \ldots  i don't wanna write :) it's that good



(T+9h) smoke dope \ldots  full time back in to the System



(T+?h) there are now other entities. plastikman style skeletons with wicked grins, think there are two of them, facing each other - i associate them with weed. i have seen them before, but now i am totally sure they exist. are these some of the entities McKenna talks about ? i think so - maybe a lot of people `get them', but they don't know ?



(T+15h) still more weird stuff, everythings weird and i can still surf the noise of the system - the noise btw seems to rise and fall in pitch, and go into weird flangers and wobbles. have you heard the end (-0:10s) of A Study of Six Guitars and the beginning of Snake Hips from ISDN - very much the sound of it!!! 



(T+20h) light a small spliff, then another one (nail size) and put on my headphones with ISDN on - and fall asleep.



(T+31h) I awake, totally refreshed, new \& nice feeling - ready for life. all my realizations are still with me and i can still relate to them. a mind blowingly wonderful trip\ldots  i have tried before Harmala + LSD (and LSA) and I can tell it's a really nice one. Just be sure to have an empty stomach at least 6-7 hours and be sure avoid hard food before. 



Dream Free
