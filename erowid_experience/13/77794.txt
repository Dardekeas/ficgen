Having recently been informed of a new chemical known as JWH-018, I unfaltering searched and found a small quantity. Intrigued by its effects and similarity to cannabis, I decided to give it a try. Before hitting the chemical through a water pipe, my dealer told me to make sure I had a driver. That being said, my accompanist for the evening and I flipped a coin to see who would hit and who would drive. I won the hit!



I inhaled the entire hit, holding my breath and clearing it. It tastes very similar to plastic and somewhat unpleasant. I waited about 2 minutes and found that the chemical was much more potent than I had originally expected. My accompanist and I quickly left to the vehicle. Walking was difficult and paranoia was highly in effect.



Before the door was even shut I had completely lost contact with reality. Everything was bright and vibrant, moving in waves much similar to LSD or DMT. A euphoric confusion overcame me and I only had enough focus to tell my driver that I was tripping and not to worry. This ride became one of the most intense psychological trips I had ever taken. I couldn't even talk. I didn't know who I was or where I was.  I could only sit there in my seat, tripping out while my driver freaked that I was overdosing. I kept gagging and I didn't know why. I felt that I was panicking so I became determined to just go with this unexpected trip. Nothing is worse that tripping out when you least expect it. After deciding that going home wasn't an option, we drove to the park. 



Here, is where my trip really turned around and became somewhat fun. I felt a colossal connection with the trees and one with the earth. Everything was meaningful! However, I kept going through bipolar phases where I would be having fun and smiling, but then quickly transition into depressed sadness and then back. This was very odd and different from previous salvia, LSD, DMT, and mushroom trips. I sat here in my seat for about 20 minutes, gazing at the beautiful creation of nature and the harmony between us. My driver still freaked, but by this time I had informed her that I coming down. 



After coming down a little, we decided to go home. I went inside and listened to music for about an hour while extreme thoughts of life and nature raced through my mind. I learned about my true self and power of the human mind! I view this experience as a gift that should not be taken lightly. I then fell asleep and slept for an abnormally prolonged period of time. The next morning I awoke with no hangover of any sort, however, an odd pain in my lower back. Mentally, I was secure and ready for a new day of enjoyment and deep thinking.



It can be said that anyone wanting to experiment with JWH-018 should use extreme caution with the dose. DO NOT DRIVE while under this influence!! I think that .5 to 1mg. will ensure a similar effect to cannabis, only more intense. 



2mg. threw me into euphoric trip like never before!
