This happened when I was 22 years old. Id say that it was the most intense mind expanding experience of my life. 



            My buddies and I lived together in a house and every weekend we d have big parties. I had read and been deeply influenced by the shamanistic description of the world described by Carlos Casteneda. I was experienced with mushrooms, acid, weed and drunkeness and was eager to try more. One day one of my buddies told me that some young drug dealer he knew had peyote buttons for sale so we bought three.



         I didnt find out until recently that what we took was not peyote but actually Datura. 



       The party had started and I was relatively drunk. My buddy showed up with these three little green vegetable things. Definately the large buds of flowers with little bumps on them that used to be spines. Three of us pop them into our mouths and they taste really bitter but juicy like a rotten green pepper or something.



        Very quickly like 45 minutes later or so I was expereincing strong visual distortions that were similar to mushrooms or acid. Melting walls, intense colors, patterns. And I though wow this is going to be cool!



         But then I was downstairs and there were bottles all around and everyone was gone. I asked my buddy where is everyone.  And then he told me that the party was over and it was the next day. My memory was extremely messed up. Over the next little while I peiced together what had happened from my own mind and the veiwpoint of witnesses. 



Here goes:

       After everything starting melting like a strong acid trip me and my two freinds passed out for about half an hour. When we woke up we were sleep walking. Half in the reality of the party, half in an illusionary reality. It was impossible to differentiate between the two.  When we spoke it would come out as complete gibberish. But to us we were speaking very clearly. We were all very happy throughout the whole trip. 



      At one point I was talking gibberish to some people at the top of a staircase when I decided to just fall over. Witnesses said it seemed like I did it purposefully. I just leaned over and fell all the way down to the bottom of the staricase and got up without injury, and just continued wandering around.



          It really seemed to witnesses as if we were retarded. Speaking and looking just like mentally handicapped people do. We really were in a dream.



          I kept telling everyone about this huge tower that was 1000 feet high and 1000 years old and I was pointing to it. Also I talked about a tropical beach and a harbour. At one point I had a long discussion with a girl about special ways to hold your hands to prevent yourself from being harmed from psychic attacks. These details I gathered from witnesses.



          The interesting thing about our hallucinations is that sometimes it seems like the three of us could hallucinate about the same thing. One time I had this sort of puking fit and couphed and couphed and then puked all over the floor. My tripping buddies came over and we looked at the puke. But I actually didnt puke. We were hallucinating it together.



         For a period my buddies thought they were at work and were working together in the kitchen thinking it was the kitchen of their actual job. They seemed to have a great time as they cooked up invisible meals and washed invisible dishes. 



          All of us really wanted to climb and we were climbing the staircase and bookshelves etc. All of this I have no memory of.



         My memory comes back towards the end of the trip. At this point I would be partly dreaming and then be shifting between the two realities. So Id be talking to a person, and then Id go to light my cigarette. And Id be smoking really enjoying watching the smoke and talking. And then Bang! Id suddenly realize that I was talking to the wall and I was just waving my fingers around thinking I was smoking.  This weird effect lasted for a long time but I was entertained by it rather than frightened. Id think someone was there and start talking to them and then they d just disapear. The crazy thing is that at this point I got in my car and drove to another house and was alone there talking to invisible people for some time before returning to the party. (or was that a total hallucination) \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



          Although it seems like it would be disturbing, for some reason I was always happy and it seemed like I was in control. I really cant emphasize more that it was a dreaming expereince. I had a good time because I had good dreams. I reckon  that If I was stressed and had nightmares, it could have been disasterous. My confidence might have been a result of the achohol, so might have been the forgetfullness.



             Our pupils stay dilated for a few days afterwards and my vision was distorted. Also severe cottonmouth throughout. We kept drinking cup after cup of water but our thirst could not be satisfied



             This event was a turning point in my life. I had been shown how reality is all relative. Everybodys mind can generate reailties that are perfectly real. So you realize that nothing is truly real. Everything is relative. The bhudist concept of Maya is illustrated. Its not just a metaphor any more. The occult implications of this are profound. 



        There s no way of knowing whether the entities  and realities I experienced were actual living things and places or simply figments of my imagination. But it made me question the reality of everything around me.

       

          I would definately experience with Datura again if I could find it. Especially exciting was the fact that many of us could expereince the same dream together.  With practice I feel this plant could really teach you a lot! But its hardcore. Definately not for those prone to bad trips. Extensive experience with other hallucanegens like acid or mushrooms are reccomended. Also the party scene was not really the best I feel. This plant needs to be respected.
