I had a big assignment due the next day, do i decided that instead of drinking a million cups of coffee like I had the last time I pulled an all nighter (and got very sick), I thought caffiene pills would keep me awake but not make me nauseas. I started at about 7 pm, with one pill, then another after about an hour. 



I became very alert but after a while, I stopped being able to focus and while on the phone with a friend for a short while he commented on how little sense I was making. I continued to take the pills when I felt I was `coming down' until about 3 am. At about 4 am, I became so physically sick I had to stop doing my assignment. I decided to go lie down and try to sleep. Unable to sleep, I had a sort of panic attack and sat upright in my bed, rocking back and forth. I was convinced that if I fell asleep right then I would die, and that if I lied down I would fall asleep. I thought at that time that I had the ability to end my life at any moment simply by lying back down. After some amount of time (I have no idea how long this continued for), I went to sleep. I was sick the next morning and had a `caffeine hangover' for three days.
