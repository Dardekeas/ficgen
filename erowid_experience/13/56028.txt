\textbf{Pethidine} is also known as \textbf{meperidine} a.k.a \textbf{Demerol}, an opiate agonist used for moderate to severe pain, with an equivalency of 7.5 mg of pethidine to 1 mg of morphine in parenteral administration. Pethidine/meperidine has a duration of 2 hours so it's a pretty short acting opioid. I was out doctor shopping the whole of last night and didn't get a hit out of the five medical establishments I went to. I guess six is my lucky number coz I managed to get a pethidine IM injection from it. =D

This is \textbf{Injection Pethidine Hydrochloride 50 mg/ml} made by \textbf{DuoPharma} (Malaysia). I have never tried pethidine IM injection so imagine my glee as I made this happen. ,)



\textbf{Doctor: }You were here for DF-118 last time right? The medical record says you have a bad back.

\textbf{Me: }I actually had a slipped disc (actually, I don't ,)) and it slipped again for the second time.

(makes `ouch face', grimaces and made as if my spinal cord was killing me)

\textbf{Doctor: }Do we have DF-118 here? (talking to nurse)

\textbf{Nurse: }(after rummaging through the restricted access medication cabinet, they don't have it, I know that coz I've been here before) No we don't, but we have Voltaren.

\textbf{Doctor: }Do you want something else? I can give you another pain-killer.

\textbf{Me: }(Hell no! It's opiates or nothing) Doctor, I hope you can help coz I'm in a lot of pain right now. Can you write a script or something?

\textbf{Doctor: }Okay, do you have a medical history of your slipped disc?

\textbf{Me: }Yeah, I had an MRI and X-Ray done in KL, where it happened (which didn't happen, of course ,)) and the prognosis was a slipped disc, which I slipped again just now (*grimace of pain*)

\textbf{Doctor: }Do you have it with you?

\textbf{Me: }No, I'm sorry doctor, I left the medical documents in KL\ldots 

\textbf{Doctor: }Okay, well since you have a prior here, I'll script you. Is there anything else?

\textbf{Me: }(pushing my luck, deciding to go for gold) Hey, I know this is a strange question, but I'm in a lot of pain right now, do you have anything to help me get through tonight? Can you give me a morphine shot? (Prays to God he doesn't go amok)

\textbf{Doctor: }Morphine\ldots hmm\ldots well, we do have morphine but we don't give it to outpatients. I think we have pethidine though, do you want that?

\textbf{Me: }Is pethidine an opiate? (Knowing full well it is, but no harm in playing the dumb patient)

\textbf{Doctor: }Yes it is.

(Writes \textbf{Pethidine 50 mg IM stat} on my medical record)

\textbf{Me: }(looks) (tries not to grin) (tries not to grin again, perhaps somewhat unsuccessfully) Thank you very much doctor.

\textbf{Doctor: }Alright, just lie there and I'll prep the shot.

\textbf{Me: }(puts on a show of painful lying down and bolts straight up, apparently with a good back again) Hey, I'm sorry doctor, another unusual request, can I take a photo of the pethidine vial?

\textbf{Doctor: }Why?

\textbf{Me: }It's just an interest of mine. (starts photoshoot of the IM pethidine 50 mg snap off ampoule) Thanks doctor.

\textbf{Doctor: }Okay, I'm going to inject you now. Turn over.

\textbf{Me: }Er\ldots can I take the IM injection in my arm? (I don't want the doctor to see my thigh, which is the best place to bang shit if you're holding down a professional job - full of scar marks and bruises from injections - he would have known for sure I'm an IDU - Injecting Drug User).

\textbf{Doctor: }(Grips my arm) Seems to be okay here.

\textbf{Me: }(starts filming the procedure)

\textbf{Script from pethidine injection video:}

\textbf{Me: }Is it in? Pethidine 50 mg?

\textbf{Doctor: }Mmm\ldots 

\textbf{Me: }Okay, IM, sixthseal.com (Jesus Christ, I should not have said that in the video but it just slipped out).

(sounds of pethidine injection process)

\textbf{Me: }Yeah, that's the place.

\textbf{Doctor: }Hmm\ldots why do you have some bruises here?

(OMG those are my IM injection spots when I was injecting ketamine)

\textbf{Me: }Er\ldots uh\ldots they're some just bruises, ya know. I probably hit something.

(Quickly changes subject)

\textbf{Me: }So, is that pethidine 50 mg?

\textbf{Doctor: }Yeah.

\textbf{Me: }Thanks.

[video no longer available]



\textbf{Doctor: }Are you driving?

\textbf{Me: }Er\ldots no. (actually I am)

\textbf{Doctor: }This will cause the usual opiate side effects, drowsiness etc. so be careful.

\textbf{Me: }I will, my friend is just outside (actually no one is outside, I don't take friends on doctor shopping expedition after a disastrous incident where I lost a good doctor coz me and my friend was stoned and high on meth and she had a laughing fit).

\textbf{Doctor: }Okay, here is your script. You're not a drug addict are you?

\textbf{Me: }(*coughs and nearly chokes*) Of course I'm not. I hate drugs. ,) (I didn't wink, I'm just winking on the blog)

\textbf{Doctor: }Good.

--$>$



\textbf{Price of 50 mg pethidine vial: }RM 10

\textbf{Price of surgical consumable items (that means the syringe and swabs): }RM 0.40

\textbf{Price of boosting a pethidine shot: }PRICELESS! =D

--$>$



\textbf{Pethidine Experience Report:}

(10 minutes after the shot)

\textbf{Me: }I'm not feeling it yet, doctor? How long does it take to kick in?

\textbf{Doctor: }It's not going to be so fast.

\textbf{Me: }So we can't IV pethidine huh?

\textbf{Doctor: }(gives me a strange look) No, it's for IM.

\textbf{Me: }Okay, thank you very, very much doctor.

(Shakes doctor's hand very vigorously, perhaps too enthusiastic to be unsuspicious)

T+ 0:30: A general feeling of elation and well being. Don't know if it's the pethidine or the euphoria of getting away with a shot of pethidine just like that.

T+ 0:45: Cigarettes smokes well, like on opiates but it's nowhere near as strong as dihydrocodeine. It does give a rather pleasant high though - kinda chill, but still motivated, I'm typing this as we speak, which I usually don't.

T+ 1:00: I think this is the peak - it's nothing special - I could compare it to a cross between tramadol and codeine if that makes sense. It feels like tramadol + codeine\ldots and er, it seems a wee bit hallucinatory, I don't know how to explain it, it's like the feeling when I get a hit of LSD and am about to come up and trip, but it never happens. I just mentioned it coz I saw the cigarette smoke drifting off. Perhaps a more apt description would be a very mild case of Ambien induced hallucinations.

T+ 1:30: Hey, I'm feeling a little of that opiate warmth now. It's nice but too mild for my tolerance.



50 mg of pethidine wasn't enough to get me off, but I did feel good - which part of it is the phethedine and which part is the elation of pulling this shit off is subjective. I'm full of glee though. :)

--$>$



\textbf{Pethidine} IM feels a lot like a combination of tramadol and codeine at doses of 100 mg and 300 mg respectively. There is a general feeling of well being and slight stimulation but with some of the jitteriness of tramadol (very mild). It's more like a cross between tramadol and codeine. The opiate warmth is present but mild. At my tolerance level, 50 mg of pethidine isn't much, but at least I can feel it\ldots and I'm STILL feeling st0ked about pulling this off! =D
