At the time I was 18 years old. I had just started experimenting with methadone (which I would later battle addiction with), and on this particular day I couldn't find any. My friend had been in an auto accident and was given a lot of sample packs of Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine). There were two 10mg pills that were orange and shaped like the home base in baseball in each pack. He gave me four packs and said that he gets `really sedated' on just two of them. Well our miscommunication played a good role in this as I was thinking of `sedated' as being an opiate high, and he thought of it as just being simply relaxing and tiring.



I ended up getting some methadone before I left work that day, and decided to mix the two when I got home. At about 11pm I took the two 10mg pills of methadone (not methadose, these were the 54/142 pills) and broke them into four pieces each, and washed them down with a shot of rum. I then took all eight of the flexeril with some water. I then smoked two bowls and sat in the floor to smoke and drink.



I would take a shot, then smoke a bowl. I did this eight times before the methadone and flexeril kicked in and so did the nausea. I quickly jumped into an indian-style sitting position on my bed and reached for my trash can which was not currently in my room so I reached for the next best thing: a 1/4 full bag of ranch doritos. I threw up enough to where the bag could sit open on my bed without me having to hold it there. I spent the next couple of hours throwing up then dry heaving trying to decide if I should wake my parents up to take me to the hospital. I finally lied down with my heart beating so fast I thought I would die of a heart attack. My head was throbbing, but my body felt good from the methadone.



I woke up the next morning without any adverse effects (surprisingly). I felt the methadone still (which I LOVE waking up to) which was nice, but other than that I had no form of hangover.



I'm glad I learned at an early age not to mix pills or pills with alcohol before I really got bad into pills (how I am now) or I might have made a very bad combination that would have killed me like an MAOI and practically anything else (even turkey!) or high doses of opiates (opioids) and benzodiazepines.
