Wine: 12 oz 

Beer: 16 oz

Clonazepam : .75 mg

Morning Glory (Heavenly Blue variety): 7.5 grams

Cannabis: .5 grams

Ibuprofen : 800mg



Sloppy Preparation Method:



Obtained 7.5 g of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds from local plant nursery Ferry-Moore organic brand with no additivies. Ground 7.5g, approx 300+ seeds??, in washed out coffee grinder. Seeds stuck to the sides and top of grinder so bitch to get out and into filters. Poured ground mixture into coffee filter and wrapped up in a tea-bag-like shape and staple shut. Place in bowl of cold water and let sit for about 30 minutes. Took out mixutre, squeezed `tea-bag', which burst a bit, and transferred to new coffee filter and repeated procedure. Set liquid in bowl aside and added shot of vinegar. Supposedly helps release the alkaloids.  Not sure if I want to drink the liquid but it is recommended.





2:30 pm



T:0:00



Ingested .05 mg Clonazepam (I'm prone to panic attacks under the influence of psychedelics and it's been awhile..) and 6g of seed paste coated in honey to mask taste. Went down smooth. Sipping glass of wine and creating music on Reason software.



3:30 pm



T:1:00



Starting to notice intial effects. Very interesting. Bowels going slack and palms starting to sweat slightly. Slight anxiety but the .05 clonazepam seems to have things going pretty mellow. Very similar to onsets of LSD. Started listening to: Grateful Dead Winterland Arena San Francisco, CA Date 10/17/78 -Sounding pretty nice and Discovery HD on TV w/ mute.



T: 1:15



Just drank the half the liquid in the bowl but pretty fucking nasty. It feels like I about to start tripping off maybe 1-2 hits of LSD.



4pm. 



T:1:30



Nothing much has changed. Maybe some nasuea due to the fact they are grilling tarantulas on Tv. Slight numbness in extremities. I hope I start tripping in the next hour, otherwise I've only slightly poisoned myself. Whole face is warm and tingling.



4:30 PM



T:2:00



Ingest another 1.5 gm of paste. Sharp pain in lower back but probably due to heavy lifting earlier today. Ingest 800 mg rx ibuprofen. Mild visuals beginning to take shape. walls breathing. Tv is becoming nauseating  and  bizarre and will most likely be turned off soon and replaced with Xbox 360 visualizer. Current images of wild boars being killed and barbequed. Images of a pigs in a slaughter house. Weird metaphors coming to mind. Empathy toward the animals.



Clammy plams and slight body load coming on. Heavier. Turned GD off for awhile to play with Reason software. Sounds amazing. Still feels like I'm gonna shit my pants any second but two trips to bathroom have yielded null amounts of waste. Smoke a small bowl of some decent cannabis, around .25 of gram.



5 pm.



T:2:30



`I need a miracle everyday'



Went to check mailbox: Looked at ocean. Horrible and powerful. I watch a lone surfer in the distance attempt and fail to catch a wave about 6 times. People walk by me with their dogs, etc but I don't even notice them. I feel as if invisible tiny antennae all over my body are beginning to receive signals of some type. The setting sun looks magnificent. I feel like an inhabitant of an alien world. 



Waves of euphoria. Maybe this is more like MDMA, MDA? I feel like a `member' of the planet. I feel great and confident, `smooth'. I'm not worried about anything. I stare at the sky for a good 5 minutes. It's 10x larger than usual. Being in the dusk sun light feels good. The sun rays feel like some kind of benevlont caress from some force that is usually unperceivable and always incomprehensible. Cannabis probably potentiating things.



6:00 pm



T: 3:00 



Back inside after watching sunset. I started to think about human life and how it doesn't coexist with nature. The plants on the cliff seemed more `alive' and have some kind of `life force' aura (lame, I know). I feel deep introspection and self-analysis taking place. I feel as if the planet is evaluating me and was about to make it's decision when the sun set. Heaven or Hell? I laughed out loud at my thoughts. Ridiculous.



Pop open a Lagunitas Ale 16 oz Frank Zappa Edition and Smoke a small bowl of some decent cannabis, around .25 of gram. GD show playing during `space' section. Weird as shit right now but as everything else right now, seem completely benevolent. I can feel sounds, drum beats, bouncing off everything in the room. I highly recommend this. Visuals are very mild but as I write this they are getting more intense. My field of vision is starting to get cluttered with breathing luminescent patterned quilts, not patterns but glowing lights. Mostly pleasant and almost narcotic-like body load feeling. Whole thing is coming in unpredictable waves. Holy shit I pretty much downed that beer in 10 minutes!!



6:45 pm:



T:3:45



Effects came on pleasantly for about 30 minutes consisting of open and closed eye visual patterns that are continuing now. For about 10 minutes shit got pretty intense and I took .25 of clonazepam as a safety net. Music sounding insanely cool, turned off all the lights and had some candles lit and was very nice. Mental state consisted of a cycle of confusion, amusement, guilt, and empathy. The effects seem to have peaked for now and I've come down a level, definitely since 45 minutes ago. I've heard this is how LSA goes, big build up then straight back down afterword. Overall I still feel good but some waves of  very mild headaches have come and gone over the last hour. Intrusive, or , `attacking' sounds are unpleasant. 



7:30:



T:4:30



Appetite coming back and a slight head ache but I blame the wine and beer more than the morning glories. Haven't eaten since 1 PM. Overall I am surprised at the positivity and relaxedness I felt throughout. I expected more anxiety and discomfort. Surprisingly almost no nausea or discomfort compared to most Internet reports. The onset and peak were euphoric and pleasant. The clonazepam was a small dose and took the edge off but I could have done without the wine and beer. They just gave me a nasty toxic feeling in comparison to the earthy, warm feeling I was experiencing. 



The visuals never got really intense but again I only took a purportedly small dose. The cannabis definently got things kicking for a good while also. I think the brand and variety of the seed is the key. I think I would eat the same brand of seed again but double the dosage. Even tomorrow.
