One fine summer afternoon, my friend and I were headed to my house to drop me off because she had to get to work. I asked her about the `valium' she bought and if she'd sell me a couple. I bought two for two dollars. When I got home. I looked up the pills on the internet to find that they weren't Valium, but were really Cyclobenzaprine. Oh well. I snorted one anyway.



I very clearly remembering that it hurt so much. My nose was on fire after snorting it. But less than one second later, I felt the effects. I got really sleepy, kinda felt like I was moving really slow. Felt like I was talking like I was really stoned. My brother got home, I asked him if I was talking weird or moving weird and he said no. I sat down on the couch and talked to him a bit about whatever. I couldn't get comfortable worth shit. I changed my position a thousand times. I just could NOT get comfortable at all. It was really frustrating. I felt really relaxed, yes, but I couldn't just get into the right position. It felt like I almost felt perfectly relaxed, but no, there was just one little thing that would make it imperfect and it frustrated me so much.



I was also feeling rather sleepy. My eyes felt like they were going to stay shut each time I blinked. I went ahead and went to my bed and slept for a good 4 or 5 hours. I had some really interesting dreams. That was the best part of this `high'. When I woke up, though, I was kinda groggy and still feeling it a very little bit. Later on that night I hung out with my friend who sold the pills to me. She said that she felt really weird and similar to how I felt. I've heard of people really enjoying them, though. And some people eat them like candy. I just don't particularly enjoy them. I'd only use them to help me sleep.
