 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\#  



This is more or less a post to explain how DXM has effected my brain over the course of the 2 and a half years or so I've been using it. Although it feels like its only been a few months.I was one of the huge group of silly types that used Coricidin C\&C, and oddly enough I never ran into any problems other then occasional throwing up and sweating. I never passed out, or bleed from my eyes or had to go to the hospital or any of that other horrid stuff that's been reported, and I was taking a LOT, upwards of like 32-64 tablets almost daily.



What negative effects it did have were more along the lines of long term sort of things. I really had what bordered on an addiction to it for a good part of 2001 and was using it every day, or at least 5 times a week or so. And although I never had any major bad experiances during those times,its the past year or so that I've realised how totally brain dead its made me. It's not so much even being `stupid' as it just feels like I'm never awake any more. Like I can't really feel emotion or relate to anything. Kind of like the walking dead.
