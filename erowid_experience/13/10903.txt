 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# 



The day started with a caffeine pill (200mg) in the morning to wake me up for school.  I got a pleasant feeling from it, and once it wore off around noon I took another.  That started the buzz again, and kept me energetic until about 8.  



I remembered I had some of those Coridicin Cough \& Cold pills in my dresser from a long time ago.  I thought I only had 4, but I found another half-package in there.  I figured what the heck, might as well get rid of all of them.  I took a caffeine pill at about 1:15 to make sure I would stay awake long enough for the DXM to kick in(in CCC it always takes an hour and a half almost on the dot).  Then at 1:45 I took 4 CCC, and every 5 minutes after took 4 more until they were gone (10 minutes total).



I chatted on IRC for quite a while.  There was no school the next day because of a snowstorm.  A friend signed on MSN and I talked with him all the way up until the DXM hit me.  I could feel it coming on, feeling good, no nausea whatsoever(unusual).  Then it kept getting stronger and stronger. 

 

I never felt anything like it before in my life.  Soon it was like I couldn't breathe.  I started panicking.  I stood up, and ran to the kitchen for some water. 



Amazingly I had no trouble with coordination, another unusual aspect of the trip.  

By the time I made it to the kitchen(like 7 feet away), and got a glass out of the cupboard, I couldn't hardly stand up.  I couldn't focus my eyes without really really trying.(never happened to me before)



Then I heard a REALLY loud ringing pulsing in my ears, and my whole head was throbbing.  By then my heart was racing a hundred miles an hour, and I thought I was going to die for sure.  I could barely manage to swallow any water, I almost gagged on it.  I decided I didn't want to pass out and make a huge noise in the kitchen, JUST IN CASE I somehow managed to make it through this.  



So I half-ran-stumbled (still couldn't focus) back to my room, and dove for my bed.  As soon as I hit the bed, I grabbed the blankets and wrapped them around me REALLY REALLY tight.  I don't recall doing this consciously, it just sort of happened.  And then I began to breathe huge breaths as fast as I could.  



And just like that it was over.  As soon as I started breathing really hard it just went away, and I was back to normal.  I was no longer feeling anything of the dxm except things still looked the way they do on DXM.  But my thoughts returned to my norm, and everything was ok.



This scared the living daylights out of me.  I will NEVER take CCC again, much less take caffeine before tripping on dxm.  I have tripped many a time on dxm, even those nasty CCC pills, and nothing even remotely like this has happened.  I was sure glad to be alive though.  I crashed about 2 minutes later and slept until 1:30pm.



The span of those events from the time I started panicking until the time it was all over was not even 5 minutes.  But I have never been so afraid in all my life.



The next day I was completely drained.  I didn't want to move at all.. all day long I just laid on the couch and watched TV.  Barely able to keep my eyes open.  I did take a few naps here and there for a few hours at a time each.  All in all, it was an experience I will never forget, and never want to repeat.
