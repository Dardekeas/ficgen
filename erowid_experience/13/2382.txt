11:45PM

-------

        I weigh out 50mg of Ketamine HCl which was obtained pure (not as

an injectible solution) from a chemical supplier. It is a crystalline

powder with some rather large chunks that look like crystals of table 

salt. I crush this to a fine powder, then further powder it with a razor

blade, and divide it into two even lines. This is about my 8th experience

with ketamine, though I've never written a report about it before. Looking

at this 50mg, it appears to be alot more than what I've done before.

Erowid's ketamine dosage page states `One method for nasal use is to

insufflate (snort) 25 mg in each nostril, wait 5 minutes and repeat until

you reach your desired dosage.' I do not anticipate that there will be any

need to repeat. Looking at this, I visually estimate that most of my prior

experiences have been with around 30-40mg.



12:00AM

-------

        I insufflate the first 25mg. There is a mild burn, but not too

bad. The file mentions doing 50mg at once. I've decided to space it

out somewhat and see how things work out.



12:03AM

-------

        I feel very noticable effects. My body begins to feel strange. My

head has a sort of `balloon-like' feel to it, its somewhat like nitrous

oxide without the sound in the head. Speaking of sounds\ldots  I put on

Orbital's live mix of `Halcyon On \& On'. Normally this song is very

pretty\ldots  but now, even with headphones, it sounds muffled or distant.

Ketamine certainly doesn't seem to enhance music - quite the opposite.



12:11AM

-------

        I am getting strange visual disturbances. Hard to explain really.

I have the impression that things are moving, but nothing looks as though

its moving. Corner-of-the-eye type stuff\ldots  but much more so. There is

a flittiness to the visual effects that is vaguely reminiscent (I was

completely unable to spell this word myself and had to ask for help on the

Internet) of the visual effects produced by ecstasy. My visual field is

swimming\ldots  thats the best word for it, somehow. As if looking at

everything through some kind of moving liquid.



12:18AM

-------

        There is a noticable drop in intensity of the effects. Visual

effects are still present. I still have a feeling of `dumbness' (not being

able to remember words, etc). In fact I am nowhere near baseline. But the

initial rush is over. My body feels `weird.' There are no closed eye

visuals.



12:30AM

-------

        I still feel a little unusual, and my visual field is still

swimming a little, but the effects are more or less over. 25mg remains

sitting on my plate. I'm not sure I want to do it\ldots  I feel as if I wasted

the first 25mg by sitting in front of a computer and trying to describe it

in realtime - as if the very act of attempting to describe the effects

prevents the more interesting effects form appearing.



12:40AM

-------

        I divided the remaining 25mg into 2 more lines, and put some Orb

on through headphones. I insufflate one of the 2 lines, then go to lay

down and close my eyes and listen to music.



12:45AM

-------

        No significant increase in effects from that  mg, so I insufflate

the other. I go back to laying down, after skipping to a different Orb

tune (Little Fluffy Clouds, Dance Mix MK2).



12:56AM

-------

        The song ends. I get up to start writing. My body feels somewhat

`detatched' - I can't quite explain it. Its not numbness per se, but

shares some qualities. Laying on my bed was very odd. The bed felt hard,

and the pillows felt hard, as if laying my head back on a cloth-covered

rock. The overhead light in my bedroom appears somewhat like the light

over an operating table. Not much in the way of closed eye visuals. Open

eyed, my room looks somewhat stark and my perspective seems odd. Is my

heart beating OK, am I breathing normal? I think. Don't really care. I

find myself thinking of mundane, every day issues, trying to find answers

to things which have been on my mind - no answers come to me that haven't

already come to me sober. I seem to be able to think about things in a

detatched, analytical way, but there is no enlightenment coming that I can

see. Most drug `spirits' I've dealt with have seemed to be male or female

- not so ketamine. The ketamine `spirit' seems robotic or mechanical in

nature. This molecule taps into some very different energies than the

traditional psychedelics. I would not consider this a psychedelic at all.

Its something else entirely.



1:08AM

------

        I feel I'm in approximately the same place as I was at the 12:18AM

entry above. Visual field is swimming. Feel physically weird\ldots a slight

sensation of motion, perhaps. Somewhat dulled sensation. Music sounds

mostly normal. But the mental effects have noticably dropped off. I feel

more `coherent' and though quite a ways above baseline, I'm definately

aware that I'm headed there.



1:20AM

------

        Visual effects are still quite noticable, though dramatically

less than what they were. Other effects are decreasing rapidly. I decide

to smoke some cannabis and conclude this experiment.



1:34AM

------

        I am on IRC\ldots  I just had a very intense deja vu experience. I

recieved 2 variations on the same chain email from 2 friends who are

totall unconnected (except through me). Then all of the sudden I realized

that the conversation I was having on IRC was something I had before. I

had the strange feeling that I existed in that time segment twice. Just

thought it was worth mentioning\ldots  Strange!
