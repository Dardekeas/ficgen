I just tried 2C-I for the first time.  I had read reports on the use of it online and also had read it was becoming a preferred club drug in the UK (instead of Ecstasy).  I am looking for something instead of E for clubbing, so I thought I would give it a try.  



I measured out 20 mg into a gel capsule and swallowed it with a little water.   This was at 4:50 pm and I had not eaten anything since lunch at noon.  I would describe my mindset as eager but anxious since it was the first time with this substance.  I was hanging out in my apartment for this trial, watching TV, listening to music or going online.



After about 45 minutes, I felt an alert that something was happening.  A definite increase in muscle tension in the body.  This continued to increase for the next hour, and sometimes muscles in my back, arms or face would clench briefly.  It wasn't very comfortable.  I felt like my breathing was being slowed, and I had to make a conscious effort to breathe adequately or it was too shallow.  



At about 2 hours, I began to notice a slow undulation in my field of vision, like I was looking at everything through a slow-motion rippling liquid.  Colors became more pronounced, like someone had turned up the contrast and brightness.  The unpleasant body effects faded and my body felt pretty normal, not speedy or buzzing, just normal.



Between the 2 and 3.5 hour mark, the visual perception effects peaked.  In addition to the rippling, I would see things stretch and shift and colors would be enhanced.  Nothing too vivid, but I could make it more intense by staring and concentrating.  When I looked in the mirror, it almost appeared that my pupils were slowing dilating and constricting as I watched, but I think it was a hallucination?  Note that I got a little pupil dilation but nothing really obvious like with `E'.  I had a couple phone calls during this time, and I was able to converse normally, with perhaps a little difficulty concentrating.  My body would alternate between feeling cold and hot.  I danced around my living room a little to some good trance :)



After 3.5 hrs the visual effects faded and I got ravenously hungry.   I felt pretty normal soon after that.



Overall, I would say this drug is not as suitable FOR ME for clubbing since it does not provide energy, nice body buzz or euphoria that I like.  My body didn't feel good coming up, and it takes a long time to come up (2+ hours).
