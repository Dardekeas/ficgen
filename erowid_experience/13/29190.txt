I am reasonably experienced in psychedelics and other substances, including ecstasy, and so I expected that a single dose would produce nothing more than euphoria and loving feelings.  



I took 1 pill of `blue torch' at about 7:10 p.m. with a friend on the same dose.  In about 10 minutes I complained that the effects were too strong, and had the usual uncontrollable eye saccades and waves of euphoria.  While this was not entirely unpleasant, I had a distinct feeling that the trip was getting away from me, that I could not control where my mind might go.  I got over this feeling in about 5 minutes and continued on a happy ride for about an hour.



My friend and I began to talk about spirits and the spirit world.  She mentioned that she saw a portal `to somewhere' in my bathroom.  Suddenly, that feeling that I could not control where my mind might go returned, and I spent the rest of the night guarding my home and us against the portal.  It was a negative experience that persisted for about 3 days, slowly decreasing in intensity.  I was very paranoid (of evil spirits and creatures from other dimensions, something I usually don't think about) and `slept' with the light on for several nights.  I was genuinely frightened that I would have permanent paranoia.  Weeks later I was more mellow but still having an occasional dream that something was invading my bedroom while I slept, or the experience of feeling watched by something with evil intentions. (I had not had such feelings before the trip.)



I submit this primarily because I have had many excellent drug experiences, including LSD and psilocybin, and a few moderately bad trips in which I was focused on death or sorrow, but nothing nearly this disturbing or persistent after the initial trip,  and nothing that I felt I could not talk myself out of or mentally lift up into a better trip until now. I share this information because I had believed that one could not have a `bad' trip on E, and I had believed that E was very easy to mentally control.  While I would definitely take E again, I will be a wiser and more cautious consumer.
