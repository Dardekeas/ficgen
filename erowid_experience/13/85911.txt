This report is of an experience which I made about half a year ago when I stayed with a friend for 2 weeks.



Well like everyone else I tried Spice because we ran out of weed and were not able to buy some. He still had a bag of Spice so why don't we use that? So we just rolled it up and smoked it like usual. First thing to notice: It tastes like shit. I would compare it to something like the smell of burning saltsticks or something like that.



Second thing: It somehow is comparable to THC but it didn't please me like weed does. It already starts with the bad taste, afterwards I felt kind of numb, but not the same `warm' feeling weed gives me. It also made me quite indifferent, what maybe helped when the last part of the Spice story kicked in.



Third thing, and also the reason why I wouldn't smoke it again: After 1 hour or so I had these symptoms someone in another experience report described as a flu without the joint-pain. I think that's what describes it best. It was also freezing cold even though the heater was turned to maximum and I was under a thick blanket. After some 20 minutes or so I successfully fell asleep and when I woke up everything was gone (luckily). It was exactly the same as the aftereffects of taking too much `Herbal Ecstasy' but without the puking. But that's another story\ldots  :)
