OK--read all the accounts on here, the extraction FAQ and was all primed to try this myself\ldots I had tried ingesting seeds, ground in my electric coffee grinder (washed, dried first!)\ldots using the table (light, medium, heavy doses) as a guide.  I believe I tried 100 seeds, then 200 seeds..the second time, I noticed the nausea, eventually the dry mouth and dilated pupils, but that was all. (I do not recommend soaking them in water after grinding--very unpalatable).



Did the extraction twice using naphtha and 151 proof rum using roughly 8 then 10 grams of seeds--noticed nothing.  Finally ingested 15 grams of seeds, grinding them in my grinder and mixing the seeds in with apple sauce--went down very well!  Had some nausea, very tolerable and ultimately that went away after eating a full meal\ldots  several hours later found myself sitting at a performance of Tibetan monks who chanted (I did NOT drive there)\ldots I was on the edge of a flat out trip, almost having visual changes, but the auditory part was intense!



Well, buoyed by this sucess, I ground up $>$13 grams of seeds, ate them with apple sauce and washed it all down with a big ol' can of LaBatt's Ice beer\ldots  when the nausea kicked AND the pupils dilated, I ate again and the nausea abated.  I did that at 2pm, by 5pm, I had the slight tremor and was pretty sweaty\ldots  by 7pm, things around me appeared to `breathe' in sync with my breathing, had handlable visual changes and listened to Enigma's `Cross of Changes' CD with mindblowing results.



The beauty of all this was that I was in control the whole time, if I needed to be with the moment, I was\ldots coherent, lucid\ldots if I let myself go, then the visual changes would go and my vision would `swim' and other cool effects.



One method that works:  grind up in excess of 10 grams (rinsed and patted dry with paper towels) using the Pearly Gates variety and use apple sauce as a vehicle.  Wash it all down with a can or two of beer or other moderate amount of alcohol, wait until pupils dilate before eating and plan on actually tripping 4-5 hrs after you eat it.



It was very enjoyable for me, and while it seems like a little bit of work (it really isn't, compared with the extraction), it is legal.  Happy voyaging!
