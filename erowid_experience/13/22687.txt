A few weeks ago my friend Bellman gave me a bottle of what I thought was 5-MeO-DiPT, he told me there were 4 doses in the bottle and that I should only drink one 4th of the bottle. Later that night I went to chill with my friends Schuy, and Jeff.  We had been looking for foxy for a long time and we were VERY happy that we finally found it. so at around 11 we dosed after taken a few hits off a blunt, Schuy and I drank down my 6mg in a little under an hour, Jeff drank his in a half hour.  Immediately after each sip we felt the 5-MeO-AMT hit our brains, each time getting slightly more awkward feeling. We had a fun time for about an hour, and then thought we were coming down, little did we know he hadn't even peaked yet.  



About 30 minutes later we thought we were coming back up, but we were just coming up for the first time, it took about 2 hours to peek.  At first I didn't realize how fucked up I was.  When I stood up my legs had fallen asleep, suddenly I had the idea that I was paralyzed from the waist down, and my legs didn't work at all!  Slowly I tried to move each leg so I could lie down; instead I hit the floor and completely lost it, my chest hurt from how hard I was laughing.  Jeff left the room right after and started throwing up; he remained in the bathroom for the majority of the hard trip.  Schuy and I stayed with him till he recuperated around 5am. 



Another friend of ours was with us on DXM, and he was pissing us off because he got mad that we took the blanket he was using (Jeff was too hot and too cold) Alex started yelling and I don't know if it was the drug or if it was me, but Schuy and I just started going off on him, and we said some really mean things.  We didn't even remember what we said after it was all said and done.  At around 7am we were all feeling good, Jeff felt a lot better, we had realized then that Jeff took an Excedrin before dosing, we think that might have been the reason that he was throwing up, and had such a bad trip.  



Schuyler also puked, but he was done with that in like 5 minutes. During the hardest part of our trip Schuy wanted to puke but I told him that he was more experienced in the realm of hallucinogens and that, if anyone shouldn't be puking it was him.  Fortunately for me I had no negative side effects from the 5-MeO-AMT other then a headache, but that was from lack of sleep I think.  



We dosed at Jeff's in his room, on a huge mattress that could hold like 5 people.  Like I was saying at 7 we felt good, so we smoke like 4-5 blunts, the high from each blunt felt like it was only 15 minutes. From 7-11 we had the worst case of ADD ever! Every 10 minutes we would say `5 - M e O -D I P T, It's an R C, Acid Jr.' Acid Jr. Came up a lot because it just sounded so ridiculously funny.  `Acid for dummies' was another name we gave it.  



We felt ridiculously stupid during this time, and we really couldn't shut up, we dubbed our other friend Alex the foxy poster child.  The stupidity we felt was so intense, I can't emphasize enough how dumb we felt and were.  I didn't completely sober up until the next day around 11am. The morning before I dosed I took my SSRI 50mg Fluvoxamine, and 10mg Dexedrine.  The next day I found out that we didn't dose 5-MeO-DiPT but that it was 5-MeO-AMT.
