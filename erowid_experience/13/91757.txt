 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:PACKAGED\_PRODUCTS\_VARY\#\#  



I just recently discovered research chemicals, I started making my own K2 with AM-2201. While I was at the local head shop buying some flavoring drops for my synthetic pot I saw some so-called charlie sheen novelty powder I bought 1g for 40\$. When I got home I did a giant line about 100mg.



10 min pass and I feel like I just did some real good coke



After 30 min pass I got a amphetamine like euphoria which only lasts for about 20 min and turns into paranoia almost psychosis like



1 hour after ingesting 100mg I'm getting the urge to re-dose. 



8:00 I do another 100mg line



11:00 After about 3 hours pass I convince myself to go to bed, I'm wanting to do another 100mg line but hold off and try to get some sleep. I do about a 50mg line before going to lie down.



12:30 As I'm laying still in bed I start to get the meth bugs. I couldn't believe how powerful this stuff is. I lay in bed for the next 8 hours unable to fall asleep, listening to my heartbeat race at 140 beats per min

  

Tomorrow rolls around, I didn't get none but 2 hours of sleep. I  am going to dispose of this devilish drug its probably one of the most unpleasant stimulants I've ever come across.



I will never touch this drug again as I find it to be extremely addictive, just almost comparable to methamphetamine or cocaine



STAY AWAY FROM THE BATHSALTS
