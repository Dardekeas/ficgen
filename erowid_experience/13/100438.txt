As a user of many illicit drugs and substances from marijuana to MDMA, I'm used to feeling very withdrawn from friends and family. But one day after withdrawing for 3 Days from Buprenorphine I was extremely down and out. I wandered through a friend's house and found a bottle of Baclofen. Being that i had no money, and or resources I quickly decided to look them up. I found it was a drug used as a muscle relaxant and muscle spastic medicine. 



So as doing was most fiends would do in this situation, I took 5 of these 20 mg Tablets. Within an hour i started to feel a bit of euphoria. The onset of euphoria quickly turned to dizziness followed by unbalance and hunger. I was very pleased to find that even after 4 hours of feeling very intense euphoria It was still increasingly growing stronger. I began to lose control of my bodily movements and was very un-alert. I began to fall down and also started getting the feeling of nausea. Even after eating all day and getting sick for a few hours and sleeping for a few, I still woke up feeling euphoria. All in all it was a very strange experience and would do it again. It was a feeling like no other, like nothing i had ever experienced.



Please note to take responsibly and do not overdose as i did on your first time taking them.
