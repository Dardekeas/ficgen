To start I'd like to provide some background information. My first intoxication ever was 2c-e, and I loved it(which was 3 years ago when I was 15). To this day I'm a college student and a huge student with a free spirit and intellectual mind. Okay, now to the day. It was me, my best friend and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend and I were the ones that took a blotter of 600ug 25c-nBOME. We were in a random hotel in Philadelphia. We dropped the blotters at 2:00 pm.



2:00pm: I stick my blotter between my upper lip and gum and wait.



2:15pm: my lip is almost completely numb and the skin where the blotter was feels really raw and tender. Very uncomfortable.



2:30pm: I can't feel my upper and lower lips and even my upper and lower gums all the way back to my molar teeth. At this point I knew I was about to trip crazy hard.



2:45pm: My lip is still very uncomfortable. It was so numb it felt like I had gotten shot up with Novocaine. I take out my blotter and throw it away and already I had Electrical impulses shooting though the surfaces of my skin. I was feeling good.



3:00pm: I was laying in the hotel room staring at the ceiling and it looked as though it was dripping down on me. The surface was rippling like water and dripping off. My body felt like a generator or something that had a lot of electrical power running through it. Like if the television was plugged into my body and would power it.



3:30pm: The surface of my skin had a mild sweat to it but it didn't bother me much. I distinctly remember my feet and hands being very cold tho. I recommend a warm environment. But at this time My friend who also took it was starting to act very strange. Pacing a lot, looking very confused and not happy, so I went to comfort him and spread some positive energy (note he is just as experienced as I am when it comes to psychedelic drugs).

 

4:00pm: I was having a great time, my body felt like every inch was orgasming and my vision was completely distorted with amazing color and cartoon looking things. If you have ever seen the tapestry called `yes yes yes no no no', my visuals had that theme to it on everything. 



4:30pm: Time is moving very slow. I started to feel restless and wanted something, but I was tripping so hard, there wasn't much I could be doing. This bothered me a bit because for some reason I  felt like I was wasting away. Although my best friend comforted me and we all talked for a bit.



5:00pm: My visuals or body sensation has not died down at all. In fact it felt like it was infinatly increasing. I was loving it. I distinctly remember seeing a bunch of cartoon  faces all up and down my arms that we constantly changing facial expressions. Like flashing from on to the next when suddenly the all started to just stare at me. Their eyes got really big and exploded into colorful spirals that shot a crossed the room. I was Visually stunned and straight up hallucinating. Some of the strongest visuals that my eyes have ever seen, and they have seen some trippy shit.



7:00pm: We decide to break out the weed. We go into the bathroom of the hotel and hotbox then bajeebies out of it. The first hit I took instantly took me too an entirely new level of tripping. I began seeing colors I have never seen before on. Everything became very arborescent. All objects around me began to sprout colorful branches that whipped in every direction. It was truely amazing.



7:30pm: My best friend was feeling very home sick so we decided to start our 2 hour car ride back to southern central Pennsylvania, leaving her boyfriend in the room. He said he insisted on us leaving and him being alone, so we let him. He for sure was not having the same great time that I was having, but I have no idea what he experienced. 



8:00pm: We are on the road driving home, I was starting to feel a comedown but we smoked and it came right back.



10:00pm We finally get to her house. I don't remember much from the car ride other then starring in amazement at the outside world contorting and being livid and so full of neon color.



10:30pm: I'm still feeling residual effects. Nothing was contorting anymore and there were no more cartoons or hallucinations but rather a very colorful overlayed grid on  everything I looked it. It was still a very nice sight to see. I was laying in bed waiting for sleep to come.



I woke up the next day with full memory of the previous day and memories of very vivid dreams. At the time the experience was so strong I layed off psychedelics for a bit, just because I had my fill and had no desire to trip. Today, 3 months later I am feeling very enthusiastic and have some 25c-nBOME and plan on having another colorful, astral, euphoric night. 25c-nBOME was a very, non spiritual, fun/goofy trip.
