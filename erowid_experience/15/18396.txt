A while back I was fortunate enough to be seeing a psychiatrist who supplied me with Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts), Xanax (alprazolam), and Klonopin (clonazepam) all at once.  At that time, I only saw the doctor for the sake of getting these pills, which I and my girlfriend used heavily on a daily basis.  



At first, we used the Adderall and the benzodiazepines separately, because we thought that the two, which essentially have opposite effects, would cancel each other out and not be worth using in combination.  We did, however, regularly use the benzos to practically eliminate the unpleasant `coming down' at the end of a day of Adderall use.  Instead of feeling emotionally upset, physically exhausted, and mentally blank when the amphetamine wore off, we felt instead unbeleivable relaxed, happy, and fully capable of sleeping!  This gave me the idea of finally taking the risk and combining the two at once.



We used the drugs every day in order to study both school material and personal interests, do our everyday chores, and then to relax.  We were using so heavily that we basically lived in a distant fantasy world and progressively lost our sense of direction in school (and life), became more and more unhealthy physically, and became emotional train wrecks.  Finally we had to stop; I'm still amazed that we made it through together.  I don't recommend getting hooked on these pills, if you can help it.



As for dosage, the chemicals synergize so well that the exact numbers are really up to the user.  As for myself, I was at that time addicted to Adderall (I used about 10 20mg tablets of it every day for several months, give or take a tablet) and equally attached to benzodiazepines.  We were both using at least 5mg of Xanax daily usually 7-10mg along with at least 5mg of Klonopin.  We were able to use it so liberally because we had accumulated an excess of all of them since we didn't use them at all for about 5 months after I started receiving them.  We were also smoking marijuana quite heavily.



I'll do my best to describe the synergized effects of using Xanax and/or Klonopin simultaneously with Adderall.  When I use Adderall by itself, especially in large doses, the soaring, euphoric stimulation is accompanied by uncomfortable effects such as muscle tension, perhaps a little trembling or difficulty taking deep breaths, sensations of bodily weakness, nervousness, etc.  Xanax COMPLETELY eliminates these effects; I'm not kidding!  They disappear without a trace.  All I'm left with is the desirable effects of amphetamine: the feelings of emotional well-being, amazing intellectual ability, and boundless yet controllable energy are not diminished at all.



But the Xanax does more than just cancel out the negative side of Adderall.  Alone, Xanax (and other benzodiazepines) makes me impervious to agitation, intimidation, anxiety of any kind: I feel completely serene in all circumstances.  However, large (say 3+mg of  Xanax) doses will inevitably lead to passing out, often even if I try to fight it.  When I wake up, I remember nothing!  Well, the Adderall eliminates the overwhelming desire for sleep and preserves my memories without diminishing at all the complete relaxation.  



Therefore if I take large amounts of both drugs at once I will increase strong positive effects from both while simultaneously eliminating their respective negative effects.  The synergy is amazing; the two produce a third drug which is better than either alone.
