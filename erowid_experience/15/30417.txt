I thought whippits were safe, as I had done research and found out that it is even administered to pregnant women to help with their birth pains. So I had no problem filling a balloon with 2 cans of N2O and inhaling it until losing conscoiusness.  The echoing in the ears, the fading out of consciousness, it all seemed too good to be true.  It was.



The problem with how I took the whippits was that I didn't know my body was oxygen deprived, and because I did so many, I have effects of it to this day.  I will every now and then just shake/have a tremor which is very embarassing and I try my hardest to suppress, but it's like I've damaged the part of my brain that controls muscle movements so it's involuntary.  



I just want first timers/long timers to know that they should inhale and exhale into the balloon, then take a breathe of normal air, then into the balloon again in a pattern so they don't get too oxygen deprived. I haven't done N2O going on a year now and regret doing them at all. On a good note I'm slowly recovering from this and shake less and less. I guess my main point is please enjoy them in moderation, it's not worth fucking up your brain over!
