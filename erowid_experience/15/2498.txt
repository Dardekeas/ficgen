I was going to a Rave, I hadn't consumed anything except liquids all day.  I took AMT an old friend had given me, a couple hours before another friend was to pick me up.  He claimed it was like DMT, with an Amphetamine ring around the molecule.



7:30 p.m. I dipped my pinky into the little aluminum fold I had, and put it in my mouth, it tasted really funny (but oddly familiar), I wanted to start conservative with a strange drug.  About an hour later, I started feeling it come up.  It made my eyes flutter like MDMA is supposed to. Then about 15 minutes later I started feeling sick.  Real sick.  Different than throwing up on E, more like being sickly drunk.  I couldn't stop dry heaving.  Finally that subsided, so I sat and drank water.  And noticed the watery psychedelic effects of my red curtains.



One thing that distinguises AMT from LSD is the ease of communication.  So that when my friend picked me up to go, he didn't even know that I was seriously and increasingly getting intoxicated.  We where driving in his huge station wagon, that floated like a boat.  He had just gotten off work and wanted to get a Sub Sandwich.  So we drove uptown, and I was trying hard to not throw up, but I did anyway into my backpack.  Finally, I decided there is no way in hell that I can go to the party, I told him to drive me home.



10:30p.m - When I got home I just sat and listened to music.  Which sounded very tight.  The effect kept getting stronger.  I started hearing this humming sound.  There seemed to be a light shining above me.  And I kept turning to look at it.  I did get a jaw clenching effect.  At the peak of it I was hearing this popping sound and crackling.  Immediatly I knew it was the sound I had read about from Terrence McKenna describing DMT.  It felt as if my conciousness was splitting.  And it was if the popping was more REAL than anything I was seeing or feeling, as if it all where shattering from the sound. This lasted for about 5 minutes.  It was a bit overwhelming.  I was'nt grounded enough for that strong of an experience.  The comedown lasted for another five hours, I just laid in bed.  

It made me scared honestly, that this strong of a drug isn't illegal, made me wonder if it's an MK-Ultra type drug.  It probably would have helped having someone there to comfort me.  



I havn't done it in three months.  And don't plan on it anytime soon.  But I wouldn't rule it out forever.  It should be done with proper set and setting which I might not have had at the time.  But parts of it were incredibly interesting.  It probably would be real nice to have a tiny bit WITH Ecstacy, to kick it in the butt.  It had a similar trance as Crystal, Acid, and MDMA all ROLLED into one!!
