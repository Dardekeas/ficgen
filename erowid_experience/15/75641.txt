I have experience the bliss of pure 5 meo dmt when u used to b able to order the shit online but congress took care of that (jerks) but with enough reshearch and a cover of a exotic reptile dealer i was able to obtain 2 big ass bufo alvarius toad i suspose a male and a female (never had any baby toads)i experemented with serveral methods of milking the toads and found that a large piece of glass 4 foot by 2 foot helped alot to catch the vemon as i said before these guys were fricking huge and spat vemon that would put ron jeremy to shame. that said the vemon was squrtd onto the glass and dried with a heat lamp after the stuff dried it was scraped with a razor.



anyway the vemon was smoked off of tin foil similar to the way one would smoke heroin and man did it work after like 5 second the experementie fell over and began laughing for like 20 minutes. seemed like fun 



MY TURN i loaded up a little less and let it burn it tastd like burning my nikes and burnd my lungs but before i knew it my ass was on the floor it hard to desride but my whole body was vibrating definitly one of the most intense feeling around but no real hallucinations within 10 minutes the vibration where gone and withi 20 stone cold sober. looks like i found the goose who laid the golden egg, anyway have fun out there and stay safe
