I took an overdose of hydergene accidentally. I had been taking about 3 mg a day and then took 13.5 mg in one day. I took:

4.5 mg hydergine

800 nootropil

750 aniracetem

2 shots of minirin

3 times a day



I felt sick, dizzyness, trouble breathing, stuffed up nose, exhaustaion, insomnia, and more. But! My depression broke for the first time I was thinking logically, and making good decisions. I had a food of memories, and felt optimistic for once. I cut back to:

2.25mg hydergine

400 nootropil

and 350 aniracetem 

3 to 4 times a day



I have finally cleaned myself up, took my first shower in two weeks, washed my clothes. The first week I was on it I went on threee dates prior to that I had been  moping about my ex for 5 months. I was planning on killing myself this summer. I even drank the champagne I had intended for my last toast.



I love this cocktail of drugs. FOr the first time I feel like a complete person. I think it is mainly the hydergine that is working it is fat soluble if I don't take it with fats I get depressed again. My libido's up and my anhedonia is gone I want pleasure. Thank you Sandoz you saved my life.
