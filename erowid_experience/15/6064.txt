I'm 15 years old now but I was 14 when this happened. I've done a variety of other drugs such as ketamine, coke, weed, ecstasy, and LSD but have never had a reaction like this before. I was attending a party with my older brother and some of my other older friends who I had done coke and ketamine with. I never really felt good about going to parties with people who were all older than me (average age being probably 18 or 19) so I decided to phone a friend and ask him to come along. His sister was also attending so it all worked out. When we got there I saw a few unfamiliar faces and asked Jason (my brother) who they were. He told me to mind my business so I left it alone. About an hour into the party my friend who I had phoned to come along came up to me with a very worried look on his face. I asked him what was wrong and he told me he was leaving because he had heard that people were going to be shooting H and he didn't want to be around. I told him not to be a baby and that he didn't have to do it, all he had to do was pass. He said `no' and left. 



Everyone was sitting in a circle so I went to join them. Everybody was so cool, it was like a big happy family. It was then that I saw some guy I didn't know pull out a needle and say something like `anyone want to try some H? Believe me if you try it you will never want to do any other drug.' I listened to his little speech and watched a few people shoot it up. My brother told me that when he got to me to refuse. Jason then got up and went to the kitchen to get a bite to eat. When the guy with the H got to me, my brother was still gone. He said `So little man you wanna hit this?' I looked around at the others and they looked so happy. I thought what the hell I'm not going to get addicted the first time. I replied `sure dude, but will you help me? I've never shot H before.' `Of course I will' he said, with a big smile on his face. He tied some plastic wrap shit around my arm and shot it. I immediately felt sick. I felt like I had to throw up. I went to the bathroom but I couldn't throw up so I came back to the living room and sat down. I totally blacked out. The next thing I know I saw a bright light and heard melodic voices. I know it sounds like I'm crazy but I think I went to heaven and back. 



Anyway when I woke up I was in a hospital bed with my mom and brother hovering over me. All I could think was `Oh shit Oh shit what the fuck am I going to say?' My mom was crying and my brother looked disappointed. I said `Mom someone must have put something in my drink.' `That's what I was thinking at first and then the doctor told me that you shot heroin into your arm. What the hell have you done?' she said. `I'm sorry' I said. I couldn't say anything else, I had royally fucked up and I knew it. The doctor came in with a cop and the cop asked me who I got it from. I looked at my brother and his eyes were huge and he was shaking his head. I replied `I don't know his name and I can't remember what he looked like.' My brother also said he didn't know the guy. That night I learned not to fuck with shit when I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm not trying to preach or anything but I hope this is a lesson to anyone thinking about heroin. 

Peace, Bj
