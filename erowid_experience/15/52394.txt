I had 3 25mg Amitriptyline pills I decided to try them. I did this around 10.00 AM, I had a empty stomach so I ate half of a power bar and a banana. I took 3 pills but had a hard time getting them down, I usually can get pills down really easily but yesterday I was gagging and shit. I wasn't really paying attention to when I took them but I was thinking probably about 1 1/2 hours before it hit me. I ordered pizza which I  forgot about then it hit me before the pizza came I was super drowsy. The pizza guy came and I could hardly walk to the door. I ate some pizza and went to bed. 



When I woke up I was super dizzy but for some reason it was fun. At about 2.30 PM my mom picked me up to take me to her house. When I got there I slept I woke up around 5.00 when my dad picked us up. Then came the comedown stomach hurt like a bitch shiting like crazy. But the overall I liked the Amitriptyline experience.
