I discovered Syrian Rue through the book `Legal Highs' before the Internet was born and Ayahusca mixtures were well documented in the USA.



I was very experienced with weed, alcohol, mushrooms and LSD. I knew what an intense hallucinogenic experience was like.



Preparation: I smashed  the 7 grams wrapped in newspaper with a claw hammer. I placed the results in about 2 liters of water and boiled it for well over an hour. The mixture was filtered through a regular paper towel. It had the yellow green color of anti-freeze. I boiled the mixture down to a juice glass sized portion. The mixture seemed to glow with a yellowish-green light of its own.



I took a visiting friend home as I didn't want to drive after taking the mixture. When I returned I promptly drank the mixture. It smelled and tasted (I imagine) like a tomato vine smells when it is crushed.



Let me specify what I had done wrong before this experiment. 



The night before I had eaten chicken cordon bleu (blue cheese is an no no) and gotten quite drunk on alcohol (another big no no). 



Within ten minutes of drinking the mixture I knew I had seriously screwed up. The neighbor's lawn mower was sounding as it always did and then very quickly the sound blended with every other sound in the universe into a cosmic familiar `OM'. 



Five minutes later I was upstairs pacing the hallway in a panic. I was dizzy and becoming nauseated very rapidly. 



At 20 minutes into the trip the vomiting began with no warning. I spewed for what seemed like hours while my closed eye visuals quickly overwhelmed me. I couldn't handle the input my open eyes provided me and when they were closed I was seeing an endless stream of eyeballs coming directly at me and felt them passing through my head. 



I was lying face down on the bathroom floor finding some comfort in the coolness of the tile. I was not even trying to hit the toilet when I puked anymore. My brother asked me if I felt like I had been poisoned and needed to go to the hospital. I said yes but there was nothing the ER could do for me (I have no idea if that is true). 



He left the house so he wouldn't be responsible for my death if that happened. That's just the way he was back in the day. As he left I heard the car leaving the driveway and at the same time I was looking down from the sky watching his car driving away as if I were a bird flying over the house viewing the whole scene from the sky. 



The interesting part of the experience was that I could leave my sickened body at will and experience other cartoonish realities and then snap back into my body and promptly vomit again. My visions were set in the jungle and the dessert. I would feel sand between my toes then I was back in my bed and I would immediately throw up on my bedroom carpet.



All in all I was gravely ill for about eight hours. 



Years later I tried the substance again but heeded the warnings about dangerous combinations of food, alcohol etc. This time it wasn't sickening like before but also there weren't the hallucinations, OBEs or near death experience.



I would not recommend trying this to anyone. I am sure I am lucky to be alive.
