Note: I am a spiritual person, and often use entheogens as a tool for enlightenment. I have frequently done TM while using entheogens, much to my delight. I am also rather experienced, and do not have a tendency to be overwhelmed or spun the wrong way. I decided to try Kratom for the first time. I hadn't seen it around my area much, but then it showed up, so I figured this would be a good time as any. I did my research first, then made a extract juice from the Kratom. Orange juice goes quite well, I could not notice the bitterness one bit. After gulping it down, I rinsed the cup with cold water and drank that too.



T+0:10 I pack up a bowl and proceed to smoke the cannabis, which adds a nice glow to anything. I smoke the same amount every hour or so. I also put on some music, Umphrey's McGee live shows. I get a Mountain Dew from the fridge and drink that.



T+0:20 I get a charger of nitrous out and take it in one breath, making sure I'm carefully near soft things. The combination is obviously much different than cannabis and nitrous alone, which I found to be quite pleasurable. I inhale more chargers about every 15 minutes.



T+2:00 I am soaring on the Kratom right now. I know what the cannabis and nitrous are adding to it, so I can still focus on what its doing to me. I'm getting all the tell-tale signs: energy but sedation, fast thought and conversation, warm glow, etc. I guess the cannabis and nitrous are beginning to add up, because I am going into little 5 second OEVs and CEVs. Nothing too profound or anything, just patterning and whatnot. I've had 4 Mountain Dews now, and I don't oft drink caffeine.



T+2:15 After taking another nitrous and feeling full of energy, I decide to pack up my bong instead of my bowl. I split the pack 50/50 cannabis and 20x salvia extract. I know that salvia has worked for me before as a meditative agent, but I want to see the combinations it can make. I smoke the whole thing in 3 or 4 hits to make sure I held the most possible smoke for the salvia. After completing this, I rinsed out the piece and set it back where it belongs. I notice a bit of coordination loss, but shrug it off and continue to rock out to Umphrey's.



T+2:30 I take another nitrous and I almost immediately lose my mind. Up this point, I felt I had a grasp on what my mind was telling me, and thought I was learning substantial information. At this exact moment the nitrous hit my brain however, I lost it.



*Everything after this point was recorded after the event, so details may suffer as a result. Condolences.*



I got up to tell my roommate exactly what was going on with me, but the act of standing and walking over there made me nauseated. I rushed back to my bed, tossed the headphones in, and separated from my body.



I don't just mean got relaxed, I mean I felt myself exit my body and float up into another realm. I've had out of body experiences before, and this was completely different. At that time, I equated it to the feeling a dying person must have right as they pass. This made me freak out, since then I thought I was dead. I calmed myself down, even though I couldn't open my eyes to make sure I was still on earth. 



T+2:45 After what seemed like a lifetime of struggle, I managed to get my eyes open for a split second, since the light is blinding. It reaffirms to me, however, that I am still alive. I close my eyes again and see vivid images of people I know doing very uncharacteristic things (Prude friend as a stripper, e.g.).



T+3:30 The music ends on my headphones, which leaves me in a dark place. So I open my eyes, throw the headphones to the ground, and roll onto my side. I had previously been on my back. I now live in this CEV world, and it doesn't bother me anymore. I should note that I have never had a bad trip before, so if this was one I didn't know. It felt disturbing to me, but not directly malevolent.



T+7:00 Apparently I was gone longer than I realized. I thought that I had only closed my eyes again for no more than 30-40 minutes, and here I am nearly four hours later.

At this point, I am nearly back to baseline, although still feeling a bit fuzzy and warm. I am going to sleep.



I woke up the next day with no hangover at all! I think that Kratom is a truly amazing thing. It took what I was already familiar with and made it all new to me.
