I would like to start by advising anyone who takes beta-blockers and SSRI's not to take Risperidone. However, this is my first time with an anti-psychotic drug, and so the hellish side-effects may subside with repeated use and tolerance. 



I obtained 60 1 mg pills, and had already read through the side effects but thought nothing of them. 



9:00am - After taking my daily dose of Propranolol and Lustral, I decided to put a 1mg pill down the hatch. Little did I know of what this tiny fragment of chalk had in store for me. Feeling nothing whatsoever for the first hour.



10:00am - I am now noticing a sedate but not sleepy feeling ensuing. Late for college and a session in the recording studio, I hurry down as quick as possible. By the time I get there the effects are coming on heavy. It is a silently peaceful spasticated feeling. At this time I am still skeptical and put it down to lack of sleep.



10:30am - Sitting in the recording studio with my fellow collaborator, I am having extreme difficulty concentrating on what he's saying. To me it's just `bla blallab bla bal. balba balbb bla', and Im staring at him with this fixed expression completely aware of my ridiculous state. I am now aware that that my eyes are physically out of sync: I have trouble looking at anything and I am physically cross-eyed. 



10:45am - Trying desperately to make head or tail of this song we are producing, we call in another producer. I tell them what I've taken and they just laugh in my face. By this stage I cannot think straight at all and I have real bad cotton-mouth. I desperately need a drink, and I am getting hot and cold flushes all over. I stumble out of the studio into the hallway to get some air. 



11:00am - I am still monging in the hall. The producer comes out and starts talking technical bollox to me, but it's as if my universal translator has just switched itself off. I notice everything goes quiet and I realize I'm going to faint, before falling to the floor. I open my eyes and I'm on my knees. The producer is sting babbling technical shite, obviously completely oblivious to my fainting. Im laying there at his feet pondering the situation; I figure it must be the combination of the beta-blockers' anti-hypertensive effect and the intitial blood pressure lowering effect of the Risperdal combined. Maybe that explains looking boss-eyed. Miss-co-ordination when walking.



11:10am - Sod the recording session. I feel so fucked up now I just want to go home.



The effects are at max, `and they give this shit to mental patients' I think to myself. I will just go lay down and ride it out. Lost my appetite completely.



Stupid fuck that I am, I decide to give it one more go the next day, just to check it wasn't an anomaly. A few seconds after ingestion I realize what a cunt I am, and try to regurgitate to no effect. Once in the blood, a panic attack ensues, followed by another, followed by another. All I can think is how shit a day I'm going to have. Then I realize I'm scheduled for work this evening. What a stupid prick. However, it made the work pass without bore, so could be a good drug to go to work on? I doubt it!



The moral here is, think twice before taking anti-psychotics whilst taking beta-blockers and anti-depressants.
