Background: I'm 20 years old, in OK physical/mental shape, and I don't use any drug with any sort regular frequency. Rarely do I do any drugs at all at this point in my life.



Normally, I have a hard time getting to sleep. It takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to get so sleep after going to bed, usually.



In short, my `sleeping schedule' is all fucked up. When I have no commitments and I just go to sleep when I'm tired, I end up staying up for about 20 hours and sleeping for around 10 hours. I also tend to be awake more at night and less during the day. My body seems to be happy with this schedule, but socioty does not.



So, I decided to try some melatonin for a while to see if it will help me. I've been getting to bed around 5:00 AM for the last 3 nights (it was a weekend), and I have work tomorrow at 1:00 PM.



These are my notes on 1-day-short-of two weeks of using 1mg melatonin sublingual tablets as a sleep aid.



May 31 @ 2:50 AM

1mg melatonin sublingual

May 31 @ 3:30 AM

Another 1mg melatonin sublingual

Fell asleep: $\sim$4:00 AM



June 1 @ $\sim$3:00 AM

2mg melatonin sublingual

Fell asleep: $\sim$4:00 AM



June 2 @ 2:30 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

I'm finally tired @ 2:51 AM

Fell asleep: $\sim$3:10

I am very tired upon waking.



June 2 @ 2:11 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

Fell asleep: $\sim$2:30

I am extremely tired upon waking.



June 4th @ 2:20 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

Fell asleep: $\sim$3:00 AM

I am very tired upon waking.



June 5th @ around 4: something AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

Fell asleep: around 5:00 - 6:00 AM 

I am very tired upon waking.



June 6th @ 3:30 AM

3mg melatonin sublingual

I am suddenly tired at 3:45 AM, went to bed.

No notes written down.



June 7th @ 1:00 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

I awoke 6 to 7 hours later not `groggy' or tired.



June 8th @ 1:50 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

I didn't get to sleep for at least 45 minutes.

I slept 12 hours.

I am very tired upon awaking.



June 9th @ 4:09 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

I went to bed at 4:14 AM.

I have to get up at 8:00 AM.

I slept 4 hours and got up, a little bit (but not very) tired.



June 10 @ 1:19 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual (after not sleeping all day)

I have to get up $\sim$7:30 AM.

I got $\sim$5-6 hours of sleep.

I was tired most of the day after waking up.



June 11 @ 3:05 AM

4mg melatonin sublingual

June 11 @ 3:20 AM

1mg melatonin sublingual

I become tired @ 3:41 AM and go to bed. 

I obtained sleep @ 4: something AM.

I got up @ 1:00 PM, but could have sleep for many hours more.

I am very tired upon awaking. 



June 12 @ 5:52 AM

2mg melatonin sublingual

I'm tired anyway, but I'm taking two.

Thank God I don't have work tomorrow.



Basically, this stuff isn't helping, or I'm becoming too tolerant. It would be OK if I wasn't so tired in the mornings.

I noticed no diffence in the frequency or vividness of my dreams when I was taking it from when I wasn't.



Once this bottle runs out, I'm not buying another, but I'll use it untill it's all gone.
