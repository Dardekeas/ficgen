I had read that it was recommended to fast 12 hrs before taking 5meodipt, and that's what I did.  Of course I counted sleeping hours, which were 8, I got up at 6 am, and took approx 40 mg of 5 meodipt without having consuming anything except coffee\ldots   10 minutes later, while I was still having a cup of coffee, I noticed that my t-shirt was soaked with sweat.  I thought, that's odd, couldn't possibly be the 5meodipt, because that takes 2 hours\ldots Wrong!  The 5 meodipt it was.  I didn't have to wait long for the visuals, they came on with enormous power:  Almost everything I looked at, was continuously moving one way or the other\ldots 



My wife demanded to be taken to the shopping centre, and since I had promised to her to take her there, I did so\ldots or at least I tried\ldots   After a ten minutes drive the traffic, the exhaust fumes, te noise and everything else got too much for me\ldots (I have to insert here that I used to be a professional driver, being used to drive stoned, I retired on my own free will), i had to disappoint my wife and tell her i couldn't take her to the shopping centre, and instead turned back\ldots   I agreed to stop at a shop where she at least buy a few things she wanted\ldots while she went there, I strolled off into the beautiful nursery next door\ldots looked at the amazing patterns of certain plants\ldots spent a long time in the cactus section\ldots would have bought some if I had the money\ldots especially that one large trichocereus pachanoi\ldots or was it real a pachanoi and not some stray species\ldots I ended up at some coleus looking new sort of ritzi plants which werent really coleus, but something mutated from coleus\ldots I could practically FEEL the dmt present in them\ldots but don't ask me what they are called\ldots anyway I can still find them in that nursery if I want to\ldots 

All the colours and patterns and sheer radiance in that nursery put me back on the right path\ldots 



After we got back home I spent hours walking around in the garden, studying my plants and simply being taken away by them\ldots  I spent hours in another dimension\ldots  It was way more overwhelming than the lsd trip which was actually kind of depressing\ldots  the visuals never stopped even after I got sick of them\ldots Every thing I looked at would move and change, whether I wanted or not\ldots  Visuals much stronger than most lsd trips I remeber\ldots and there have been many\ldots while `inside' I could still contain some sort of logic\ldots and yes, like on lsd I was scared of that small sharp kitchen knife in the sink\ldots the everlasting fear that I could hurt myself with it\ldots .which I had first felt 30 yrs ago on acid\ldots but at the same time I was in control, because the logic inside my head was still working in spite of all this overwhelming spinning outside of my body\ldots  I took 2 temazepams during this trip, and they barely sufficed to calm me down\ldots   I had taken the 5meodipt at 10 am in the morning, and at 10 pm still found it impossible to sleep\ldots finally, with the help of a 3rd temazepam and my last weed I fell asleep at midnight\ldots 



this 5meodipt is some strong substance, visuals way better than lsd,

still less mindfuck than acid and more controllable\ldots 5meodipt absolutely rules\ldots .
