I started the day out at about 12:30, I was in a pretty good mood before the trip and I had nothing to do the whole day. I took 12.5 mgs of 2C-E at about 4:30pm. I had originally planned to stay at my house and lsiten to how this substance reacts to music. ( this is my favorite part of the Psychedelic experience)



Im fairly well versed in pschedelics. Ive done many of the psychedelic phenethylamines, as well as the tryptamines. My favite thus far was LSD, with 5-meo being second. (alpha-O was waaay to stimulating for me.) im 20.

    

It wasn't until probably 5:30, when I started feeling the effects. It first started as an uneasy feeling. I also found it a little nauseating. I never did vomit however, and these feelings soon faded after about 30 minutes. In the middle of a Mark Farina CD, my friend called us and said he was in town. So I told him my current status, and he offered to pick me up. 

    

At about 6:00 I arrived at my friends house, where there were a few other people i knew skateboarding and just messing around. By this time I was tripping fairly hard, there were patterns super-imposed over every thing. my friends face had geometric patterns plastered on his face moving around. Another thing to note was the lack of anxiety or strange/unwanted thoughts. I was not the least bit worried about anything. Every thing was just beautiful and funny. 

     

At about 7:00  it had felt like I had been at my friends house for ages, but it's only been an hour. Nobody there does any psychedelic drugs, so they were facinated by how I acted and what I was seeing. They also thought It was fun to try and confuse me, which was very easy at this point. Again I am just amased at how little stress there is. I'd also like to add that the CEVs surpassed many of the drugs Ive ever tried, and that at a higher dose they would have been better than Acid.

     

I probably started to peak right at about 7:30. Me and my friend were smoking bowls, and catching up for a while then got boared and started shooting random things out of a huge sling being shot at a house that wasnt finished being built.

       

at 9:30 I am already coming down a little and decide to go home becasue he is throwng a big keg party to make money. When I get there my girlfriend calls me and she comes and hangs out with me. Its now abut 10:30, and I am still tripping a little but the visuals are not as pronounced. 



I got to sleep by 2:30.



All in All I thought that 2C-E is a remarkable Psychedelic. I cant wait to try it out at probably 16mgs, I want to see just how much music sounds better. Hanging with people who werent tripping stopped me from listening to some psychedelic music, but I will have another chance to do this wonderful chemical again. I would always start out at the low end of the dose spectrum, 12.5mg was much more intense than I thought, even though I didnt get too much of the anxiety/Schitzo part of the trip, I could see that at a higher dose things could get quite crazy!



Peace and safety, R
