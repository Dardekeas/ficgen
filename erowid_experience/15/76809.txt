I had used MDMA 10-20 times before, and had realized that the effects of the drug were beginning to be milder each time.  After this i stopped taking the drug for the rest of my time in high school.  I also read an entry online that stated that MDMA use is no different if your second time doing it was a week or 10 years after your first use.  After reading this I took a break from taking it until a couple of friends were going to Atlanta Ga for New Years Eve.  I was looking forward to taking `molly' or MDMA powder at the concert for NYE.  It had been more than six months since my last adventure with MDMA, and I was looking forward to seeing if the effects would be the same if not better than my first time use.



I took .2 grams of `molly' that day and not as much as 5 minutes later was feeling the euphoric feeleings.  After this I did not look back.  I had no thoughts of the journal entry I had read online months before, but instead just thought about what a good time I was having at this concert.  My `come down,' as many would call it, was not harsh by any means. I also realized that I had peaked for the entire concert.



This to me was ensuring evidence that my mind is the main factor of my `trip.'  My conclusion to this story is that MDMA has no `loosing the magic' to it, but instead I myself lose the magic.  This is my opinion.
