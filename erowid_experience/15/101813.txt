I'm a 65 year old retired physician who used to trip occasionally on mescaline, mushrooms and LSD.  I ordered some Modafinil on-line to help with sleepiness and attention and was given a bonus package of alleged 3-MeO-PCP.  I have been on venlafaxine (Effexor) 150mg daily for years for moderate depression.

T 4pm Took 400mg modafinil orally.
T + 2hr felt slight head high and increased alertness. Very slight nausea.
T + 3hr reverted to college mindset and took alleged 2mg 3-MeO-PCP rectally by dissolving grayish powder in small amount of warm water and injecting into rectum using ear irrigation bulb.
T + 4 hr moderately rapid onset of very pleasant dissociated state, felt frozen and everything looked sharp and intense and crystalline.  Watched some videos very intensely  and pleasurably.  More intense than I expected, but smooth and not very jittery.
T + 5hr felt like I was coming down a bit, so lay down and closed eyes.  Had about an hour of very pleasurable reverie as if in a warm, black cocoon.  Became convinced that the Beatles and especially the song `I Feel Fine' were the key to the universe!  Was not listening to actual music.  Very positive and enjoyable.
T + 7hr  Gradual coming down.  Unsteady walking - felt zombie-fied a bit.  Had a small bite.
T + 8hr  Went to bed although still feeling alert.  Fell asleep easily.  Somewhat vivid dreams.
T + 16hr  Awoke feeling OK without hangover.

Summary:  I think the modafinil helped keep me alert and positive during the psychedelic experience from the 3-MeO-PCP.  It was a lot of fun with really no negatives.
