I ground 20 grams of kratom leaves in an Oster blender until a fine powder. I then put the powder in the basket of a standard 2 cup expresso pot with 2 cups of water in the bottom, set it on a red hot electric range till the water shot through the substance into the top part of the expresso maker. Then poured off this tea. I refilled the bottom 3 more times and took the total tea, about 7.5 cups and simmered it down to a volume of 2 cups. When hot, this was relatively clear, after cooling it looks like coffee with cream added. After cooling, I drank 1 cup, i.e. 10 grams. 



Within less than 10 minutes, the pain I had been experiencing from a torn shoulder muscle disappeared and my mind became exceedingly clear. I experienced no euphoria, but marked clarity and I was in a space where nothing bothered me. Effects lasted about 8-10 hours with no noticeable side effects. 



Usually when I wake up in the morning, it takes me a while to get going. Drinking 1 cup of this tea before going to bed, I woke up the next morning raring to go with complete mental clarity and none of the usual sluggish feeling. Higher doses prolonged the above mentioned effects, but I noticed no new effects. 



Upon taking 50 grams as one dose, I had the same effects, but vomited about .5 hours after taking the dose and I felt unsteady on my feet.  As a mental clarifier with no undesireable side effects, this is the best substance I have found to date.
