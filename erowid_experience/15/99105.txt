This wasn't my first time trying 25i. I had tried it twice before but it was my first time taking two capsules. I wasn't expecting it to be a bad trip\ldots  I was WRONG!!



One Saturday night I decided to buy two capsules since my parents were going to a concert and three of my friends came over. They were all going to stay sober but me.



I took them at around 9 when my parents left and didn't feel the effects until I was 45 minutes into the trip. Waves of different colors were appearing on my bedroom walls while I was laying on my bed.



One of my friends fell asleep and two others went into the living room to play the PlayStation. I was left alone and by this time I was tripping balls.



I felt my heartbeat racing, I tried controlling it by telling myself that everything was going to be okay, that I was just tripping. But instead of helping it got worse. 



I began feeling anxious, I was clenching my jaw, and my heartbeat began to beat faster and faster.



I got up and walked into the restroom were I splashed water in my face. There is were the worst part began, I was at the peak of the trip. The anxiety grew into another level, I felt as if I was going to have a heart attack. 



Thought like `I am going to die' `I'm going to call 911' ran through my head. It was all happening so fast but it felt as it was never was going to end. 



I began to feel lightheaded\ldots  I had the feeling as if I were going to DIE! My breathing was becoming faint.



Unable to talk to anyone for help I began to tell myself that I needed to calm down. That it was all in my head. So I began to breath in and out. Finally everything calmed down and I went to sit down with my friends in the living room.



I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.
