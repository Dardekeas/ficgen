Okay, just wanted to inform some fellow substance abusers about the effects of clonidine. I'm going to make this short mainly because I'm still feeling the effects pretty severely. I was on vacation at gulf shores and on my way back I had some clonidine I could take, so I took it. I took 1.37(0.1) mg pills, the .07 is because one broke and that fraction was all I could salvage. The effects hit me within 15 minutes and I felt so sleepy, I had pressure on my head and ears, and I felt confused. Needless to say it was not pleasant, it's was a dysphoric perpetual nod that was definitely not enjoyable, not even close to the realm of opiates. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up that one could possibly get a better high by sniffing an asshole. (:
