Hello.  My evil twin(tm) is a green-blind deuteranomal. Due to the presence of an annoying little recessive gene on his X-chromosome, the spectral sensitivity of his middle cones peak at a different wavelength of light 

than a `normal' individual.  Thus, greens look different to him, or not like `green' at all\ldots 



He enjoys both hiking in the wilderness and psychadelics, especially simutaneously.  In the wilderness, it's often useful to be able to spot red objects amidst all the green (e.g. reddish poison oak leaves in the green scrub oak).  He has found that LSD enhances his perception of colors, but does not greatly improve his differential perception of green.  While his hiking companions are constantly pointing out red-tailed hawks, red manzanita bark, or the poison oak he's currently standing in, he still has problems picking them out of a green background.



So when the iodopsin in one or more of the sets of cones is abnormal, the signals being sent to the brain are the same, with or without psychadelics.  How the brain on LSD recognizes these signals may be different, but he 

hasn't found that the green perception improves.



But he's continuing the therapy in hopes of improvement\ldots 



As far as *visuals* are concerned, he hasn't noticed any really special greens that he doesn't see in real life.



But here's a question:  does this hypothetical individual who is colorblind (total achromat, which is rare) \_dream\_ in color?  Would he/she know if the dreams were in `color'? Would he/she know if the hallucinations were in `color'?

`LSD: not a cure, but good therapy for color blindness.'
