Recently, I tried 25 mg of diisopropyltryptamine, DIPT.  It's something I'd wanted to try for quite a while, after reading about it in TIHKAL, but it always seemed mostly like a novelty, so I wasn't in a big hurry to search for some.  A friend had a bunch that he'd gotten about two weeks earlier, and which he and a few others had tried.  He generously gave me about 150 mg of it.



This friend had tried a larger dose, I can't remember exactly how much, but I believe it was 75 mg, though it may have been a bit less.  He'd spent that evening getting thoroughly stoned with a bunch of other people.  Things went well initially, and he was enjoying this mini-party with totally whacked auditory perceptions, but he said that eventually it got very unsettling and disorienting, and he had to leave.  Whether this was the DIPT alone or the DIPT in combination with lots of marijuana was not clear.



So, I decided that 25 mg would be a much more reasonable starting point.  Almost all the DIPT reports that can be found, whether in TIHKAL or online, consistently say that it gives a generally good body feeling, absurd audio effects, and not much else.  So I was not expecting a major trip, or to be psychedelically incapacitated, or to have my mind blown.  I was expecting some kind of twisted entertainment.



After 45-60 minutes, I started to notice changes in the character of sounds.  At this point I couldn't really identify the changes, just that something was different.  Pretty quickly, within the next 15-30 minutes, it became much more obvious that pitches were shifted downwards.  I talked with some people, and their voices were deep and resonant.  There was a comical disconnection between watching someone's face as they spoke and hearing their voice, because it felt like some strange soundtrack had been overdubbed over their usual voices.  Also, sounds that were deeper also seemed a little more full and powerful.



I felt generally good.  There was a bit of a body buzz.  If I'd only been experiencing the pitch shifting, I think it would be very hard to identify DIPT as a psychedelic, but I recognized the body sensations as psychedelic.  But that was about all there was.  At t+1:45 or so, I flipped through the Book of the SubGenius and read for a while, and I had no problem reading the words on the page (i.e. there were no visuals) and I had no problem comprehending the text.  If anything, the Book of the SubGenius made slightly more sense than usual, but maybe that was just because I was reading the section on drugs.



Then I listened to some music.  This was not as much fun as I'd hoped.  The problem was that not only were pitches shifted downwards, they were also out of tune with each other.  Chords did not match.  It was at about the edge of tolerable, so I listened for a while and managed to enjoy it, mostly because I kept hearing new and strange things as the music changed.  One thing which I really noticed is that no matter how much you know and expect things to sound strange, when a new track starts or there's a change in the flow of the music, it all sounds totally bizarre all over again.  You hear a track end, and by that time you're mostly used to hearing things shifted lower, and then there's a three second pause and BAM, the next track starts and it's just too weird for words.



At maybe t+4 or t+5 the DIPT started to wear off.  This was very subtle.  Around this time I'd started smoking some cannabis, and this had only minimal effects on the DIPT.  I went to sleep soon after that with no trouble.  But sounds were still abnormal when I fell asleep.



The next day I woke up and sat down at my computer.  It beeped.  It was not a normal beep\ldots  it was too low.  But everything else sounded fine.  Music, people's voices, etc. were all fine, but whenever I heard a mostly pure tone that I was familiar with, like my computer, or my microwave oven, or my watch, it was still just a little bit off.  By the next day this was gone too.



I've taken 5-MeO-DIPT a few times.  Some of those times, but not all, I have also had audio changes that were very similar to DIPT.  5-MeO-DIPT's audio effects do not seem to be dose-dependent.  They were strong my first time at 10 mg, almost nonexistant at 16 mg or so, somewhat there at 13 mg or so, and then not there at all another time at 10 mg.  The 5-MeO-DIPT caused pitch shifts that were very similar to DIPT, but they were totally harmonious (and therefore more enjoyable) than DIPT.  And when I got those effects, they also lasted through the next day.  This is fascinating to me\ldots  what is that diisopropyl doing inside my brain?  What does it have to do with hearing?  Why does it last 24-36 hours, after all the other effects of the drug are long gone?  Someday we will know.



I do want to try DIPT again, but at a substantially higher dose, just so that I can experience what it's like to have my sense of hearing twisted beyond recognition.  Friends have said that it's one of those things that you need to try once, just so you can see what it's like.  My interest in doing this is totally out of curiosity.  I don't think I'd ever take DIPT for recreation; it just doesn't seem to be a substantial enough package.  But it is worth trying, so that you can see just how funny a psychedelic drug can be.
