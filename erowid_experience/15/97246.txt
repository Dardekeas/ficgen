Background: I've been using herbal insence for majority of this summer. If not smoked several times a day, it's several times every other day or so. so I've been using a lot. This particular strain was `Evilded's mario madness' from Jonny Clearwater. Normally I feel that incense is better than marijuana but after last night I'm scared to try this again. It was the first time I've ever had a bad reaction to this stuff.



Last night right before bed, it was about quarter to 4 am. I finished my game of mah jong and was heading to bed. I had packed a bowl of the insence in my pipe shortly before this. I took one hit 10 minutes before getting up to sleep. I took either two or three hits right before I crawled into bed. I was laying there with my eyes closed, and the first thing I noticed was wrong was that, laying in bed, I had thought 2 of my friends, K and E, were with me. It didn't occur to me until a few moments later that I was alone. I didn't know where I was until I opened my eyes, and even then it took me a minute to remember. 



I felt like I was going to puke so I tried walking to the bathroom but had to lean against a wall just to walk. I only made it to the sink, but I didn't puke, I just had to spit. I was standing in the bathroom when things get *really* weird. So anyway, I was standing at the sink staring at myself in the mirror. As I was standing, my knees started getting weak and my body was shaking. Not trembling, but it was almost as if my body was trying to `hula hoop'. It wasn't huge dramatic moves as if you were actually hula hooping, but I couldn't control my body. No matter how hard I tried to stand still my midsection would just keep hula hooping. 



Then my head felt like it was on fire. I crawled to the living room and tried calling my best friend K. No answer twice in a row. It was 4 am but I had forgotten that part, since I had just left K's house about an hour earlier. I tried calling my friend E (who was also at K's house but left after I did) and he picked up. I told him my heart was racing (I couldn't measure it at the time, but I would guess at least 150-160). I was shaking and crying and to be honest I really felt like I was having a mild seizure. E told me to lay down and to text him in 15 minutes after the incense should wear off. I passed out. I woke up this morning in my bed shortly after noon. My head still feels weird and like Im just swimming in my own thoughts.



Overall smoking these products hasn't been a bad experience. I'm blaming this on the certain strain I had since I'm pretty sure I've never smoked it before. I smoked quite a bit of it earlier (different kind) and wasnt feeling any of the effects (I had a headache later, but that's normal). Although I think I'm going to lay off smoking this for a while, because this experience was scary enough.
