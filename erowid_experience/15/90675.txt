I snorted the first bump of the gram I had gotten at 5:00 pm. I hardly felt it so I figured it was not as potent as other things I had gotten before. I was supposed to get Mephedrone, however my dealer said they ran out and gave me a gram of the MDPV. When I first opened the bag it was strange because it was not very like powder at all, much denser. But I got my scupula and took out enough to do a line, which turned into three because the effects started kicking in very early; I suppose I hadn't eaten that day since noon which might have had a part.



After only 10 minutes I had already started to grind my teeth and had to make a trip to the gas station to get a pack of gum. After about 30 minutes to an hour different effects came in, it felt like I was rolling. This lasted for about two hours, the euphoria feeling that is, then the adverse effects of the drug began. It now felt like I had smoked crack and was coming down, but it didn't end. The restless feelings became irritating because I was tired and wanted to go to sleep. I did not get 10 minutes of sleep that night. It was terribly difficult to focus on anything because my mind would not stop racing, and I couldn't concentrate on anything for more than a minute.  I got terrible twitches every time I would begin to get comfortable. The coke/crack feeling lasted for about 6 hours. Now I have been awake for a couple days, but hallucinations have not started yet.



I have found that nothing will make the feeling go away. I drank a screwdriver to begin with to mellow down my racing heart, I was tired for an hour, and then all effects of the alcohol were gone. I then took 3mg of klonipins as well as many over the counter sleep aids. This did not help either for then I was still wired in my body but my brain wanted to sleep, which lead to a night of tossing and turning in my bed. I feel that if I had taken a lower dose this would not have been so bad, I know now that a little is a lot, and it is much more effective and longer lasting than cocaine. It was worth the experience, now I know to not take as much late in the evening, it seems like a rave or day drug at high quantities. I should have looked at these posts before, 25mg is plenty and I took four times as much, not thinking. But we all learn from mistakes. I hope the next experience is better.
