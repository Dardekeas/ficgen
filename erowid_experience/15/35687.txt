a while ago, a friend had asked me if i wanted to buy some red rock opium, not realizing what it was, i bought about five grammes.  it took about two grammes before i was able to establish an effective system for smoking the material.  at first i tried smoking it alone, and it produced a very mild relaxed state, not very opioid at all.  just a sort of floaty feeling.  what i tried after that was crushing a rock into powder and placing that on top of a bowl of wild dagga flower tops; this worked quite well.  it had a very pleasing taste, and burned for a very long time.  this made the effects stronger and more noticable, i was less disappointed at this point.  but while making you feel somewhat dreamy, it also seemed to make it difficult to sleep.  so really, if i ever bought it again, it would be mainly for the flavour of it, not so much the effects.  so really, what you should do is just buy some dragon's blood incnense; it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper.
