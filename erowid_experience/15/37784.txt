The night started and I had just picked up my presciptions for Klonopins, and Xanax a few hours before.  I hadn't taken any benzos in about a month and a half because of withdrawl symptoms I was getting (back spasms, vomiting, fever, etc\ldots ).  So I decided to take `some' pills tonight\ldots and so the night begins.



(8:00)  I get to my friends apartment, we roll up a blunt and I decided to take a Klonopin and a Xanax to relax.



(8:30)  I now remember why I like benzos so fucking much in the past\ldots feeling of total relaxation.



(8:40)  My other friend arrives and gives me three 2 mg Ativans for a few Klonopins, I then take two (that was my mistake right there).

         

--------At this point it is what I am told happened-------------



(9:15)  At this point I have no idea what is going on\ldots I repeatedly ask the same questions over and over, steal food from my friends kitchen, then tell them to fuck themselves because they have no good food, so I go to the mexican restaurant



(9:45)  I return with food, along with no memory of going to get the food\ldots I then proceed to put the steak quesadia (sp?) in my pocket where I find it 3 days later.



(10:00)  I find some alcohol (or so I am told) and drink a cup of some kind of punch (which doesn't make sence to me because I hate vodka punches and that what was at my friends place).  



(10:15)  I decided that I wanted to go back to my friends house about 20 minutes away, so my friend J (who also had taken pills) somehow lets me drive.



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



(10:45)  We arrive at my other friends house, some people are there and they see that I am completely wasted, and start asking me what I took\ldots I told them some gibberish about Ativan and trailed off.  



(11:10)  Decent size blunt I'm told, but for some reason I threw up all over the place and started mumbling incoherently.  My friends started asking me questions and the only question I answered with real words was `what time is it?' all I said was `morning time'\ldots ..I don't get it either.



(11:15)  I pass the fuck out for and hour and a half until my friend J wants to go home.



(7:30 AM)  Next morning, my mom corners me and asks me what I did the night before, because I am just walking in circles around the house looking for everything.



I was like that for the next 2 days\ldots I do not remember anything from those 3 days.  I've had many pill experiances, hell, I've been prescribed Klonopins, and Xanax for 1 1/2 years\ldots but this was by far my worst.
