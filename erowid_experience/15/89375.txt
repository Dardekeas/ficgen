Once, after ingesting some pack of smart-energy-something I found out that had just consumed about 2,5g of caffeine, some pepper, menthol and other stuff that possibly is not worth knowing about.



I must admit that at this moment of my life I hardly used coffee. I was familliar with it`s mild alerting effect but thats all. Regular cup of coffee is about 60mg, I managed to drink at least 40 cups at once\ldots  The experience was quite unpleasent, mainly\ldots  horrible!



Waiting for tram and later, going home I was looking around me, having difficulity to sit calm. Was very nervous. Then, after leaving tram it began to make me feel sick. My body was like stone, I was sweating much more then ever, felt myself cold and numb. Don`t remember how I managed to get home, but somehow I did. There I had to lay on bed and at least try to calm down. Drinking was difficult, thinking was difficult, moving was totally impossible. For at least 12 hours I tried to fall asleep. Keeping eyes closed was very difficult, when I managed to do so for 5 minutes or so, started do have dellusion of infinite ocean of mercury and it was quite dissociative since I felt then like being in some other dimension. I couldn`t find nothing this surface, being essence of softness and roughess at once.



This dream like state repeated many times this night as I was only able to take short naps for the next few hours, at least 6. I felt sick all the time.



I recovered fully after 1,5day spend in bed. Don`t recomend anyone trying such large amounts of caffeine, its not worth it. 



As far as I remember, main compound of tablets was guarana.
