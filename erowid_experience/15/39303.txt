I've take dxm before like about 17 times but I decided to up the dosage from 300mg to 600mg. Well that was way to much.  It started out like most trips where I sweated a little and had a light stoned feeling.  But while I was watching tv I couldnt keep my eyes open much longer. So I closed them. I could hear the noises in my head and became part of the show. But soon I started having bad dreams about the show (I guess I fell asleep?). 



Anyway it really freaked me out. One second I'd be in my room the next in my bathroom. All I wanted was to get some one on the phone so they could get me off that trip, even though I knew the only way to stop tripping was just to let time pass. So for about 3 hours I rolled around on my floor freaked out and wishing it would all end. So I called my friend tyler he just told me he was going to bed. And I called other friends but they just told me to leave them alone so I just finally went to sleep. When I woke up I was still having a very light trip. I started at midnight and went to about noon
