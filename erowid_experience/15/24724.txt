I suppose it was just plain curiousity that led to this strange combination of drugs.  That and boredom with my usual lineup of drugs (weed, ecstasy, coke, speed, LSD, and shrooms - not all at once of course!).  I was visiting a friend who was a little dry in the cash department and desperate for some weed.  He offered me 5 Zyprexa tablets (10 mg each) if I'd front him a 20 bag until he got paid later in the week.  I figured what the hell since he was a good buddy of mine and I knew he'd pay me anyway.  I wasn't even planning on taking the pills myself.  I had another friend who was a pharmie junkie and I was sure he'd be interested.



But curiousity got the best of me.  I smoked a joint with my buddy, then  suggested we snort the Zyprexa just for fun to see what it did.  He had never taken it before - he has a brother who has manic depression and the doctor put him on different meds so the Zyprexa was `leftovers'.  Anyway we each snorted one pill then smoked another joint.  It wasn't long before I started feeling different.  I looked over at my buddy and he was trying to get up off the couch and having a lot of difficulty.  This was amusing to me, as well as him.  I felt really good, but also really stoned like I had just smoked a LOT of weed.  I also noticed that simple things like walking and talking were a lot harder to do.  Kinda like being really drunk, but not having that `stupid drunk' frame of mind.  It lasted for a good 3-4 hours, then wore off gradually. I didn't notice any usual side effects except I felt sleepy and had cotton mouth which is normal when smoking weed but a little more intense this time. 



I'd have to say that Zyprexa isn't something for the hard core drug users or someone looking for a psychedelic experience such as those with acid or shrooms.  It adds a nice high when smoking weed, and I'll probably do it again.
