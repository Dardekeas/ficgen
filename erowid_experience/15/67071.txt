This summer, after researching it, but with low expectations of effects, I ordered several ounces of Wild Dagga flowers from an online source.



Upon arrival: the flowers have a slight odor, but subtle\ldots like, a really faint mix of earth and lemon.  They look very bright and fresh, and are quite fuzzy and prickly.



3 P.M. 

Subject is a moderately heavy smoker (just under a pack a day), 3-5 time a week cannabis user, and weekend drinker, but fairly physically fit.   Subject had a full stomach, had consumed roughly 100 mg of caffeine about 3 hours before, and had smoked 3 cigarettes since awakening.



I proceeded to take a walk out in the woods (where I always go to try new herbs), and loaded up a clean, fresh pipe with no thc resin in it whatsoever.  I lit it and slowly drew in a heavy lungful.  The smoke is VERY thick, and smells like a bonfire, but for some reason, isn't too incredibly harsh on the throat. I end up smoking the entire bowl fairly quickly, and lighting up a cigarette.



T + 5 minutes- Starting to feel a little lightheaded, the same `head space' cannabis gives me.  AND the euphoria of cannabis. But comparisons end there.  My mind is clear and grounded, and my thoughts are focused.  I feel very content and relaxed, but not `impaired'.  



T + 10 minutes- Walking back to my house,feeling a bit more tired now\ldots much more potent than I had expected (remember, however, I had VERY low expectations\ldots I was expecting an effect like I've gotten from blue and white lotuses, wild lettuce, damiana, kratom, etc\ldots .in other words, no effect at all.)



T+ 15 minutes-effects are gently dissipating, and I'm comfortable and relaxed laying in the hammock, reading in the sun.  



Since this first time, I've come to use Wild Dagga pretty much daily.  I have anxiety problems, and dagga seems to calm my nerves, especially along with valerian root.  The only downsides to this wonderful plant, from what I can see, are 



A: Smoking it is probably not very good for the body, and



B: Even though Wild Dagga tea is good and effective(lasts longer), in my experiences, it takes a significantly larger amound of Wild Dagga to make a tea that is potent enough.  For this reason, I intend on growing and harvesting some of my own plants next season, to cut down on costs (and, of course, to enjoy the fruits of my own labor).
