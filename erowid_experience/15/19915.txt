Having previously used products containing Ephedrine and Guarana, I decided to get some straight Mua Huang and Guarana. I bought a bottle of 250 mg guarana pills, and a bag of Mua Huang 5X foliage from an online vendor.



I made a tea using about two tablespoons (I just kind of poured it in, eyeballing it) and opened three capsules of Guarana into about two cups of water, and brought it to a boil. I poured my self a cup of this, added brown sugar, and drank it. It tasted like coffee with brandy in it (there was no alchohol in this mixture). I drank it all. I had about a cup left that I would drink later. I began to feel the effects in about 20 minutes, my heart beat a little faster, I felt very energetic, etc.. (This was at about 10 PM)



Later (arround 11 PM), I took the rest of the liquid, reheated it, added about a cup of water to it, added brown sugar, and drank this over the period of an hour. I began to feel very good, and extremely hyper. The person I was with could tell that I was very hyper. The effects seemed kind of mild for a while. I got home from my friends house, listened to music for a bit and could still feel the effects.



I lied down for a while, and at about 3:40 AM, I began to peak. My heart began beating very fast, and my ears started ringing, for about one minute. It stopped, then I could hear a roaring noise for about a minute. That stopped. However, there was no way I was going to get any sleep any time soon, so I lifted weights. I had a nice workout session, however my heart was beating rapidly the entire time, never going down. I should also add that the Mua Huang effectively supressed my appetite.



Mua Huang is a very effective upper and appetite supressant, but it is something that really should not be abused, for personal safety reasons. My friends and family are concerned about me becoming addicted to Ephedrine, or overdosing on it.
