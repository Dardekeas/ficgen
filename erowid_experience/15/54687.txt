Quite a few reports on buprenorphine\ldots most of them involve puking. I'm trying to avoid that if possible. Ive never puked from an opiate before and don't want to start now.

Experienced opiate user, but no tolerance\ldots I do random drugs every couple weeks. 30mg oxy or 40mg hydrocodne is the most I'd take in a night. 





Somewhere between 0.4mg-0.6mg suboxone taken sublingually. (An 8mg divided into 4 pieces, one piece divided in half once, and one of those divided in half again.)



0:01 - Watching jeopardy.



0:50 - Slightly dizzy, could be placebo effect or being tired from the soccer. About to take a shower.



1:10 -- Out of the shower and feeling normal. I realized the dizziness was from staring at my computer for too long.



1:40 -- Light buzz kicked in, feels kinda like the start of an oxy high. Bout to head out to blockbuster and publix.



2:00-4:00 -- Light buzz continues, never actually gets me that high.



4:00+ I feel pretty baseline. I'm guessing some must have flaked off when I cut the pill so I ended up taking close to 0.4mg which seems like a pretty small dose. The only problem that I had with my stomach while I was on it was some sharp pains that felt like hunger pangs. This was probably due to the fact that it was around 12am and I had last eaten at about 3pm.



Next time I do it I'll double the dose and see how that works out.
