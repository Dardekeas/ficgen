This is my second try at an experience with sinicuichi. This time the tea had been prepaired with approximately 15-20grams of sinicuichi that had, unlike my previous attempt, been cut to very small pieces. It sat for a little over a day in the sun. This time the brew was an opaque brown color, with a very bitter (disgusting) taste. While I could get down the liquid without difficulties, it was not a pleasent experience.



Some effects were felt almost immediately (t+0:10). A feeling a sedation and a slight laxative effect which went away in 5-10 minutes. The sedation however, persisted. Music sounded phenominal - more resonant and bassy than usual. I put on an awesome song called `Archie Shepp - Blues for Brother George Jackson (Mondo Grosso remix)' and waited for work. I'm really getting caught up in the music, more than usual. I feel cold. I belive that this is because of the sinicuichi rather than the ambient tempiture.



An achy feeling pervades my body, as if I had done a workout the day before, which I had not. I also had this side effect the last time I drank sinicuichi tea, but had put it down to a great deal of walking I had done the previous day. There is also a slight but ignorable nausea. I decide to hit a bowl of salvia at t+1:00, as much out of a desire to rid myself of the nausea as much as to trip (a oft missed fact about salvia is that smoking psychoactive amounts of it *temporarily* banishes nausea). Salvia wow\ldots  I think I smoked more than I intended. My sense of reality was distorted in ways that are impossible to explain.



The soreness is strange - it permeates every muscle in my body but I don't really mind. It's an almost relaxing feeling, more the ache of your body after a satisfying workout than anything else. 



The auditory hallucinations are even stranger. It's nothing like the `distant' sounds I was lead to believe I would hear. Instead, the effects resemble a low dose of DIPT, a substance I have had the pleasure of being entertained by only once. The EQing of sounds is off, bass and lower midrange sounds are accented, giving music a warm bassy feeling. The letter `S' seems to stick out or be overly pronounced - to my ears it gives everyone a slight lisp. Harmonics are frequently changed and emphasised to the point at which one note sounds like 2 or more in tandem. This also gives voices a strange, robotic sound. It does not, however, interfear with my enjoyment of music.



One last note: this substance does not impair my ablity to think or physical coordination in the slightest. I feel quite clearheaded. About recalling memories from the distant past - well that has failed to happen.
