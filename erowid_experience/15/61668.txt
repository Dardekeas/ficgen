My life is a train wreck at the time of experamintation. I'm depressed, lost my girlfriend, and started smoking pot. Not to mention I have AS. Also known as aspergers syndrome. That pretty much means I have sensory integration and have a hard time focusing on boring shit. Basically I'm a genius at topics that interest me but dont give a crap about anything else.



SI (sensory integration) has made my life a living hell ever sense I was born. I have felt like I couldent even live in my own skin. Until just recently its been almost unbarable. Its starting to disperse now. Clothes no longer bother me. Some noises still do though.



Anyways on to my little trip into my mind. The weed ran out so I was looking for another way to get fucked up. Then I heard about diphhydramine. I looked in the medicine cabinate and what do you know I found some sleepinol which has 50 milligrams of it in each pill. I popped about 600 mg worth in that and then I took 2 dryls also just for the hell of it which have 25mg diphhydramine in each. Then I sat back and turned on the tv to watch 24. After about an hour I thought it wasnt going to work so I stood up to get on the computer and the second I stood up I just fell down on the floor. I tried to get up and walk but my balance was to fucked up so I just sat back down. A little later in the trip about 30 minutes later I had to piss real bad so I got up and stumbled over to what I thought was the toilet but the lights were off. I didnt think the lights where off and I thought I was seeing the toilet. I ended up pissing on the floor. The next thing I know im hearing voices narrorating my life. Telling me of the past and the future. I thought this was interesting and wished they would continue but they suddenly stopped. The walls started moving in and out, in and out. I heard a noise sounding like a tornado so I hid in the closet. Then I remembered I'm trippin and I felt really stupid.



About 3 and a half hours into the trip I put on some music but I couldent understand anything everytime they said a word I would forget it. About 4 hours into the trip I started seeing little things crawling on my bathroom floor but I ignored it and decided I've experianced all I was going to experiance and it was time to go to bed. On my way to turn off the lights I fell and it took a while to get up. I finally got up and turned off the lights then stubled over to my bed. The next day I still felt sort of intoxicated almost like an alchohol buzz and I still found walking a little difficult but other than that I was fine. No real hangover thank god.
