It started out as any normal day goes, except on this day I had no pot. I usually toke up about three or four times a day. So with out the pot I was kinda irritable and hostile towards family members. Also when I don't smoke I get semi-physcotic. Semi is the key word. 



As I reached to grab a bag of cookies I found pill bottles. This tickled my dopamine receptors. There was about 5 bottles containg: Wellbutrin, Celexa, Chloroxozone, and the almighty gracious klonopin. Now One freind got arrested for possesion of these so I knew what they did. So I snatched about five of those little orange pills.



I decided to chew up two of them so they stay longer in my system, and snorted three for the kick. The burn of these pills felt so good. They burned but something in them cooled it off. I snorted some water to help the shit go down. This is a very good idea if you ever snort anything.



I sat down, and just BAM! they hit me. It was like the euphoric effects of smoking weed. With a little bit of an alchohol head fog. I decided music would be a good idea. This was a big delema which band would set the perfect mood: Tool, Radiohead, or Led Zeppelin. I decided Zeppelin 3 would be the best. Jammed a little. I was so  suprised how much this stuff worked like weed. I was so happy. Happy memories long forgotten swirled through my brain. The only way to described is an untouched ice cream cone. Right when It swirls out of the machine. I was, cool, calm, remminiscent. Total Bliss from the inside. Be careful You don't get hooked. They seem like they would be very addictive.
