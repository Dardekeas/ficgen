Background:  I am very experienced with both legal and illegal substances.  I have recently been looking for a nice legal herb that would bring me great pleasure.  Salvia divinorum was too intense, blue lotus was mearly placebo, and finally I came across kratom. 



After reading all the reports I could find, I decided to purchase 50 grams of `Super Kratom'  My research showed that 6 grams was the dosage for a strong experience.  I mixed 6 grams of the finely ground powder into a malt shake and drank it.  After waiting for nearly two hours for any feeling to kick in, I gave up and went to sleep.  I decided to try a different method.  I put 7 grams of the powder in the bottom of a 6 oz cup.  I then filled the cup with water.  Next, I mixed the kratom and water together with a fork.  I consumed the entire contents of the cup (without heating or filtering) within one minute.  The taste and texture was bearable.  I filled the glass up with water and drank it again to get the remaining powder from the glass.  After 20 minutes I began to feel frequent waves of euphoria.  I felt slighly warm and very happy.  At 30 minutes I felt like doing nothing but lying down and listening to music.  I felt very content and satisfied.  I felt floaty, spacey, yet focused and able to function normally if needed.  I would compare the feeling to a light dose of DXM mixed with Marijuana.  I was able to relax and enjoy the expeirence for about two hours before I was unable to keep my eyes open any longer.  I had very vivid, pleasant dreams, and awoke with a slight headache.  



Conclusion:  Kratom is a very pleasurable and convenient shaman tool. The effects were highly enjoyable.
