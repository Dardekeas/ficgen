The descriptions online are a little disconcerting, but I saw a friend do it, so I figured I would give it a try.



First try we went really low with the CO2, around 10-15\%. Colours became more vivid, I fealt slightly disorientated. I fealt slightly weird afterwards, so I waited about 2 hours before trying again.



We did a more accurate mix for the 30\% mark, and I began sucking it down. Breathing out through the nose, it had that acidic tang that you get if you smell the top of a recently opened soda. I can understand where people would get the idea of panicing if they just lost it when the breathing became difficult. It does feel funny, because I want to exhale as soon as I get the mix in my lungs. But I remind myself to go with it, there's a lot of O2 there. Colours go vivid, then sort of explode. 



Aftereffects (acquard feelings, difficulty communicating, sense of unreality) last about 5 minutes for the real feelings, and about a half hour for the psychological effects. 



We like thoughtful and tactile experiences, this is neither, I also don't know if I'd do it again\ldots  but it wasn't bad.
