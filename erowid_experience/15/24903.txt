I entered this profound experience very foolishly\ldots  no mental preparation, no precise way to measure the 2c-t-2, after drinking a few glasses of wine\ldots  I had an amazing experience with dpt and alcohol a few days prior, and wanted to experience the same thing with 2c-t-2\ldots  



I ingested the very rough estimate of 20mg at 10pm with a little bread and wine\ldots  the effects hit me within an hour, and by two hours I was tripping VERY hard, a 3+ level\ldots  I went to a club and sat at one of the tables, trying to make sense of my surroundings, watching the colors, profound altered sense of time/movement\ldots  I was relieved that I was experiencing no nausea, but felt unnerved being at this club alone, tripping so hard\ldots  like everyone could tell\ldots  so I walked around for a few hours on the streets, and suddenly I vomited in an alleyway, was sweating profusely, and began feeling like I had poisoned my body\ldots  I called some friends for advice, but could barely communicate\ldots  though it was nice to get reassurance that I was not going to die\ldots 



the peak lasted roughly 4 hours, during which I felt like I was experiencing both insanity and deep spiritual awareness\ldots  the experience would have been fully positive if not for the very negative feeling that I had poisoned my body, unlike the body feelings of other psychedelics I have experienced\ldots 



at one point I wrote in big letters in my journal, `No More Drugs!', I really felt like I was going to die any second\ldots  my pulse must have been extremely high at this point\ldots 



I smoked some Cannabis at roughly 2am (I was back at my apartment), which probably helped with the nausea, though it seemed to increase the hallucinations\ldots  



I jumped from couch to bed, unable to sit still, feeling like my body was going to explode\ldots  took a shower, the water falling on me felt like I was on fire\ldots  bright red\ldots  went outside, smoked cigarettes to calm down\ldots  this lasted until 5am, and after smoking some more cannabis, I was finally able to fall asleep\ldots 



during the trip, when I was not experiencing severe physical discomfort, I found myself approaching level ++++ awareness\ldots but the body load kept bringing me back to anxiety/fear\ldots I am deeply grateful for this descent into both heaven and hell, but I don't think I will work with 2c-t-2 again\ldots due to its very unpleasant physical effects\ldots



a side note: I have been taking Prozac for over a month, and I am not sure how this has effected my psychedelic journey\ldots on dpt and alcohol, I was very relaxed, and had a thoroughly positive experience, which may have been aided by the Prozac, though I'm not sure\ldots  my advice\ldots be VERY careful with 2c-t-2\ldots I learned the hard way\ldots
