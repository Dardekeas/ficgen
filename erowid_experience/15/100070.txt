I'm currently in the midst of that nasty come up. 200mg ingested via a capsule.



At the 1.5 hours mark.



EDIT: Adding Stuff



Now it's 0:48am GMT. Guys and gals: it's just like shrooms. I get that nauseated feeling (every time) and then I'm going to want to spit spit spit\ldots  And then I get that violent retch, for me, always about an hour and a half to two hours afterward. Immediately after that retch, (to steal from another guy's post from some other article) `the buzz finds the groove.'



And now it has. And the nausea fades, and as it does the nystagmus begins. The jaw movement. The tongue lashing. lol

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



2:36 GMT. Bluelight server was busy for the last hour or so\ldots  so I am cutting and pasting from the word processor I was typing all of my thoughts into. Is it strange that I relate the bluelight server's being `busy' for the last hour and a half to `coming up

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



EDIT: Adding Stuff



Now it's 1:02 GMT. Before I forget, I want to point out that through the entire come up, there is this bile that builds in the back of my mouth, near the throat. It must be cleared. Also, I find that I cannot stand light, and even the brightness of the computer monitor before me is quite aggravating.



For whatever reason, I notice a unique body odor after using this chemical. I think it's from my body forcing out toxins (mostly acids). I think I may jump in the shower for a second time. Especially since it marks exactly 2 hours since I swallowed the capsule.



1:44 GMT.



The bath was therapeutic. Warm water. No soap. Gently treat the body's largest organ to a very neutral and relaxing tonic.



Then laying on the bed, face down. Breathing deep. Imagining a gentle massage. Letting everything go. Breathe in. Breathe out. Healthy. Got the crazy tracers going on and the rainbow diffusion off of bright objects.



I have never used DMT, but from the experience reports, this stage of the 6-APB trip I call the `DMT stage.' Visuals are pronounced. Eyes want to close, really, maybe to get away from the visuals? My demeanor is much like our friend Tryptamine Bunny always advises: `let go and simply experience.'



I think that if I were in the massage industry, I would market serotonin \& dopamine massage.



I should note that as of yet, I have hardly noticed any sexual stimulation at all. Bloodflow is amazing right now, too.



1:57 GMT.



So calm a sense of peace. Imagined someone running their fingers gently across the skin on my face, combing through my hair. (OH boy, yellow really stands out right now.)



Satriani's `Echo' is playing, and I can't think of a more beautiful song to exemplify how I am feeling right now. Or maybe it's the song that is making me feel this way?



(The bluelight server is busy all this time, so I've been editing this using a notepad.)



OK now it's time for visualizations on media player to go along with the music.



2:06 GMT.



Now I'm getting sexually stimulated. And right with that notion, I realize that I'm starting to sweat, and that it is hard for me to follow the words that I am currently typing.



2:21 GMT.



Extrasensory on sound, extrasensory on touch. Extrasensory on light, too, as I pointed out earlier. I wonder how taste is affected? I don't feel like eating anything though. My jaw, when in that middle state of being relaxed and tensed, wants to quiver--but now that I am thinking about it, it has stopped completely.



I wonder what my body temp is. Feels like it must be high high high. My thermometer must be broken. Reading 94.1 F at the left ear canal, and the right canal won't read at all.



Interestingly enough, my right eye is dilated to infinitum, my left looks pretty normal. Well it did. Now it's dilated like crazy. 



oh my God. here's what it comes down to: we're all running around, sweating, dancing, reading, testing, resting, fuzzy and sharp, and my urine glows with yellow B-vitamin goodness. and Attention!! there is work to be done!



Edit: Adding More



3:06 GMT.



Music's ended. Silence. No visualizations. Just the sound of the computer's cooling fans whizzing away, and the sound of terrible wind in my ears. I am absolutely spaced out. I'm on the other side, but having passed through, I am changed. Everything imploded then exploded and like a teardrop in reverse.



I was really cold, so I had turned up the thermostat, and turned on the furnace. But, only a few minutes later, and I'm sweating again.



Adding more\ldots .



3:38 GMT. Yeah so it's only been like twenty minutes since I last wrote this stuff, and I'm in a totally different headspace now than I was a minute ago.



OK, here's why:



Ten minutes ago I smoked some marijuana mixed with 5-meo-dalt. It brought me to attention, albeit I'm kind of, at least physically, wonked out. Mentally, I feel sharp. So long as I can keep a connection between my mind and my fingers, then communication will continue. Soon enough, all that remains is the sound of an echo, a decay, that never really ever stops.



3:58:11 GMT. I've been thinking about that, and I swear that I typed that yesterday. OK, this is a fantastic combination. My face is locked in a half-snarl half-smile, but inside I'm as cheerful as a leprechaun in the land of one million rainbows, and to think that I invented all of it. Even you.
