I've decided to write this report because it was my third experience with the substance, so I felt completely comfortable with knowing its effect.



8:00pm - The substance was taking in the bathroom of a music venue. It took 45-60 minutes for the effects to be entirely present, so it's important to be patient. 

I sat on the sideline and awaited its beauty.



I began to think about my surrounding and everybody there. Since I was not with any friends, I started to look into myself and it was comforting. I would have preferred to be with people I knew because this substance makes me want to give love. I just wanted to give everyone around me a hug and tell them I love them. Sadly I felt I couldn't do that because I was around a majority of people who were older than me and I felt it harder to connect. 



10:00pm - I was out of the threshold and during the best songs I would close my eyes and have the most beautiful CEV's. The majority of its visuals were closed eye (which I prefer). The closed eye imagery brought me back to my first trip on LSD. It was so beautiful I was almost started crying because I wanted to share it so badly. I could see how this might be closer to a ++ for more intense trippers but it was perfect for the setting I was in.



12:00am - The show ended and I am still at a definite ++. Once I'm out of the venue I begin to walk around while I wait for a friend to pick me up. As I'm leaning up against a wall watching people pass by, they all start to seem so funny. Everyone their own special character. 



This chemical will made me laugh! (Especially combined with a bit of cannabis) 



12:30am - I get home and lay down to listen to music and enjoy the visuals. 



2:00am - the effects begin to diminish but it takes a while.



4:00am - I finally get to sleep



Woke up the next morning very tired but in good spirits.



My opinion of this chemical is that it should be used as an anti-depressant (At least in to 20-30mg range. 40mg If someone wants a good `roll' type feeling.) It definitely interacts with the heart chakra and for most people I'd assume it to be healing. I was in a bad place the first time I did it and it brought love back into my heart. 



EFFECTS



POSITIVE: Euphoria, internal giddiness, relaxation, empathy, tingly goodness, creativity, vivid CEV's, mild OEV's, adaptability.



NEUTRAL: Mild eye dilation (increases with dosage), mood swings, mild increase in body temperature (nothing to the point of being like MDMA), yawning.



NEGATIVE: Triasmus 



Namaste, 



          Zen
