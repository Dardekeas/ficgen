Unlike the other 99.9\% of people who have experimented with dimenhydrinate, or drama-drama-dramamine, as one other psychonaut so aptly put it, I did not experiment with this substance due to a lack of other mind-altering drugs. My desire to muck around with motion-sickness pills came out of people telling me how much it enhances music, and being a musician this interested me. Also being retarded, I assumed it would enhance my already 1337 muzikal skillz to the point of super 1337ness, or something.



Anyway I'm going to come straight out and say I'm a pothead, and I have had some mild experience with psychadelics and other drugs. Tripped on shrooms many times, and have also run into salvia once or twice.



The first time, I took 12 pills of the straight up regular dramamine, which would be 600 mg for those of you who aren't mathematically inclined. I exprenced no buildup of anticipation or any side-effects prior to the `trip' part of the non-trip. I spent most of the time in front of the computer working on music, as well. About two hours after ingesting said pills, I noticed something was amiss: looking down in my darkened room, my pants seemed to be spiking in small bunches and moving around haphazardly. `This is neato', I thought. I brought my leg up and the hallucinations stopped as soon as it was exposed to the light of my computer monitor. I stuck my hand back into the shadow, and lo-and-behold it appeared to be bubbling. I also heard my neighbors kids calling my name very distantly from outside at random intervals, and I knew this was the drug because I was in my room, at night, with my air conditioning on and I haven't talked to my neighbors in about a year. Being a big fan of childhood nostalgia, I also thought this was neato.



The effects subsided very quickly and I got up and went to sleep on my bed. Incidentally, I noticed no other auditory hallucinations or enhancement of music. When I awoke the next morning, I did some retrospective pondering and decided the `trip' was pretty much pointless, and that I would try it again at a larger dose.



I took 900 mg (or 18 pills) two weeks later. This time, the effects were brought on in an hour. I experienced heavy body load and dizzyness, like being drunk except 100\% less fun and about 75\% annoying as fuck. I experienced very little other than basically feeling like crap. Some pants movement again, but not to the degree as my previous trip. Incidentally, I'm hesitant to use the word `trip' as there was nothing particulary trippy about it. fFor the most part I was confused, disoriented and remember thinking some very odd and unpleasant thoughts.



Four hours after ingestion I found myself laying on my bed, trying to get to sleep due to being ridiculously tired. This was impossible, because every time I tried to keep still in one position I could feel a horribly uncomfortable body buzz building up and taking over me. The only way to alleviate this was to shift position roughly every three seconds. I was reduced to smoking a few bowls to kill the aftereffects before passing out and sleeping for twelve hours. When I awoke the next morning, my memory for the previous night was pretty much non-existant. However, I do remember NOT experiencing realistic delusions as many others have reported, and very little auditory effects even compared with minor effects I had on my previous experience.



Prognosis: Negative. Dimenhydrinate is a stupid, pointless, unfun drug. Any threshold effects were so subtle it couldn't be classified as a trip, and at higher doses the physical effects become so uncomfortable they drowned out the hallucinations in a vat of grease, blood and melted baby fat. The only positive thing I gleaned from the whole experience is that I can share it with other people, and maybe prevent someone else from trying it out.
