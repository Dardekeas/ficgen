I was given a small bottle of GHB and was absolutly thrilled with the effects.  It's a very decadent drug, it makes me want to eat, have sex and sleep.  What's not to love!  After I got through with the bottle I went on a mission to find more of the stuff.  I was extremly successful and bought a small case of 1,4-Butanediol, which is closely related to GHB.



I started by doing it only on weekends and then just on dates or with friends.  Soon, I did it every evening after work to relax.  I started to perfer the way I felt on it then not on it.  I started doing it in the morning before work.  I found that it had a effect similar to exctacy in that it made my feeling more intense.  I cared more about my job and was able to focus better.  I was much more confident.  I started doing it at work and soon I was \_always\_ on it.  



What started happening was this:  I started gaining weight.  I don't know if this is because I was eating more (well yes, obviously) but it also must be because it bulks you up somehow\ldots   it used to be sold for body builders.



And this:  while it used to make me horny, now I couldn't even have an orgasm.  I lost my sex drive.



Besides these very negative and upsetting effects I found when I decided to cut down and not do it 3 times a day, i felt withdrawl symptoms:  shaky, antsy, uneasy, body aches, muscle cramps and inabillity to think about anything else but the damn drug.  I decided that i had gone way too far and needed to kick it completely.  I woke up one morning and gave all my stuff away.  The severe withdrawal only lasted one day, but I was miserable.  My body felt heavy and achey and I felt \_very\_ depressed.  I cried all day, but all in all it didn't last long and I got over it.  



I feel a lot better now although not totally normal.  I am still feeling mighty depressed and the only thing that helps is excersise.  And yes, I got my sex drive back and am loosing weight.



1,4 Butanediol can be a fun drug if only done on special occasions.  But if you want to do it more, I would reccomend *no more than once a week*!
