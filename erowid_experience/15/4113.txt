0
ingested 10x 0.25mg alprazolam tablets orally.

T + 5min
feeling the effects coming up. warm feeling going up from legs. not very strong, but it feels nice.

T + 12min
mild dizzines

T + 20min
quite relaxed now, little problems with thinking

T + 25min
when i turn my head, everything that i see comes a little `late'. also hands feel very heavy

T + 35min
time seems to go very fast. problems with coordination.  little kind of same feeling when in drunk, but this is better and more `clear' state

T + 40min
stoned.. i found myself staring things. it feels  hard to try stand straight. also being `underwater' -feeling is present

T + 50min
no problems understanding things what i heard from tv. i am very relaxed and i feel very heavy and same time i have feeling that i could just jump up and fly

T + 65min
relaxed and little lazy to think anything. feeling that alprazolam is starting to come down.

T + 70min
i walked a little. limbs are still feeling heavy,  but not so much as earlier. also it feeled like i were walking on tiny needles (it doesn't hurt).

T + 80min
relaxation and laziness that slides slowly away. to 200min.



well.. it was nice experience with such a low dose. there were just a little euphoria and no ego loss at all, next time i'm going to try it with 7.5mg dose.



happy exploring!
