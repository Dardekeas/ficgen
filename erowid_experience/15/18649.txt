Just last week I decided to try ecstasy.  It wasn't a hard decision, but it still took me a couple of minutes to overcome the butterflies before swallowing that little E pill.  I of course, have done other `drugs' prior\ldots (marijuana, cocaine, various perscription pills)\ldots and I was just looking for that `better' high.  I started to feel the effects in 30 minutes, after I finished a glass of orange juice. (A friend had told me that Vitimin C helps with your trip.) My head felt wierd, but at the same time I just relaxed and let the drug overcome me.  The peak hit quickly and in no time I was rolling. I loved the feeling. About 10 minutes in to the peak, my friends and I decided to smoke some pot.  I took about 8 to 10 hits total off my bong, and I was really feeling high. We just sat there talking with each other, self-obsorbed and interested in everthing that was said.  I



 noticed that as the E was wearing off (3 hours later), I slowly grew pissed off, wanting to feel the full peak again.  So, I chewed up half of another ecstasy pill. (It was all that was left, I would have taken a whole one if I could've.) My high got better, but I didn't peak again. I drove just fine that night (with the music really high - ditto on the bass), and when I got back home, my girlfriend and I decided to have sex. It was okay, I've always heard sex on E is the best, but I could not really tell. My orgasm wasn't better either, in fact the feeling was delayed by a couple of seconds.  Then, after all was said and done, I took her home and returned back.  When I climbed into bed I felt the effects barely, and only while laying down. I tossed and turned the whole night, not able to get any peaceful sleep. In the morning, I took two 20mg pills of prozac and went to school. I felt fine the whole day and to this day I don't regret taking it.  The crash wasn't all that bad since I was high on pot and the restless sleep wasn't nothing compared to the really great high that little E pill gave me\ldots and there was no hangover thanks to the prozac!
