Bupe is a complex drug.  My sister is officially on it for `pain,' but she's really taking it because of a 20 plus year addiction to opiates.  She found a doc willing to keep her high and happy.  Many people use it as an aid to stop opiates.  She started on a dose of 2mg a day.  She's now taking 16 mg a day, so I'd say that it's not all that great (for her at least) as a methadone substitute.  Now, I have my own reasons for taking it, and for me it's just about perfect.



Since I have access to Bupe (thanks sis!) I've taken it about a dozen times.  I started out by taking a 2mg pill.  I stayed up all night and felt like a million bucks.  Took it a few more times after that.  The most I've taken in one day was 8mg.  I was loaded for 18 hours and threw up twice, but it was still a great experience.  



I suffer from chronic depression, and I have extreme episodes where I'm suicidal, almost catatonic, the whole bit.  The docs usually put me on a couple of anti-depressants (which I'm still taking every day)  and some benzos (Ativan, Xanax, etc I take them about 2x a week).  This works well, but it takes some time to kick in if they've switched your meds, or if you were stupid enough to get off of them and then fell into depression because of it.  If you've ever had a depressive episode, you know that what you really want is some relief.  Instant relief.  Bupe fits the bill quite nicely.



Since I've taken it a few times, and have had good luck with other opiates, I now take 4mg when I take it.  I've tried Vicodin, Percocet, Codine, etc. etc. and the buzz of Bupe is much like those, but it lasts way longer.  I have a few orange 8 mg pills, with a cross on one side and `N8' on the other.  I split the pill in half and pop it under my tongue so it dissolves.  Yes, it tastes pretty damn awful, but so what?



After about an hour or so, my whole perspective on everything changes.  I love everyone, and I'm not afraid to say it to their faces.  I feel very forgiving, and very positive about my life and everything else I think of.  I'm not saying Bupe makes me the life of the party.  My speech is obviously slurred, and I nod out from time to time, but it's nearly impossible for me to be negative about anything once I'm on it.  



I have tried to live out a normal day after taking bupe (4mg lasts about 8 hours or more).  I can do my laundry, even balance my checkbook, though that took a lot longer than usual.  I would highly recommend that you DON'T DRIVE on bupe.  You might think you can, but let me tell you, nodding out behind the wheel is NOT a good idea.  Taking a walk outside also may seem like a great thing to do, but you may not be able to walk very well, or very far.  I often forget just how loaded I truly am on bupe.



One other interesting thing I've found out about Bupe is that it doesn't mix well with cigarettes.  If I smoke a cig while on bupe (I'm trying to quit, and don't smoke much) I will immediately go into a `nod'.  There's also a pretty good chance that I'll puke.  My limbs feel heavy, sometimes I get double vision.  All this stuff would be fine if it didn't include SERIOUS nausea.  After I smoke, I almost always visit the porcelain altar, if only to spit out all the drool that has filled my mouth (lovely visual, huh?)  So, smoking a cig can bring the full bupe feeling right back, but you might lose your lunch, so beware.



I have said to one of my psychiatrists that I was sure any opiate would be a great drug to take during a severe/ extreme depression.  I've had 3 full blown ones, and am sure to have more.  When I told my doc this idea, he laughed and blew it off.  Well, I did some research and apparently in Europe, some docs use opiates sparingly for depression.  One time, I downed 1/3 of a bottle of liquid Codine during my last and worst episode.  It freed me from my misery for four hours.  I took that time to pay all my bills for the next 3 months.  THen it came back once the Codine wore off.  



Bupe is great because it lasts for so long.  I've never shot up heroin, never tried any form of it so I don't know how it compares to it, but it didn't seem to do much for my opiate addicted sis, except that it got her even more addicted, so beware if you have a drug problem.  



I'm going to try bupe during my next depression, which I'm due for any day (get it every 2-3 years it seems).  Hopefully I'll have good news to report.  As it is, using opiates for depression is totally unthinkable to American psychiatrists, at least as far as I know.  If you're looking to take this drug for fun, be very careful and read the other posts.  You don't want to spend your day/night spewing vomit because you took too much.  I took four mg about 3 hours ago, and look, I'm typing this just fine, but I know I'm loaded.  I nodded out twice during this.  So, Bupe is a useful drug, just don't take it often (the euphoria only comes on if you do it once in a great while) and don't take too much.  Good luck, folks.
