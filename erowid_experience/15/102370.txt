Writing this starting at T+11:30. It's just after 1:00AM.

I am a 20 year old male, 140lbs. Avid pot smoker, done MDMA, MDA, methylone, 2C-B, LSD, 25i, Psilocybin, DXM, salvia, nitrous, cocaine, Adderall\ldotsI think that about covers it haha. With the exception of the occasional MDMA, LSD a couple handful of times, and the Adderall I take most days only have limited experience with the drugs listed. This is my first mostly solo trip.



I received the AL-LAD from a trusted internet vendor and was very excited to try it out, being in a sort of slump in my life where I'm not using my winter break productively and being a lazy fuck sleeping in and smoking weed instead of looking for summer internships, and I felt I could use a psychedelic ``reset''.



T 0:00

1:30PM. Woke up about an hour and a half earlier (winter break yeahh), staying at my college house with good friends that are accepting of psychedelics, some of which had dabbled before. For the most part though, I would be spending the trip solo, this being my first time doing so. These tabs are big, thick, cream colored and say AL-LAD on one side. They're supposed to be 150ug, and the general internet consensus is that seems to be a rather good starting dose to go for. I stare one down, wondering what it'll bring me, and then I place it down on my tongue and go about random business. I intentionally don't take Adderall today.



T + 0:20

No taste, which is always a good sign. I can't trust local ``acid'' that runs through my school because it all seems to be 25i, which you know right away from that bitter, numbing taste. This tastes like paper. First alerts perhaps? I smoke a bowl.



T + 0:40

Definitely feeling something. Got those leg jigglies. That electricity that runs up and down your legs. Smoke another bowl, do a dab. Chew up and swallow the tab. Dabs and tabs :). This is some really good wax, too. Looking outside it's not a horrible day for January, maybe I'll take a walk in a bit.



T + 1:00-1:30

More dabs. Ramping up on the comeup. This stuff seems just like LSD thus far. Less jittery though. Decide to take that walk. Gather my shit, try to leave the house like 3-4 times all while forgetting things, functioning normally is starting to get mildly tricky. Finally walk outside at 3PM listening to a Pandora station of psychedelic dubstep such as Minnesota, Pretty Lights, Phutureprimitive, and Seven Lions. Dubstep, especially this sort, and acid's a great combination. You got this massive, immersive soundscape, and so many varied sonic textures. It's like candy to my ears for my brain to play with, puts a sweet taste in my mouth. Definitely tripping. Mild visuals. Go off into a wooded path near my house that takes me behind some dorms.



T  + 1:30-2:00

I'm calm despite the psychedelic takeoff. Visuals are starting to become more apparent. Nature is starting to breathe around me, colors are rippling through all hues. Full-out shit-eating grin on the face. My mental state is definitely psychedelic, but I'm calm and there isn't too much mindfuckery going on. Thoughts spiral around in electric fractal curlicues. If only the people passing me on the trails could see what I see now. I wonder if they know? Most of them will never know what psychedelics do to the mind, but I embrace that people view life through different lenses and that's an ok and beautiful thing. I was going to go out to a nice wooded clearing a longer walk away and smoke more but I'm coming up kinda fast, I'm on an unknown chemical, and suddenly I have the very strong urge to be inside and sit down. I turn around and walk back. Stunning visuals. This feels like real acid, as opposed to the sketchy-feeling 25i, but there's definitely differences. If this was acid I'd be gung-ho, if not anxious about continuing to walk and move towards a destination, but rather I want to sit on this stuff. Could also be I'm high on bud. Dunno. Keep walking. Get to my house.



T + 2:00

Hey roomie, I'm alive. How the fuck long was that? A half hour? Wow. Sit down on the couch. Not feeling as comfortable as I could be, this stuff definitely does have some of acid's energetic bodyload, although not as much of it. Take a bongrip. Exhale. Everything in the room starts wiggling, hard. I stop my housemate mid-sentence and decide I need to go up to my room and listen to some music.



I just got a new guitar amp. Thing's a hybrid, so it's got an oldschool vacuum tube that feeds into a modern chip-based situation with effects, and the end result is this thing makes my guitar sound amazing. I plug in. Fumbling around with wires is difficult. I futz around on my computer and manage to pull up a 1978 Grateful Dead show.



Oh man I'm pretty high on this stuff, I hope I can play. Visuals everywhere. I feel mildly anxious but I'm good. Throw on Eyes of the World. Start playing along. This is the first time I've got a chance to sit down with my electric guitar by myself while tripping. Playing my acoustic has always been an amazing experience, but this was something else. I can play this song pretty well, so the fact that I'm kinda frying doesn't seem to stop me. I got my tone matching Jerry's pretty well, this amp sounds FANTASTIC. I love musical improvisation, it brings me transcendence in any state of mind, but my creativity has definitely grown from my usage of mind-opening drugs. Jamming out on my electric alone in my room while on this marvelous chemical makes it something else though. My fingers dance an improvised dance around a rainbow, flowing fretboard. My mind takes ideas out from the Grand Consciousness and relays them to my muscles, my fingertips make love to the strings. My guitar picks up my dance and sends a flowing signal over to the amp, overdriving it into a warm yet sparkling brilliance that I make fizzle and blossom into kaleidoscopic, psychedelic bliss. Oh man, this is AMAZING. A peak life experience right here. Grateful Dead is made for acid, it helps me navigate the psychedelic space so well. I'm tripping kinda hard but my guitar is keeping me grounded to something. It's an extension of myself. I am one with the music. I play Wharf Rat into Franklin's Tower next. Tripping hard at this beautiful Dead poster I have, I can't believe what my mind is turning this static image into. Breathtaking visions unfold from the poster while I spin golden electric sonic silk out through my instrument. Fuck yea.



Oh also I'm smoking weed and doing dabs like a chimney. I can't even feel it at this point, but weed always does unilaterally good things to my trips.



AL-LAD seems to have a much more warm-and-fuzzy vibe to it than LSD, which at times can seem somewhat cold and vaguely cynical. It's softer. All good things in my book. Play along with a couple more songs off the show.



T + 3:00-3:30?

Down to a level where I can function around my roommates and am not flying so high in psychedelic space that I need to play my guitar to give me some sort of grounding for the trip. I go downstairs, chill with roomates, smoke more, and trip out at the tapestries on the walls. Talking's kinda difficult.



T + 5:00-7:00

Oh shit mad heads are showing up to watch the new Adventure Time! Solid crowd of goodvibesy people, awesome way to spend my comedown. Still lightly tripping as the new episode comes on, everyone gets quiet save the passing around of bowls and I get immersed into the cartoon. This one's a particularly trippy episode about a cursed grass sword that gets attached to Finn's hand, and at the end of the episode he realizes that having a retractable sword attached to his person at all times isn't so much of a curse to him, and embraces it. Resonated with my views on general happiness, to look at your situation from a positive perspective as much as possible.

I continue to slowly come down, hitting about baseline at T + 9:00. Still feeling the afterglow. On a random note, I had seen someone online categorize this substance as having a sort of ``pink'' character to it. I'm not sure why but I can agree with that.

Let's see what this psychedelic reset does for me. I didn't really address the issues I was hoping to address directly, but I feel refreshed mentally!



TL;DR: This is my new favorite chemical. In addition to being more calm, warm, and nurturing than LSD, it is on a much more reasonable time frame. Unless I'm at a festival, the 12 hour LSD trip is often just way too long and by like, 6-8 hours in I'm ready to be done but still tripping hard. On this stuff I was close to baseline by that point. This is everything I could possibly want a psychedelic to be. Absolutely beautiful stuff, and I am so grateful to be living at a time where this magnificent chemical is available for use.
