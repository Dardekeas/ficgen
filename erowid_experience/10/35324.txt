I have a medical treatment: 0.4 mg X 4= 0.16 mg (near to the classical dose of  2 mg) of Subutex (buprenorphine) per day.



I noticed that Salvia divinorum doesn't work as usual, even with good extracts (X5 from a good store). Just this feeling of salvia gravity, bouncy effects, sweating and nothing else, except being tired.  I noticed the same thing  with codeine\ldots but a little bit less. I wonder if it's because of the gaba \& kappa receptors.



So, the first time I took Salvia, I was not on Subutex at all; I smoked just some dried leaves in a water pipe, and I felt  a change in my mind and body. Bouncy effects, laughing a lot, irrationnal thoughts\ldots and sweat!  



The second time,it was an extract 5X and I've been a bit scared! I just took a hit in my korean pipe and I lost my body! I was in a very old country house in britanny, and I was near the cheminey. And,I became the cheminey!!! out of body experience. My girl friend, who is a doctor, laughed at me! I could'nt move at all and I was really impressed; But, I was nervous: I told her:'You can't imagine what's happened\ldots ..Ha,I lost my body!!!'.



Again,with extract, I tripped really hard: I became an animal! and i realized my dreams were coming true. After, I used normal dried leaves, and it was really intense, but a bit less hard; Sounds and musics were really intense, the furnitures of my appartement were shining\ldots .etc\ldots 



I have a good experience of  a salvia trip (I made myself an elixir, but it was too strong: nothing happened and suddenly\ldots .wow!I was on my bed, thinking I was in a little village in Spain at the dawn! (I was in Paris,hum\ldots ).



Since I'm on subutex, it's quite different. The trip doesn't really start\ldots .and the few effects are vey short. I want to stop this horrible subutex, if my doctor is okay, and back to my very philosophical diviner's sage!



--------------------

Aug 24 2004 update:





I stopped Subutex and I noticed S.D was much more active. The only problem with this horrible Subutex, it's quite hard to stop using it. So,I had to get back on it, `cause I was not very well. Anxiety, panic and bad sleep\ldots .



I was only addicted to codeine, so I don't think it's a good way to get out of this stuff with Subutex. I guess, it's a good product for people who are on heroin.



So,if you want to slow down on Subutex, please, do it very, very slowly!
