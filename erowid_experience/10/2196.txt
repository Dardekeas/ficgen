2C-T-2 has been sold in the Dutch smartshops from November 1997 until now without any problems known to me. Experiences are very similar. 



First some tips: 

-Take your total amount at once. Double dosing does not work. 

-Drink a lot. This tweeto gives dehydration. Food is good too. 

-Dosage under 16 mg will give a subtle +1, dosage over 18 will really bring the fireworks.



(with 8 mg) Setting: A eighteenth century mansion. Rooms of oak, large mirrors and five good friends. After two hours I feel like a intense psychedelic is knocking on my door, but he never comes in. It touches the surface. Dept and colour are different. The humorous substance does not allow me to stop laughing. This ceiling seems miles away, letting me drift into deep spaces, but as soon as I forget to focus, I am back to baseline. I wonder whether to smoke some grass or drink some alcohol as I know that a lot of people go out on it in combi with alcohol. Because we would like to go more into the psychedelic realm we choose the joint. Wrong answer!!! Now we are just veeeerrrry stoned and all the psychedelic effects are gone. We went to bed. I woke up with a head ache and stayed in bed for five more hours. Then my friends told me they had the same problem, but solved it with food. They turned out to be my saviours. I felt extremely great the days afterwards.



(with 20 mg) Setting: very small houseparty Within 15 minutes I feel something strong bouncing in and away again. This one did not land on my head until 1:50 after swallowing two and a half white pills. Then it landed hard. Some pressure on my head for half an hour. Sitting was better. I wondered where this would go and started to smile. The smile transformed into a laugh until my belly hurt. Then I was energy. The walls danced with me. So was anything else. Music was good to me and I was good to the turntables. Talking was nice but I had no interest in the sensual efforts of a woman. The experience lasted 7 hours in total. No after effects.



This is a very controllable substance which gives the visuals without losing yourself in the experience. [erowid note: this seems to be true at low dosages for most people, other users have reported strong dissociation, memory loss, confusion, delerium, etc at higher dosages or much different sensitivities.]
