I was diagnosed with having Panic Disorder in seventh grade and have been on variety of medications since, and still have not found the right med/combination of meds. First of all I'd like to say that I don't recommend using Klonopin daily for more than a week because it is very addicting and withdrawal is not pretty. In fact, it mimics alcohol withdrawal and it's possible to have a seizure, so don't get hooked. 



I've been looking for a `cure' for my Panic Disorder for years, realized that there is no magical medicinal `cure', and am searching for a medication/herb to tame it; keep it under control. When I was off medication for a two-month period, I took some pseudoephedrine for a stuffy nose. My nose is always stuffed up due to allergies. I assumed it would be speedy (as it is related to ephedra) and I was right. I liked it for a while, but any stimulants make me get heart palpitations and a lot of the time Panic Attacks. So I ran to my Klonopin and took a 1mg tablet. I suggest using a 0.5mg tablet of Klonopin if you do this because 1mg may very well knock you on your ass, as it is equivalent to a full 10mg of Valium on a benzodiazepine equivalency chart. 



The Klonopin kicked in after about 20 minutes, and I started to feel absolutely wonderful. I was not euphoric or `high', but relaxed with energy. And NOT nervous energy. It was very nice. Downers and uppers seem to work very well together. Of course I can't say that for all mixtures of downers and uppers, but this specific combination was excellent, and put me in the perfect mood and state of mind. I did this for about a week until I ran out of pseudoephedrine, and didn't get more because I decided to try yet ANOTHER prescription medication. *sigh* Hope it works.
