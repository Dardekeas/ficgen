I have been an opiate user for at least 2 years - and my tolerance is quite high. Having read about the potential benefits of kratom, I decided to try some. My first experience which was recorded tonight was a good one, however, my next dosage will be more. =) My husband said there's no time like the present, however, as much as I would like to ride the bus again, I don't know exactly how long it will take for my system to be clean, so I shall re-dose tomorrow morning.



6:45- Measured out about 2 teaspoons of the `super kratom' powder (3 grams) from a reputable Shamanistic online source. Mixed up the herbal powder with about ½ C Spicy Cider from Trader Joe's. Excellent masking ability - the taste was slightly herbal, not unpleasant - but the texture was still like drinking thick pesto sauce. Starting mindset, hopeful, happy, talking to a good friend on the phone, who just makes me grin. Withdrawing slightly from hydrocodone (last taken 7 hours and 45 minutes beforehand), clammy hands, and a slight sweat are manifesting. 



7:04- Slight warming on the back of my head, feeling good, hoping for stronger effects. Understand the desire to take more, however, I am withholding. 



7:11- Heart rate, normal, pondering a cigarette, however, since I took the powder on an empty stomach, have no desire to encourage nausea. The sweat of withdrawal seems to be lessening.



7:15- Perception definitely slightly altered. Vague fogging or `shimmering' effect around edges of my vision. I definitely feel as though I am altered, however, can't compare it to any one thing\ldots..most like a combination of MDMA/oxycontin if one were to combine them - but without the joyous feeling - just happy mellowness\ldots and it's not as strong. I definitely feel the need to be productive. I ask my husband to drive me to the store, and he does. The store seemed more enjoyable than usual, however, according to him, I was only behaving slightly `more goofy than usual'. 



7:51- Feeling slightly high, my heart feels as though it's beating faster, however, when I time it, it is not. My opiate withdrawal symptoms are nearly gone! I'm considering a second, small dose.  The pain in my side is gone! (I have a chronic pain condition for which I take hydrocodone) Nice!



8:07- Feeling the stimulant effects, but want the opiate-like ones, so I have decided to take an extra 1 tsp. And 5 mg valium.  This will make for a total of 3 teaspoons, and total 4 ½ grams of kratom `super' grade. I decided to make a tea out of this one, so nuked about ¼ C water in the microwave, soaked the teaspoon of kratom in it for a few minutes, then mixed in some apple juice and sugar. =) Now I wait.



8:13- I have no withdrawal effects at all from the opiates now\ldots..this is a very promising thing! Yeah! One thing I was not anticipating was being hungry. I feel starving but am afraid that if I eat anything I will throw up, as I have read other reports of people experiencing stomach problems. This seems to be a very mental drug - think happy thoughts, and all is good. =) Then, isn't everything like that?



8:18, I read that the `speedy' effects last for about 90 minutes\ldots.good - then they should be over soon and I can get on with the good stuff. I am currently munching slowly on jelly beans as I still want to see where I go on an empty stomach\ldots but just can't contain myself. I hope the little batch of sugar doesn't come back to bite me. I know I always read these reports and say, `Oh God, no, you didn't just do \_\_\_\_\_\_ (take a double dose after 10 minutes, drink liquor to calm an upset stomach, etc.). Lets hope my jellybeans don't fall under that category. 



8:22- Feeling slightly warm and sweaty\ldots then, that could just be the withdrawal symptoms coming back. 



8:27- When I'm coming up on MDMA, I feel hot yet cold at the same time, and vaguely sweaty. I'm experiencing the exact same feeling now, but with a calmer edge to it. I think I'll go inside and read a book. 



8:29- My heart rate is slightly increased. =) Time to lay down and enjoy the upping. 



8:44 (I had my husband write this for me from the other room) Eye lids heavy but still mentally alert, I'd like to sleep, yet dont. It feels good to lie down.



8:55- Feeling much more mellow. My heart seems to speed up and slow down occasionally, but nothing that a cup of coffee wouldn't do. I really want to lie down and listen to some music\ldots..but first, some food =).



10:45- Felt very sleepy, so turned off the light and listened to some music. The experience was definitely enhanced. I fell asleep.



11:20- I have since woken up. I would have liked some stronger effects as far as the `calming' effects went, however, it's always important to try something slowly, IMOHO, than hop in the deep end. One really good thing about the kratom was the pain relief I experienced, and the fact that I felt NO need to take hydrocodone- something I normally take 40-50mg of, 4 or 5 times a day- and for the first time in a long time, I missed a dose and felt fine! I've actually only taken 30mg now and feel fine. I believe I'll be doing this again\ldots .alot - experimenting with doses and helping myself taper from the opiates. I have noticed slight irritablity on coming down, so have taken 2 5-HTP as well as 10 mg of valium for sleeping purposes. A final note: the jelly beans, and subsequent chips and salsa and pasta stayed down just fine! 



Happy trips, everyone!
