I am a healthy 24-year-old male, and started exploring psychedelics about a year ago. The following account describes my first experience with 2C-T-2, which took place two days ago. This account was reconstructed using a combination of a log from a chat room, a few notes on paper, and memory. I measured my blood pressure and temperature several times during the experiment. I had been taking a break from psychedelic experiments for a few months due to a bad AMT experience. In fact, I believe I may have had some subconscious guilt because I had promised myself and others that I would not use any drugs for at least a year. 



6:23 pm: Vitals: blood pressure 118/82, pulse 74, temperature 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)



6:56 pm: Swallowed a gelcap containing 10mg 2C-T-2



7:41 pm: First feelings of something out of the ordinary



8:08 pm: Feeling `fuzzy' and getting chills. I see ripples moving across the carpet. Temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)



8:15 pm: I begin shivering, which comes and goes throughout the experience. `I'm starting to notice patterns in the carpet now, lights seem to persist longer after closing my eyes than I would expect. A bit of an ache in the back of my head, but not too bad.'



8:23 pm: Listening to some music, I notice underlying melodies that I had not noticed before. `Distances seem to be greater than usual.'



8:27 pm: `I'm seeing distortions in the ceiling, like it's bunching together.'



8:33 pm: `I'm seeing rainbows in my peripheral vision' Temperature: 99.0 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)



8:45 pm (approximate): I am startled when music I am listening to suddenly seems to start skipping. In fact, it had simply reached a repetitious part of the melody. The volume of the music seems to suddenly increase and decrease.  At times I seem to hear it crystal clear, at other times it sounds as though it's coming from inside a cave.



8:47 pm: `Now I'm starting to remember how this feels and why I liked it'



8:48 pm: `I was talking about a higher dose experiment tomorrow, but now I'm not sure I will. [\ldots ] I dunno, it just occurs to me that I'm poisoning myself. I guess I should just respect my body more.'



8:50 pm: Blood pressure: 136/88 pulse: 100



9:11 pm: `I'm seeing some faint rainbows if I close my eyes for a while'



9:19 pm: Window Media Player, the program I'm using to listen to music on my computer, generates some animated abstract graphics when playing music. If I close my eyes while watching these graphics, I can faintly see them continue.



9:28 pm: Blood pressure: 145/104 Pulse: 103



9:41 pm: `Very jittery again'



9:50 pm: Blood pressure: 144/100 Pulse: 110



9:56 pm: I feel achy. `It seems like most of the good feelings didn't stay.'



10:01 pm: `I feel like I've isolated myself so much.'



10:10 pm: Blood pressure: 134/97 Pulse: 112



10:15 pm: `I've gone through almost a liter of Gatorade. I'm pretty thirsty.' I had also had about 600 mL of water.



10:21 pm: `I had romantic notions of being a psychonaut, doesn't seem to be so romantic at this point.'



10:22 pm: `I'm seeing little green lights in the carpet. I can still see the lights if I move my head away, but when facing the carpet, they snap to certain regular points in the pattern.'



10:29 pm: Temperature: 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)



10:34 pm: Blood pressure: 141/103 Pulse: 106



10:44 pm: `Problems with motor control are frustrating me.'



10:45 pm (approximate): Turned on the television and started watching a satirical news program. I find it very funny, and wish I had been watching it from the beginning. The sound sometimes seems to echo. At the time I wondered if I was noticing an artifact of my television's cheap speakers.



11:09 pm: `My jitters seem to be gone.' Blood pressure: 139/97 Pulse: 97



11:35 pm: Blood pressure: 128/97 Pulse: 92



11:38 pm: `I'm coming down.'



12:08 am: Blood pressure: 129/88 Pulse: 97



12:56 am: Blood pressure: 128/90 Pulse: 86



1:20 am: Went to bed. I had no problems sleeping.



I did not find this experiment to be particularly rewarding, but maybe with a better set and setting, the benefits might have outweighed the unpleasant side effects. I might try another experiment with this chemical, but not any time soon.
