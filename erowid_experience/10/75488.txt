I got a free $\sim$12mg sample of this new chemical which the supplier was giving out to encourage the submission of reports, as there is next to nothing known about it. So the day I got it I shared it with two friends. One of them and I smoked cannabis the day before, he is a frequent smoker whereas I smoke extremely infrequently as I don't enjoy it all that much. It's good before eating a big meal, at a sit-down concert, before sex, and to get to sleep but that's about it for me. I tend to smoke more than I should and get palpitations, anxiety, annoying hallucinations, way too tired, and unbearably aroused. So I figured I'd try this cause hey it's free and maybe I'll enjoy it more.



The substance was a dense, flat mass of crystals, a pretty rich red-brown in color. It stuck to the razor as I scraped it out of the bag and was hard to get in the pipe. It smelled just like DMT but its texture was totally different. I put it in my baby pipe with a screen in it and held a flame close to it but not touching, letting it vaporize. It tasted fine, a bit chemically, better than weed to me. I breathed out a very small amount of smoke and passed it to my friend, telling him how to hold the flame. We smoked it until we breathed clear as the JWH-018 melted and was invisible so we weren't sure when it was gone until we did not exhale smoke or taste it.



I felt energized, it didn't feel like cannabis at all to me. I didn't want to run a mile or anything but I wasn't tired instantly. I was aware but not too aware, definitely not `stoned' feeling which is great to me. My friend also said he felt really energetic. We went to the store and got junk food, which was delicious. I didn't feel the need to binge but taste was really nice. I didn't feel anxious at all and had no psychedelic effects, like I get with weed.



The effects were subtle and if I did it again, I would smoke more. My friend inquired about buying some so I take that as a good sign. I am also thinking about purchasing some when I get some spare cash because it was similar to my first cannabis high ever, which was energetic though pretty psychedelic. I'm not sure when it wore off as I went to bed about two hours after I smoked, just cause it had been a long day. Sleep was fine.



If you really like weed stay with weed, but if it gives you some bad effects maybe try this out as an alternative. I'm glad I did!
