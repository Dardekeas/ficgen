I've been using catnip for a long, long time now.  It's a good cheap smoking mixture and a great substrate for herb powders and freebases.  I'd have to say it's one of my favorite herbs to play with.  I don't smoke pot at all.  From what I've heard from other people who do use pot, catnip is like a lighter version of it.



I started off smoking it alone, first in a joint and then in a pipe.  The joint is more fun, but with the pipe I use less.  Usually I will use about a quarter gram.  Leaves or buds can used, but I think the buds are better.  The effects are immediate and are felt as a mild relaxation and sedation, comparable to the gentle post-orgasmic euphoria.  It calms my mind and makes meditation alot easier, and boosts creativity to boot.  I also find that the effects linger for quite a while, so if I smoke on monday, tuesday I may not need as much to get the same effect.  Catnip with a tiny bit of lobelia powder is really great, a bit like nicotine but not addictive.  I usually add some mullein, though, to help hold the powder.



Then last november my girlfriend made me stop smoking, so I had to find other ways.  The first thing I tried was chewing it.  I'd take a few leaves fresh off the plant and chewed about 5 of them, holding the juice under my tongue.  The effects came on slower, were a little milder, and lasted longer, but were still enjoyable.  When the leaves lose their bitterness and flavor, they are spat out.  Next I made a tincture of the herb in IPA, evaporated it down to the water, and mixed it with an equal part of glycerin.  I put a few drops in a glass tube and heat up the bottom until it vaporizes, inhaling the vapors.  This works well too, but I need more extract to get the effects of the same amount of herb.  



Finally, I've been using a tea.  I give my mom a tea as a sedative, and she finds it works alot better than other herbs and doesn't leave her with a medicine head feeling like Tylenol PM and diphenhydramine.  The effects are also more mild here than with smoking, but longer lasting and more sedative.  It's important that you drink it fast before the oils evaporate.  



I'm also experimenting with a tincture, but that won't be ready for a few weeks.  I would use it sublingually or orally as a sedative.  Overall, catnip is a great herb, but it doesn't give any fireworks.  It makes my day just that much more interesting without interfering with my daily routine or making me paranoid about random drug tests.
