Living outside of the infamous `city of sin', I have ample access to any myraid of chemicals or indulgences I could possibly wish to indulge in. And this, seemingly being my big year of exploration, is the year that I decided to try methamphetamine for the first time. Not only meth, but I only started smoking pot early this year, so it's been a quick progression. Anything worth doing is worth doing right, right? 



I met the person I ended up doing it with through work. We only worked together about a week, then he mysteriously disappeared after I mentioned a vague interest in trying it for the first time. I pretty much lost interest, except for the random occassion when a more `experienced' friend would mention it. Oddly enough, after 2 months of not seeing him at all, I ran into him during a lunch break at my job, he mentioned it and we exchanged numbers. It was that same night that I took the `plunge'. When I tried meth, I had only dabbled in ganja smoking and a gram or two of cocaine, so I was (and presumably am still) a `newbie'. My experienced friend kicked in with me and we got \$35 worth, a bowl or two of which I smoked with the suppliers before going to her house.



Anyhow, when I first tried it, I was naive as all hell. I knew it was addictive, so that scared the shit out of me, and I had seen the movie SPUN, so I had a mild idea of what I could possibly be getting myself into. They showed me how to load a bowl and how to smoke it, the two people I was with taking the first few hits before passing the pipe to me.



The first thing I noticed was the taste. It tasted like I'd imagine Pinesol would smell (I unfortunately lack a sense of smell), and all I really felt was a mild head rush and my heart rate increased. I didn't know if it was from my own nervousness or the drug (now I know it's the drug). I also noticed how much easier it went down compared to pot, without any of the burn that I normally experience with weed. We probably smoked 2-3 bowls total, but it wasn't an overwhelming high, I just knew that I was AWAKE. I'd already been awake 16 or so hours when we got around to doing it, so I was pretty tired.



After that, I went to my experienced friend's house. We talked for hours, and it was some of the best conversation we'd ever had, like coke, and we did 2 lines each over the course of the night, the first around midnight and the last ones around 4:30-5:00 am. Doing the lines hurt, there's no easy way around it. It felt like my nasal tissue was \emph{literally} being eaten away, especially the second time. Around five, one of her friends who lives in the `Big City' convinced us to go to his party, which was rather unexciting, but we stayed 5-6 hours anyway. Why not? We were awake and had nothing better to do, hah. 



After that, we returned to our little suburbia and parted ways. I was awake until 7:30 PM the next day, when I crashed HARD. That's the main reason I don't like meth. Outside of the fear of addiction, I HATE the comedown. Neither of us had any more after we did the 2nd lines, so all we really could do was come down, which I much prefer to `binging', which I'm too afraid to ever do. I felt like shit by noon the next day, and I tried to eat with another friend of mine and couldn't get through half of a sandwich before I felt ill. All day I felt paranoid that someone could tell what was going on, and I was in an overall bad mood that kept getting worse. My dad asked me to go the store and I nearly had a breakdown because I was SO fucking TIRED and all I wanted to do was SLEEP and stop feeling so damn SHITTY. 



I've done meth a total of three or four times since then, usually going a week or more between each use, over two weeks this last time. I can see why people enjoy doing it, especially if they smoke it, but the comedown isn't worth it to me. I feel absolutely wretched for days afterwords, and refuse to EVER buy it for myself now. I'm just too afraid of addiction to use it with any frequency, and I like being relatively sober (outside of ganja smoking), so it's not something I see myself doing very often, if at all. I don't see much of an upside to it other than being awake all night and maybe losing some weight, but it's just not worth it to me.
