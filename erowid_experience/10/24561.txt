 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  

  

11hr \ldots  I go online and read about affects of DXM and reasure myself that it's all in my head and that it's the typical fuzziness of the day after coricidin.  



13 hr \ldots  It's about one pm and I decide to get some sleep since I haven't had much.  I have calmed down by ths point.



19hr \ldots  I wake up and watch tv.  Everything is normal until I go outside and smoke a cigarette. I had been smoking through the whole c-hit experience, but hadn't had a cig since about 10 that morning.  About half way through the cigarette the nicotine hit me.  My heart started racing tremendously, I was hyperventilating slighty, I put my cigarette out right then and walked inside thinking that I'd sleep through it.  I went to my room, closed my eyes and started to experience the flying feeling again, except this time I was traveling up into a light.  I was convinced I was going to die.



I went down stairs and noticed my mother watching tv.  I went to her and asked her to feel my heart.  She said it was a little fast but not dangerous.  To me it felt like it was about to beat out of my chest.  I started freaking out.  My fingers and feet went cold, I KNEW I was about to die.  I told my mom to take me to the hospital.  I did not tell her that I had done any drugs.  She recognized that I was having a panic attack and tried to calm me down.  I began to cry because I thought my life was going to end because of stupid coricidin.  The anxiety attacks came in waves for two more hours.  I'd get a grip on myself and then spiral out of control emotionally.  At one point I told my mother to take me to the emergency room.  I found that washing my hands, walking around, or looking in the mirror grounded my manic mental state. 



My mother and her mother have a history of anxiety, and luckily my mom was there to help me through this.  I am 17 years old and have never experienced anxiety or panic attacks in my life.  This had to be the scariest thing I have ever been through.  My mind was in a different state and I think for that one day I was mildly crazy.  I had no control over my fears at all.  The next day I felt very depressed.  The world seemed devoid of all life and happiness.  I could only see objects as physical things that were empty.  Everything was like props in a play.  I cried on and off.  I no longer feared that I was going to die but I thought I had made myself stupid from the drug and that my brain would never be the same.  I was caught in this weird loop of being stuck in myself and in emptiness.  The next day was much the same, but after that things got better.



It has now been about a week since this experience and a faint echo of fear lingers in my mind.  I am no longer scared of going insane, dying, or dumbing myself, but this persistant essence of fear is present in most of my thoughts.  There is no reason for it and I don't understand it.  I am just thankful that the extreme anxiety and depression flips have gone away and I can return to my normal life.



The only conclusion that I can come to about this hell of an aftermath is that the DXM and other shit in coricidin screwed with my brain chemistry.  A week and a half before this experience, I did ecstasy for the first time, and think that perhaps my brain had not recovered full serotonin levels before the DXM.  Maybe this is like how LSD surfaces dormant mental problems, although I've never heard of it happening with DXM.  I have done that same amount of c-hit before with no problems, and my friends did not experience any problems from the same stuff I took.  Whatever the case is, I'm never going to do coricidin ever again and I strongly advise against it.  If you want to have an out of body experience, feel oneness, or just trip, stick with straight DXM.
