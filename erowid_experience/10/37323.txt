Today I acquired a few ultracet pills. I did a little research on the net and decided on an dose of two pills. This yields a total dose of 75 mg tramadol/650 mg acetaminophen. The cannabis I had was a very high grade hydro. I'm unsure of the exact strain, but it is very good. Like you haven't heard that before.



T-1:30 

I ate a full dinner.



T+0:00              

I took both ultracets orally.



T+0:15        

Smoked approx. .5 grams of high grade bud.



T+45 mins        

I think I start to feel something other than the weed. A little bit opiate in nature but definitely something else to it. I feel quite alert.



T+1 hr 15 min    

Not quite sure I've hit the plateau because it keeps getting hard to type. Excellent euphoric body sensations. The torso feels so light.



T+1 hr 40 min    

Good friend called conversation was fluid and warm. Conversations with this particular friend usually go this way but it was better this time.



T+2 hr 25 min    

Past peak still going strong more weed or another ultracet will spike me back up.



Weed definately amplifies the action of this drug. I did not feel any of the nausea that others have reported with this drug. I also feel `speedy' as others have reported but I have noticed this with opiates antagonist drugs ( oxycoden, hydracoden, codine, etc. ). B+ combo. A little short lived for my taste, but to be expected considering the ingredients.
