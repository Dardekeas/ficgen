Experience: Everything except crystal meth and crack (bad anxiety disorder, stimulants bug me out) also fyi never injected anything.



I havent rolled or taken mdma in about 8 years since highschool after a bad experience where it was wayy too speedy for me. I did achieve E-tard status in highschool and currently take zoloft because my brains seratonin is messed up. So after dilligently doing lots of research I found 6-APB my answer to hopefully brining the  joy of rolling face back into my life.



Ill describe two experiences even though since ive discovered this compound ive done it probably 10 times in the past 2 months, virtually no side effects still fully active even on zoloft (if you dont know ssris will kill your roll used to be a trick we used to come down back in the day)



Package comes we guinnea pig it to a friend. This friend took 90mg reported that he didnt notice much was happier and more talkative. The next day he told us he forgot to mention, he was up for 2 days doing coke, taking xanax and drinking. He was also around a girlfriend who hates drugs.



So that was friday, saturday comes. I figure fuck it these are bunk I take 2 90mg capsules (and yes I found a legal way to obtain them in USA ;) ). 30 minutes passes I dont feel literally anything, decide I want to go bang this girl.I go over her house. Shes a junkie who does heroin regularly. We go to camden and pick her up a few bags. She shoots them, were in the car ride back and all of the sudden I feel like im piloting a space ship (hour into roll right now)



 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



Holy fuck lights are very intense, I am very talkative. All I can stop thinking about is how amazing the world has become and how I wish everybody could feel as good as this right now. The girl was passing out from shooting up and killing my buzz so I peaced out. I met up with some of my rolling buddies at a local walmart. Lol I was waiting at wallmart for them around 15 minutes. It literally felt like an hour had gone by.



2-3? Hours into roll. I have completely lost track of time, it is going by very slow for me. Lights at wallmart are amazing. I buy vicks vapor rub and it enhances the roll fantastically, I think im mentally addicted to it. Every inhale of vapor rub feels like a full body orgasm.



3-? Meet up with my friends they all drop it. I felt this was soo similiar to ecstacy that I just told them it was MDMA. We each took 135mg. My friend V goes into the shower. He returns about 45 minutes later declaring that it was the most amazing shower he has ever taken. I kill time with mr Yson, listening to music feels fantastic\ldots  Deadmau5 is a genius\ldots .





8hr into roll I relize the whole day has gone by in a very happy bliss. I drive an hour home (one again feels like a space ship, 6-APB is very trippy compaired to E, expect more eye wiggles, more light trails, more depth perception fuck ups lol)



9hrs, Made it home safe, I meet up with my brother he used to be a huge fan of E back in the day. I explain to him how magical this is and that he needs to try it. He drops and within an hour hes rolling faced with me, he also is on an ssri so we both didnt think a roll was achievable but we were wrong. 



10hrs - Very strong euphoria, I love the redosing ability of this chem, its wild u can roll for like 10 hours drop again and roll again for another 10 hours



10-20hrs - Took another 90mg snorted this time (highly dont reccomend burns like shit) the next 10 hours were fucking awesome I decieded I kept checking my phone too much and put it down after having lots of fun with the strobe light app. Put deadmau5 meowington hax tour toronto on projector in movie theatre. It is amazing. This drug is fantastic I could be perfectly contect just chilling or I could be bouncing off the walls.



This is very very trippy. The part where from my experience this differs from E is the its note like candy flipping where you imagine shit its like shrooming on E. The tiles in my bathroom floor are all swirling and moving. VERY VERY INTERESTING EFFECT OF THIS DRUG THAT I HAVENT GOTTEN WITH ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE\ldots  SHARED VISUALS!!!\ldots  



We smoke a cigarette outside my bro mentions to me that the railing is waving at us, next thing I know its all wiggly and crazy loooking. With my friends weve noticed similiar things on this drug. Somebody goes hey look those bricks are pulsating and all 6 of us start seeing them wave like jello.



Side notes:

Amazing highly reccomend, I favor this to ecstacy you know what your getting its not cut with anything very very clean roll, all my friends rated it 8/10.



Sleep is very difficult. I wouldnt even attempt it without xanax, my friends and I just dropped more and used that to wake us up and we rolled the next day lol.



Redosing is very very cool effect of this drug.

The fact that it works fully functionally while on an ssri is nuts.



Seems to give the world a very purply/blue glow very similiar to mdma\ldots 



And thats about all till my  next trip tomorrow. The more ppl on this at once the better the experience it keeps you from drifting too far off mentally. I noticed very little anxiety with this that I thought was super easy to just plain old think away.
