About 3 nights before I smoked the blunt with my boys I had taken 3 30mg capsules of Adderall XR (Extended Release). I was speeding balls and ended up staying up all day for 3 nights. On the day I smoked the blunt I was trippin, most likely because of lack of sleep. But anyways I took about 4 hits of the blunt when, WHAM, it hit me so suddenly. I thought I was having a heart attack. My chest killed me and it had a tingling feeling. I couldn't  stop shaking and I felt as if I was a lonely soul in the world. I tried talking to my bros but they didn't answer probably cause I was mumbling. That night I was still feeling the effects.



For the next week I got very little (5-10 hrs) of sleep. Then finally I ended up trying to smoke another bowl I took two hits and it was as worse as it was the first time last week. Eventually (2-3 weeks) the effects wore off. But ever since my weed smoking experience has never been the same. Every time I smoke now I get the same feeling as I did when I was speeding. I fear it has ruined marijuana smoking forever.
