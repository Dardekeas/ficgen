This was the biggest event that has ever happened to me, and I would like people to know it can happen. To start out, at the time of my overdose, I was a full on perscription opiate junky. I had a huge tolerance for Oxycontin, and the dosages I took reflect that.



I woke up in the morning, got ready for class. Before I go to class I snort 160mg of powdered oxycontin, and take 10mg of valium. I go to class as normal, I was used to taking huge drug dosages to get me ready for the day. During lunchbreak I met with my friend Tim, and we proceeded to do a couple lines of cocaine each. I'm not sure of the potency, but it did little to effect me on the amount of downers I was already on. Before returning to class we both snorted another 40mg of oxycontin.



I finished up school early, and popped another 10mg of valium. I was feeling very high, but I had handled dosages like this many times before and knew I could handle it. I met Tim after school and we went to his friend Hannah's apartment. There I chopped up an entire 80mg pill. This was my accident. I was intending on only snorting another 40mg, which would max me out at 240mg, where I always stopped. Instead, accidently, i snorted the entire 80mg pill. I remember thinking in my mind something to the effect of `oh fuck'. Within a couple of minutes I had lost conciousness. The next thing I remember is waking  up in the ER. Even though I was given anti-narcotics, I was still pretty incoherent. I remember a feeling of relief washing over me, thankful I wasn't dead. I looked at myself, and I must have had 6 IV's in me. My parents walked into the ER standing over me crying. They left quickly. I started puking charcoal into the oxygen mask and passed back out.



I woke up the next morning completely drained of energy, unable to concentrate, but most of all frightened and angry. I spent the next 4 days in the Intensive Care Unit. I had suffered a heart attack, kidney and liver failure. I don't think it was just the oxy, that had effected by kidneys and liver, I had been on a drug binge for 3 months. The doctors weren't sure if they would go back to normal. My parents would cry every time they saw me for the next 2 weeks. Once I got out of Intensive Care, I still couldn't walk for 4 days, My chest would just be overwhelmed in pain and i'd fall onto the floor.



After this, I went to rehab. All in all, it was a horrible experience that I will never forget. The doctors said if Tim and Hannah didn't call 911 when they did, I would be dead. It took me 3 weeks for my brain to go back to semi-normal thought patterns, and another 6 months to return to normal completely. The experience was stupid on my part, but it was what I needed to get off the terrible addictive force known as oxycontin. Ever since, the issue oxy has been a reoccuring battle in my mind. I will never forget how wonderful it made me feel in the face of any kind of misery. On the other hand, it nearly cost me my life. I have decided no matter how great it was, life is better.
