I would consider myself a rather experienced psychonaught, experiences ranging from dxm to pharmahuasca and just about every popular one in between.  Last night a good friend of mine and I, whom I have known my literally my  whole life (21) got together to take a journey into the realms. He had just under and eighth of mushrooms and I had 3 tabs of LSD, so we split both and decided a synergy would be better than eating our own separate share, and to be on the same level for sure. 

	We took them at around 730pm in my parents house as they had gone away for the weekend, and my house is my favorite place to journey.  Having never tried this combo, thus having no idea what to expect, we waited anxiously for the Other to manifest. 

	After a long rant by my friend, which marked the beginning of the effects, I was almost unable to handle all of his energy, so I suggested we smoke a cigarette, some hashish, and go chill in the living room. I have never noticed how trippy wall paper is before this. For about 2 hours my eyes were absolutely glued to the incredibly lush growth swirling and blooming and growing and receding across my entire wall. It was divine. Mckenna's idea that we are, as a human species, about to have a cosmic birth kept running through my mind as I watched these hundreds of flowers animatedly swirling and budding themselves into a frenzy. This unraveled into a vision of the absolute infiniteness of dimensions, how you can go as big or small as you want but the universe never ends. And it continues to do one thing- exactly what these flowers are doing on my wall, birth itself into existence.

	As far as effects go, the LSD really seemed to overpower the mushrooms, which is unfortunate because I am partial to the spiritual wisdom that seems to be contained in the fungus.  I was hoping for it to be overall less speedy, but it was perfectly enjoyable none the less. Aside from DMT, this was probably one of the most visual trips I have had, these two really synergize quite well together visually. Also, about 3 of 6 hours of this trip was spent laughing hysterically, which seemed to be more pronounced as a result of the combo. 

	But there were some parts of the trip, though not unbearable, that were slightly unpleasant because the `impending doom-ness' I sometimes get with mushrooms, that `fight or flight' stimulation, was being mixed up with the speediness of the LSD, along with the amazing visions, all of it made for a feeling of ecstasy I don't think I've encountered anywhere else. It was intense, but good intense, yet almost so super duper intense and feels so good it doesn't feel good because I need to explode right now. Kind of like that.

	One of the most amazing things happened while we were sitting in my living room. My friend always talks about how visions come in waves, and I haven't noticed it much before. But he kept calling out when the waves would begin and when they would end, and every time I found myself lost in a vision, he would say, ahhh that was a good one, just as my vision was subsiding to reality. This happened regularly throughout the night, and I am convinced there is something beyond what can be rationally explained here. A scientific explanation for this is the `waves' are pharmacological; just rushes of the drug in your brain being broken down while new molecules stream in. What are the chances this would cycle simultaneously for both of us? I think its far more incomprehensible than metabolism or anything any human could put into words.

	Later, when my friend left, I had an incredible experience. The countertops in my kitchen are white marble imitation, and when I gazed into this cloudy white marble pattern, literally, the universe was revealed to me. I could see the principle on which all things in existence work. I watched as this divine matrix breathed and pulsed with ever novel archetypes. I saw Michelangelo's Sistine chapel-esque landscapes,  waves, cosmic galaxies, all transforming eventually into a matrix, that, after I looked for a minute, I realized was a picture-perfect representation of a cellular matrix, but it looked like that of a plant more than an animal. I could the see the building blocks of the building blocks of the building blocks\ldots you get the idea This was truly satisfying, and it sheds light for me on the importance of having these experiences alone, once you have enough experience, as it allows you to really dissolve more and more boundaries, falling deeper into the cosmic awareness at your own will. Other people keep you grounded, even if they are tripping. Sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes it isn't.	

	Later in the trip, I tried getting into some yogic activities, but I couldn't concentrate long enough. I was too stimulated. I've only taken LSD a few times, and I don't ever remember being that stimulated, but I've found psilocybin to be sedating so, I don't know how that worked out. Anyways, I thought I'd mention it as yoga/meditation holistic breathwork, drumming, etc is something I've found to be incredibly wholesome and rewarding. Any spiritual practice combined with a psychedelic is the tried and true way to have a safe, profound, meaningful experience.  Archaic techniques of ecstasy I believe they are called.

	Overall, I enjoy the smoothness and tranquility mushrooms provide, compared to the hyperactivity of LSD, so for next time I may try mushrooms and an ayahuasca vine. I wasn't very pleased with the way the LSD took over the trip so to speak, but it was highly meaningful, highly enjoyable, and much needed nonetheless.  If you are thinking of doing this, especially if you are limited in materials, the synergy provides a more powerful experience than either would produce alone at double the dosage. I would recommend for experienced seekers and up.
