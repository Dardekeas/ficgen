11:00pm : took the drug, Ordered it online, unfortunately the pills got crushed while being shipped so I had to pour he powder into a soda.



11:40pm : drug kicks in. Felt really hot and tingly all over my body, before I have been scared of this, but because I had friends with me previously, they actually told me I was very cold, so I wasn't worried. Put on a sweater.



12:30am: plateau, gaming and listening to music, cant stop moving my legs, lots of fun. 



1:30am: coming down but don't seem to have any major side effects. 



Summary: nice drug, being that I've done weed and dxm before was a different experience, suggest listening to music. Having friends around in previous uses of Meopp made me very talkative and cheerful, this particular time I didn't have any friends over. But still a nice experience.
