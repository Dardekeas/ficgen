I'm a moderate to heavy drinker. A night of drinking for me will usually start around 8pm and go until close (2am). In this time period I have no problem drinking constantly while still maintaining a trace of sobriety (i.e. I can always walk, talk etc; I rarely puke or experience dissorientation). 



The beginning of one night several weeks ago boggled my mind. I usually don't respond well to weed - I'm a sleeper. I take a few drags on a joint and get all glazey eyed and have to make an effort to speak and interact socially. 



Whatever. 



We had been around drinking for a while when someone sparked up a joint and I thought why not join in\ldots  Half a minute later we were getting ready to go and I put on my jacket. My vision shot off into the distance and I fell to the ground. I couldn't feel my body or understand where I was or what was happening. Slowly, after and indeterminable period of time (it felt like I had briefly been outside of time) I could here voices of concern talking about me and `me' seemed like an odd thing. Then the sensation that someone was touching me and talking directly to my face faded in. I clambered up to my feet and almost fell over - what was this? I'd just gotten started drinking and I felt like I was a teenager hammered off their first beer. I moved to a couch and collapsed. I was in an uncomfortable position but my arms wouldn't move to correct it. My face felt cold and tight and I could barely form words. I was paralyzed! All this from a couple drags on a joint?



The next day when I woke up I noted a massive bloody scrape on my knee where I had fallen (luckily my arms broke my fall saving my face!) It was soaked right through to the front of my pants .. yummy!



I suppose the moral is to understand how you react in a safe setting before mixing things in the wild. I can only imagine the results if a similar incident had happend at a bar, or anywhere in public for that matter. It also reaffirms my own personal suspicion.. mj and beer don't mix good at all.
