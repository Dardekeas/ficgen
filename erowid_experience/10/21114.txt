Mind Set: Curious to objectively evaluate a rarely tried substance



Having ingested 800 mg of piracetam in the form of an orange, notched tablet of Nootropil, I have decided that it would be best to do this `live and direct.' That is, rather than describing (possibly biased) recollections of my `trip' hours after the fact, I will be reporting my experiences as they come.



For starters, let's begin with dosage (i.e. the `recipe'). I took the hydergine and piracetam separately, each with a capsule of choline and a glass of water. As implied, the hydergine was taken first, the piracetam following not more than three minutes later.



Although I've followed the same recipe at least a dozen times before, I am a bit nervous and drink another glass of water. The only thing making this time different is that I took the tablets later in the day.



As usual, I don't notice any major changes in perception or emotion. I feel slightly less inclined to express myself or communicate with anyone in general. This is probably because I realize that over 90\% of my ordinary speech is meaningless `clutter.' I also notice that I am slightly more inclined to `read into' names and titles. I scramble and reverse the names of tracks I am listening to, and I compute the sums and products of random numbers. But it is hard for me to notice any changes in perceptual ability or computational speed. I simply `feel' more `aware' (possibly placebo).



I return from having discussed with someone. Effects are often best noticed when discussing with others. I realized that I could recall facts and names that I would have otherwise thought were forgotten. But the differences are not strong enough for me to notice them without trying to.



An hour and a half after taking the tablets, either the effects or my willingness to detect them is wearing out. I am beginning to feel tired and this report will soon end.



A common and only side effect I have noticed is a slight feeling of nausea. This is alleviated by the choline, but it is still present.



For those of you expecting sudden, dramatic changes in perception and intellect, neither piracetam nor hydergine is a magic potion. It may be true that repeated daily dose can increase your overall intelligence, as I have yet to experiment with such a regimen. But a single dose is, as has been pointed out, either `subtle or nothing.'



Much more experimentation has to be done with these substances before we can categorize them as either nootropics or snake oil. I encourage others to experiment freely with similar combinations, if not to improve their own abilities, to contribute to our knowledge as a whole.
