I bought some AMT a couple weeks ago and I had been looking foreward to trying it out.  However, because of the many reports of vomitting I put it off until the weekend before Christmas.  I was expecting an extremely long acid like trip and that is exactly what I got.



Setting:  My apartment, the movie theater and a parking lot.  Very familiar with all places.



Preperations:  Emptied a pill cap and replaced the contents with between forty and fifty mg of AMT.  Had full stomach (Bad Idea).



Mindset:  Positive



Experience:  I took one pill at 7 pm ona Saturday and proceeded to go get some groceries.  After returning to my house I waited for C and K to come over.  It started to kick in after about an hour and felt very similar to acid.  At 8:15 I threw up once.  It wasn't too bad and I might not have thown up if I had not eaten right before I dosed.  Friends show up at nine.  I am by now tripping pretty good and am unable to roll a couple of joints.  Threw up again right after they got there.  I was begining to think that this was going to be a very sick trip after all but that was the end of my stomach troubles (thanks mary jane).  



After ramp up th trip was smooth and enjoyable.  It would come on in waves but otherwise buzz and visuals were almost exactly like acid.  We smoked up and them my friends went to someone elses house to drop some stuff off.  After they left (9:30) I decided that my trip had settled down enough for me to drive over to a parking lot to meet a friend and pay him some money I owed.  Driving was very fun!  I felt like I was floating down the road at incredible speeds and I kept seeing fist sized white dots float across the road.   \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 



Jaw clenching and teeth grinding begins at 10pm.  Smoked two bowls with fried R and felt great!  We went to see The Two Towers at 11:15.  Getting tickets proved to be a little difficult in my current state but I managed to get past all the ushers and cops and to the theater.  My pupils by this time dominated my entire eyes.  It was pretty obvious what was going on.  When we got to the theater R and I went to the exit to smoke a cigarette.  As soon as we opened the door a cop pulled up and asked to see our tickets.  Good thing he didn't inspect us too close.  We both reeked of high grade weed, whiskey, and my eyes were exploding.  



Just stayed cool and walked back to our seats.  No problems with paranoia.  The movie was great.  Parts of the screen would spin around or change colors but I could still follow the movie fine.  Patternization was also nice to look at.  Tracers were pretty good too.  When the movie was over I smoked up then went back home and waited for some other friends to get there. It was 3am by this time and I was still tripping.  There never seemed to be a peak at any time.  I just went up, got sick on the way, and the leveled off for many many hours.  All and all I smoked nine bowls of good good weed throughout the night and tripped for around 15-18 hours.  Ingestion at 7pm and baseline at 3pm the next day.  Very good trip after the ramp up.  Comparable to two hits of acid in almost all ways (except racing thoughts were not there or easy to control I can't remember).  Next time I will definitly take between 60 and 70 mg.  



Overall rating for this substance: B+.  Rating could improve at higher doses.  First decent replacement for acid that I have tried.
