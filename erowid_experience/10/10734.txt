Night started off well; basic plan was to stay at the apartment with my boyfriend and split an 8-ball. Plan was in effect, it was great coke, and a neighbor was over having some wine and chatting. Night wore on, coke wore on, neighbor deigned to share. I am a pretty avid user when I use, so it's my guess I snorted the lion's share - but felt very in control. Party migrated 2 doors down to said neighbors, where we continued, sans coke. Jitters and uneasiness set in about 5:30 AM, that icky time, when I usually pop a Klonopin or 2. Neighbor spoke up - `I have something that will bring you down!' and pulls out a glass of semi-cloudy liquid. Purportedly GHB, then he explained it was 1,4. I had heard of GHB, but only knew it as `liquid ecstasy'. Took a gulp, and took a little more after a few minutes, as neighbor gave disclaimer that `you'll feel great for a few minutes and then you'll fall asleep'. Understatement. 



I felt AMAZING for about 10 minutes - better than the best roll I've ever had on MDMA. And that's the last thing I remember. Apparently I went into the bathroom, fell off the toilet, hit my face (and got the worst black eye I'd ever seen), went into convulsions, and spent the next 3 hours in complete hysterical disorientation, half-naked on neighbor's stripped bed, vomiting everywhere. 



Moral of the story? 

1. I will never agree to do any drug I know little/nothing about/never tried while I are high on another drug - REASONING IMPAIRED. 

2. I won't mix prescription meds with illicit ones unless I know they work together! (I have bipolar disorder and take massive amounts of lithium, Topamax, Seroquel, Klonopin).
