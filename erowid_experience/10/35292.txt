I had been originally planning my nutmeg experience to begin in the morning around 9:00 a.m. but was unable to begin until about 1:00 p.m. the same day. I prepared for this experience by the method I have tried and found to be a universal preparation for psychoactive substances. Fasting - 3 days for something new and potentially strong, 1-3 days for anything less.  For this experience I fasted for 2 days, praying, meditating, and removing the mental barrier that holds us all back every day in our mundane lives.  As with most experiences I use cannabis as a measurable stimulant throughout the experience.  Cannabis has a positive effect in every experience I have partaken in.  



10:00 a.m. Smoked Cannabis and a little cigar, meditated and prayed, listened to some mentally positive music.



1:00 p.m.  Ingested 9 grams of store bought nutmeg powder.  I measured the dose by teaspoons.  9 grams is about half of the recommended dose for my body weight.  I chose to consume only half the recommended dose so I could more accurately account for the effects introduced by the nutmeg.  Various methods have been employed as to reduce the feared `awful' taste of nutmeg ranging from teas, slushies and just shoving spoonfuls in your mouth.  I chose to consume the nutmeg the same way I take pills.  I measured out 1 teaspoon of nutmeg; I took some orange juice in my mouth and tilted my head back.  Just as I would drop a pill in my mouth and swallow it with the water all in one swallow, having the pill not come in contact with the forepart of the tongue, I dropped the teaspoon of nutmeg into my mouth.  Head titled back with the juice, I could not taste the nutmeg at all.  I swallowed it all down; a faint taste of nutmeg could be tasted but nothing that would constitute a negative taste reaction.  I continued in this fashion until all 3 teaspoons were taken.  After consuming the nutmeg in this fashion the remaining taste was minimal and not at all unpleasant.  I drank the rest of my orange juice and the flavor of nutmeg was gone.  The whole process of consuming took no more than 2 minutes.



2:00 p.m. Minor effects were noticeable and comparable to those felt on my previous P. Cubensis experience.  A heightened sense of being and clarity gave me reason to suspect the nutmeg was beginning to take effect.  I smoked some more cannabis and continued to meditate with some music.  Unsure as to the effects of nutmeg on my body I contemplated consuming another couple of grams and maybe up to another 9 bringing me to the recommended dose but decided to wait.



4:00 p.m. Meditation breaks through into `the vibration'.  Subtle and Gentle were the effects throughout the experience.  In `The Vibration'' I encountered many things as I did in that state with P. Cubensis.  Relaxed and centered I smoke some more cannabis and some more tobacco.  Effects were heightened by the intake of these two.  The cannabis had a broad heightening effect as it elevated every feeling, whereas the tobacco was more short term.  Throughout the day I continued my experience by smoking more cannabis and some more tobacco as I felt the desire to.  Listening to music in privacy and peace while sitting outside for the majority of the experience I enjoyed the nice weather and a cool breeze. 



7:00 p.m. Made something to eat and enjoyed it.



11:00 p.m. Preparing for bed and feeling ready to sleep I have not felt any negative effects throughout the day and continue to feel positive and pleasant.  I go to sleep and sleep fine.



NEXT DAY



8:00 a.m.  Awake, feeling pleasant and calm.  `The Vibration' is no longer felt but remains of the initial onset from the first hour or so of the previous day continue to be felt in a pleasant manner.  Feelings that I would relate to a minor cannabis effect, subtle and pleasant.  The rest of the second day passed in the same state.  I went about my day as I always do unimpeded by any kind of negative after effect.  



FOLLOWING DAY



8:00 a.m.  Awakening from a dream, remembering my dream, laughing out loud at the nonsense I was dreaming about I noted the ability to remember my dream with clarity.  For the past few years I have not been able to remember my dreams.  I normally pass the night in sleep, awakening into the new day with nothing hanging in my mind from a dream and normally feeling like I did not dream at all.  This day I could vividly remember my entire dream which seemed like it went on for a long time and covered a lot of ground, places, people and activities.  Interesting.  A pleasant after effect that remains with me.  



Conclusion:  I have found nutmeg to suit me just fine and I plan on another experience with the recommended dose to follow here in just a few weeks.  Consumed like a pill I never had a moment of nausea, headaches or any kind of negative effect.  I would recommend proper preparation for any experience and encourage those who have thought about nutmeg to give it a try.  I hope this report shines a little light on one of our little known and widely misunderstood friend in nature, Nutmeg.
