Ok, as a molecular biologist and one who's curiosity has gotten me into more trouble than good, I just had to try this poppy tea I have read so much about.



Part I



First, I am really confused about the legality of the whole thing, some say it is legal to have dried pods, others say it is illegal. I figure if they are being sold at craft stores (where I bought them) I am sure the DEA knows all about it. SO I went with the assumption that it is legal and gave it a whirl.



I sent away for some dried pods, I got 20 dried ornamental pods for \$10 (I was only supposed to get 10, go figure?). When they came, I was so excited I couldn't wait to try it\ldots so I immediately ground up 1 pod to make the tea. I am very sensative to chemicals, so figured I better just see what one does.



I recieved 20 randomly sized pods, so I just selected a medium sized pod. Cut the stem away, collected all the seeds (just because I had memorized the protocol..I have no idea what I will do with the seeds\ldots I KNOW growing live plants is illegal). After the seeds were collected I got the good ol coffee grinder out and puverized the pod into dust. I mean it was so powdered it looked like I used a morter and pestle.



I then boiled some water and when it reached boiling I poured it into a cup with the powder already waiting. I let it sit for 15 minutes, then made a aluminum foil filter (didn't have anything else). and drank the yellow, brown liquid down\ldots 



It didn't taste as bad as I had read, yet it was only 1 pod..anyway, I didn't think I felt anything really because I had taken and anti-histamine for my sinus infection and cold. However, I slept like a rock! I slept for 10 hours and I NEVER sleep that long.. I woke up feeling a little groggy and I don't know if it was from the opium or the anti-histamine\ldots  But it gets better\ldots .



I felt so crummy that I called in sick..then I had the bright idea to try a little more and see if I could really get some sleep or that feeling I read about\ldots 



Let me say this before even starting with the good part of this story\ldots I have taken percocet and vicodin for post surgical pain and they make me really happy and loving.



Ok, part II



I ground up all the remaining 19 pods and decided to evaluate differing dosages. I seperated the ground pod powder into a bag with 7 grams (3 poppy pods), one with 10 grams (5 poppy pods), and one with 15 grams (10 poppy pods).



I got a really good idea on how to filter the pod muck\ldots I used a coffee filter! ah ahah ah coffee grinder--coffee filter..it all made sense\ldots  Well, I used the 7 gram (3 pod) batch\ldots  that was at 11:30 am. It is now 6:15 pm and I am still feeling it strongly.



At first I felt very nauseous and got a headache, I had what felt like a rubberband feeling around my skull. It didn't feel good at all. As a matter of fact, it never even came close to the feeling of a percocet or vicodin. All it did was make me tired and made my limbs feel really heavy. I told a freind it felt like I took sea sickness pill (dramamine). It was good for my cold/flu/sinus infection thing though, because I have been resting really well, even sleeping a little. But nowhere around was that euphoric feeling I was after. Oh well. As it is, that was the last high I had any desire to try. I have come to the conclusion that having a clear head, great relationships, lots of friends and working hard is the best high there is\ldots .and I have tried almost all of them.
