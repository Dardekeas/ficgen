Trazodone, an anti-depressant I used to be on, was discovered by me in my parents medicine cabinet recently. Back then I had no interest in drugs, now (under two years later) I did. I took some of the old pills, nobody would notice as they were no longer in use. The pills, though I don't know the mg, were about the size of an Aleve, I took 10 of them. A few nights before I had 4 and enjoyed it, so I figured why not boost the dose. 



Keep in mind, at this time, though not suicidal, I didn't care if I DID die from the experience\ldots  or so I thought. The pills numbed me and made me happy after about 20 minutes, as I watched TV.
