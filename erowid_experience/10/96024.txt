It was a Friday afternoon approximately 8:00 pm, I went to my friend A's house where I normally hang out before work. I work 3rd shift in the emergency room in the hospital closest to where I live. I had only slept about 2 hours that day. I was extremely tired and a bit stressed out for various reasons. I haven't been eating properly the past few days due to a severe toothache, I was malnutrition'd, overly exhausted and a bit depressed which I think were all contributing factors to the events that proceeded.



Where it's at\ldots 



In A's garage about 9:15pm, we put roughly 5mg into a bowl that had previously had powder chemical in it. Sometimes we put it on the tip of our cigarette, sometimes we light the tip of the chemical'd cig and put that in a bowl, really it depends on how we feel like doing it that day and we did it several times a day everyday since we started. We take one hit; we start to feel good, my body feels so heavy, my head feels heavy, my eyes feel heavy, my body gets that awesome tingly feeling it gets, I love my skin on this stuff I feel AMAZING, one hitch I don't want to go to work, I'm tired. I say `man I don't wanna go to work' A says `haha I have off the next 4 days' must be nice I mumble then she starts laughing so I start laughing, but somethings wrong her laugh is evil she's not laughing with me she's laughing AT ME?!? I have to back up I'm on the floor rolling around I think I'm screaming and shaking my head trying to calm her down I don't want to scare her WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? I'm going to die, it goes blank\ldots .



First off you should know this\ldots 



I feel I am fairly experienced at these cannabinoids even though I have only been using them for about a month. Previously I was an avid pot smoker, I liked opiates (pain killers) and would occasionally inject myself with IV morphine, only small amounts. I was also on various anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and anti-anxiety pills for severe depression and bi-polar disorder. Currently was on Paxil and Xanax. Since acquiring this chemical from another friend, I started ordering it online myself and have been using it ever since, going as far as to completely quit everything else I was using including my prescribed medicines. This has replaced everything I used to need. It was my wonder drug, it calmed me down, made me happy, made me super horny my sex drive was through the roof and it was wonderful that I found a friend that I loved to experience it with me. My dear A\ldots 



Back to that fucked up night\ldots 



I'm waking up in an ambulance. I don't know what time it is or where I really am. In fact I think they are taking me to hell, I'm sure of it, I ask them `are you taking me to hell?' `Yes' that's all they say and they are not smiling, not looking at me. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? Okay I'm going to hell I asked them forever? Yes was the response I got back. I'm cold, my leg hurts, my body feels numb, what happened? I lost my mind I remember, I can't look at them okay I'm going to hell you can't take me. I start shaking and hissing they should be scared out of their minds I'm not going easily.



I don't know how many times I was in and out of consciousness or what really happened or what I said but that's what was going on in my head and I'm pretty sure I wasn't nice to them because they aren't nice to me. When bits and pieces of memory started coming back I remembered not seeing anything with my actual eyes but I was a conscience, a soul, I envisioned a geometric rocket all the colors were soft pale yellows or off white and `we' the rockets were going around and around in a circle and implanted in my thoughts were the words forever, this is what I will be forever, this is what I will see forever, this is what I will hear forever, and I heard a constant whizzing sound that went off as if the rocket were whirring rapidly in a circle and I could hear it and that was all I heard.



I'm back in the ambulance again. I ask again where we are going, they say the name of the hospital, OMG WE CAN'T GO THERE I WORK THERE I'LL GET FIRED EVERYONE WILL KNOW. I beg them not to take a drug test the chemical I did is not illegal however I know I probably still have some lingering THC sticking to my fat cells from the last time I did smoke just to screw me over. I arrive in the ER approximately 10:30 right as I'm due to clock in for work, seeing all the faces of the people I work with, well THANK THE GOOD LORD I'VE ONLY HAD THIS JOB 3 WEEKS. No one really knew me yet. They tell me I had an opium overdose and I stabbed my upper left thigh about 2 inches into the muscle and need 7 stitches. I'm still lethargic I can't think straight what happened did A rat me out did she think I took her supply? No she got scared out of her mind because during that hour or so I lost control I stabbed myself, hissed at her, screamed and cried like a small mentally challenged child on her garage floor and she, a nurse in the same hospital I work, couldn't bring me back. She called 911, they busted her garage door down to get to me and yelled at her for even tampering with these dangerous chemicals which they confiscated. I fully came to complete awareness about 2 and a half hours after initial dose with scrapes, cuts, bruises and one angry, gnarly gash in my leg.



Bottom line\ldots 



If you're going to dabble with unknown substances please tread lightly and with caution. I am going to continue my research with these specific chemicals because I feel if used properly and under the correct mental and physical composure this can treat a variety of ailments and actually be a wonderful thing to enjoy. However you choose to use it just be sure to buckle your seat belt whether good or bad the experience you get will definitely be a ride you'll never forget.
