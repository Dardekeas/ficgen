Experienced with a variety of stimulents/empathogens, with perhaps a slightly higher tolerance than average (though it might be that I push it further, ie. I'm greedy). First time with this substance, so treading lightly.



Set: Had about half a bottle of wine (15\%alc) and feeling good. A few jitters of anticipation. Also consumed three pain killers approx three hours before for a tooth ache - contained paracetamol and codeine phosphate (36mg of the latter all up).



Setting: Late morning, with my brother in a comfortable environment.



I've heard good things about this substance when insufflated, so I tried this route first. Measured 86mg and separated into two roughly identical lines. Also measured a further 146mg and readied it in a gel cap.



00:00 Insufflated one line. It burned a little, but I was expecting that having read a few reports. It wasn't as bad as I'd braced myself for. 



T+00:01 Insufflated second line with other nostril. My eyes watered this time. I should point out here, that my nasal absorption rate seems low with cocaine, and that might carry over to this substance.



T+00:03 The taste has hit the back of my throat and my nose is running.



T+00:05 Ever so slightly off kilter. Feel slightly zonked, may be placebo.



T+00:09 Feel a noticable increase in the speed of my thought processes.



T+00:11 Was expecting more euphoria (imagining that it would hit pretty quickly with a nasal administration). Nostril burn still present though diminishing.



T+00:12 Notice a veering sensation, as if my mind is moving sideways without a corresponding movement from my body. Also notice that my toothache, which was coming back, has disappeared. Increased awareness of smell. 



T+00:14 Eyes constricted if anything at this point. 



T+00:15 Slight dizziness with a noticable shift in awareness. Feel slightly distanced from my physical self.



T+00:18 Urge to document this is quite strong. Loosening of the bowels. Thoughts are becoming clearer/sharper.



T+00:20 Nasal burn almost unnoticable now. Feeling comfortable at this stage. A relaxed stimulation. Still no euphoria or empathy.



T+00:22 Doing everything faster, not in a manic way, it feels normal and easy to move fast. I go have a shower.



T+00:28 Noticed an increase in tactile sensation whilst showering. Eyes are open wider that normal but still no dilation.



T+00:29 Not happy with my dose. No indication this will get any stronger. Will redose in ten minutes if no progression before then. Heart rate is faster though, definite CNS stimulation.



T+00:39 Decide to take the oral dose. I wash the 146mg gel cap down with a beer. Feeling a little disappointed with this substance at this stage. The early promise never seemed to eventuate. 



T+00:50 Finished beer. Taste was ok, and reasonably enjoyable. I'm not too inclined toward conversation at this point. 



T+01:12 Over the last few minutes I have noted a very good increase in euphoria and empathy. Feeling very nice. The skin on my forearms feels hot, but not uncomfortably so.



T+01:12-2:24 At this time I became incredibly engaged in free flowing conversation with my brother (who tells me my pupils are `f'ing enormous'). Though he hadn't taken any meph, he was as forthcoming in the conversation as I was (contact high?). The feeling was comparable to my first MDMA experience at a lower volume (I have a feeling this is only due to the low dose). Completely in control, but completely open at the same time. There was no topic too taboo. 



T+02:24 The come down is swift! I could actually feel it receding. It left me feeling a bit empty. One minute I'm as open and sociable as I've ever been, and the next I'm not far from my normal self. I was mindful of the many reports out there that claim fiending is a big part of the meph experience, so I consciously avoided any thoughts of redosing.



T+03:00 (approx) Still an underlying stimulation free of any `higher calibre' effects. The decline is enormously more gradual for the stimulative qualities, but this residual is such a paltry substitute for what has been and gone that I find it hardly worth my attention/enjoyment.



Summary: A very nice substance for me overall. My elocution was remarkably enhanced, communicative centers were gaping wide, very comfortable and relaxed stimulation, empathy was significant (even though the `magic' has long since departed my MDMA experiences). Comedown was not painful, just so swift it left a vacuum in its wake. I overindulged in MDMA when I was first introduced to it, and now I may as well have three caffeine drinks as take a pill. This substance feels (for me) like its effects could be similarly degraded with over-use. I'll be abstaining as much as my will permits.
