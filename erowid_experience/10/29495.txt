 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



Two nights ago, I was bored and so I decided to take a hit (maybe half lungs full) of a compressed air product used for blowing dust from computers. The chemical is difluoroethane. I had done this before, followed by the general effects of feelings of disconnection, pulsating sound hallucionations, etc. But the most prominent effect for me has been a strange tingling sensation when I touch things, or in general. It's difficult to explain. It's almost anasthetic like. After taking this hit, I got the regular effects. And then they eventually faded away and I felt normal again. So I stayed up a little while doing some stuff on the computer.



I hadn't done any since then, but the next night I went to the bathroom. I took a shit, and a few moments after leaving the bathroom, *bam* I got the sensation again, as though I had just taken another hit, even though I hadn't done it in 24 hours. This scared the shit out of me. It didn't make sense that I'd be affected by something that had worn off 24 hours ago. I didn't get it. To make matters worse, the sensation didn't go away. Several hours past, and I still felt `tingly.' I searched usenet and the usual forums for similar complications, and found none. I figured that I must have swallowed some of the gas into my stomach and going to the bathroom must have caused my body to abosrb it or something like that. So I decided to go to bed and hope that it was gone by morning.



The next day when I woke up (The day I post this), I still had the feeling. I continued to have the feeling for 7+ hours, even as I write this, although I don't notice it unless I grab something or sit down. I hope it will go away, although it could take several days since it hasn't gone away already. I hope it does go away.  I really hope it goes away, I am scared to think about it. The effect's intensity seems to have varied during the day. Sometimes it's not very noticeable, and other times it's very noticeable. I am worried that maybe I permanently damaged by brain or nervous system or something with this crap. I don't recommend using it. In fact, stay the fuck away from it. I know I will never touch the shit again.
