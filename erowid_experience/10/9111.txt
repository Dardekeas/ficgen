Over the summer I got tickets to see Trey Anastasio, the lead singer of Phish in concert. The day of the show I was pumped. I had never gotten to see Phish in concert and finnaly I would at least get to see Trey. When I arrived I headed straight to where all the action was in the lot.



Then I started seeing people coming out of the woods with balloons of Nitrous. So I headed over there to buy a ballon. Right when I was about to get my balloon, a cop yelled `What's going on over there!'. So the guy running the tank emptied it and threw it into the woods.



Luckily five minutes later they brought out another tank. I was one of the first ones in line this time so I happily took my balloon and sat down buy two chill guys selling burritos. I had never done nitrous before so I was really excited. Inhaled and held it for around 15 seconds then I exhaled. Right as I exhaled it hit me. It was amazing. Suddenly a whirring noise came on and kept becoming louder. It seemed I had lost a connection with the outside world though I never blacked out. The guy I was sitting next to me said `Are you enjoying this?' But his words came out all distorted and weird. This all lasted another 30 seconds before I was close to normal again. About a minute later I breathed in and out of the balloon again about five times. Suddenly I the noises started again and this lasted another minute. I still had a quarter of my balloon left after this so I decided to stand up, but as I got up my balloon popped. I was still a bit dazed when this happened so It took a minute for me to realize what had happened, but when I did I just started laughing hard. This was a great experience and I would really like to do this again.
