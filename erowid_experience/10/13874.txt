I purchased two bundles of dries poppy pods from a well Known

nursery and crafts store recently, and despite the poppy tea 

methods I've been reading about, it just doesn't appeal to me.

Where codeine extractions from acetamiophen products leaves little

alternative, poppy pods can be dealt with differently. I don't 

like wasting a useful substance\ldots  or puking, for that matter.



At least forty pods were crushed and dumped into an electric

fryer pot with enough water to `float' the matter freely.

Setting the dial never above the highest simmer level, I allowed

the mixture to heat for an hour or so, mixing periodically.



Next, I poured the contents through a strainer into a bowl and then

poured the cleaned liquid back into the fryer and let most of the

water content to simmer away until thick but still pourable.

I carefully poured the extract into a metal measuring cup and 

left it on one of those electric coffee cup warmers until it's

consistancy was gooey, like peanut butter. There was an adequate

amount of nicely dried `tar' around the surface edges of the

measuring cup to enjoy in a pipe right away. I placed the cup in

a cool place, away from light to let the heavy resin continue to

air-dry. 



A few good pipe hits at a time seems to pleasently relax me. 

I recommend the use of a small butane torch for maximum effects.
