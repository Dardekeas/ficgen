Pill Description

----------------

8mm round powder-blue pill. One side, stylized R. Other side, scored.

Above score, `053'. Purported to be diazepam. Owing to the blue color, I

guess that it is probably 10mg, as this is the color scheme that

non-generic Valium uses. [Erowid Note : According to the Drug Identification Bible, this is a generic 10mg diazepam pill produced by Purepac Pharmaceutical]



1:50AM

------

I ingest the pill. We had a snowstorm today, and I had ingested some DPT

earlier in the evening to go play in the foot deep snow (the first real

snowstorm in over 3 years), but it has long since worn off. I also smoked

a little pot earlier, but it has mostly worn off as well. I am more or

less at baseline.



2:20AM

------

I begin to feel a little different. It's been a long time since I've had

any benzodiazepines, but this does feel like what I remember. The main

distinctions between the various benzodiazepines are in duration and

intensity. Qualitatively they are all more or less the same. As far as

comparison to other depressants, it is most similar to GHB, but definitely

not the same. It's even less similar to alcohol, and only vaguely similar 

to the narcotics. I will base most of my comparisons on GHB, that being

the depressant I'm most familiar with. Diazepam is supposed to take about

an hour to reach peak effect, so it's still too early to really describe

it, or compare it to anything else. Initially, it seems as if there is

more of a calming effect, but less of a euphoric effect than GHB. The

physical sensations are somewhat different as well. There is more of a

feeling of muscle relaxation than GHB produces, and the ecstasy-like 

tactile enhancements of GHB are pretty much absent from the diazepam

experience. The come-on is alot more gradual. I'm at T+0:30 now, and its 

just beginning to take effect. I'll give it some more time.



2:50AM

------

Well, I'm now at T+1:00, and I'm feeling the diazepam pretty well\ldots  tho

from what I've read, it can take from 1-2 hours for peak plasma levels.

And I didn't have an empty stomach, so I'm sure I haven't reached the peak

effect yet. I can feel it gradually increasing still, in fact. I'm a good

deal more intoxicated than I was a half hour ago, but alot of my original

assessments hold. Compared to GHB, this is a milder intoxication, in some

ways. The muscle relaxation is alot stronger than with GHB. The sensation

is similar to having just stepped out of a hot bath or sauna - totally

relaxed muscles, a jello-like body feeling. There is much more of an urge

to close the eyes than I get on GHB, though I don't feel sleepy at all.

As I said earlier, this is much more of a calming, relaxing feel than the

euphoric high of GHB. There is a touch of the strobe-like dizzy visual

effect that I sometimes get from high doses of GHB, but it is much more

subdued. I am listening to music through headphones\ldots  diazepam seems much

more conducive to music appreciation than GHB. I keep getting drawn to lie

down and just relax and absorb the music.



3:10AM

------

I'm at T+1:20 now. I think I've hit the peak effects. Diazepam seems to be

more of a dumbing high than GHB\ldots  I find myself closing my eyes and just

listening to music and and feeling the physical sensations, there is alot

less noise in my mind than usual. Less thoughts flying back and forth.

This is much more noticable than on GHB. I am feel as if sleep would be

easy and pleasant at this point, but its not the irresistable passing out

that GHB can cause. Putting on some more uptempo music dramatically

increases my energy level, and vanquishes all thoughts of sleep. I feel

very mellow and relaxed. I have a pleasant body high which is similar to

GHB, yet distinct. More relaxed, less tingly. When I get up to walk

around, I stagger a little\ldots  unlike alcohol and GHB though, this stagger

doesn't seem to be due to dizziness or a loss of equilibrium, but rather

due to the fact that my leg muscles are very relaxed, and my legs feel a

little jello-like, sort of like if I had excersized them a great deal

earlier. My whole body in fact is sort of slumped and very relaxed. None

of my muscles seem to have any tension.



3:25AM

------

Still about the same place, but I feel myself yawning a little now. Not

really tired at all though. I decide to smoke some marijuana at 3:35, or

T+1:45.



3:35AM

------

I went outside and filled a juice glass full of loose snow. I spooned this

snow into my bong, and loaded a hit into the bowl. I take a hit\ldots  the icy

cold condensed smoke goes down smoothly and expands in my lungs.

Immediately I feel a significant boost in the effects of the diazepam\ldots 

though it has changed slightly from the THC now in my system. Considering

the date and realizing that this snow storm is probably my last

opportunity to take snow-bongs at least until next winter, I load another

hit and suck it down. I cough pretty hard\ldots  Well, one more just for good

luck! I feel pretty high now\ldots  I'll give it a few minutes to settle in,

then describe it.



3:50AM

------

T+2:00 and feelin' groovy! I predominantly feel diazepam, but its now

strongly colored by the pot. The mild shaky visual effect I noticed

earlier is now noticably stronger, approaching the levels I'd expect from

alcohol\ldots  I *feel* much more lucid than I would on GHB or alcohol\ldots   But

this is illusion. I'm clear headed, but *too* clear headed. There are far

fewer verbal thoughts running through my mind than normal. But there is no

feeling of confusion or disorientation. It is not a loss of coherence,

just a drastic slowing of pace.



4:20AM

------

I take a puff, of course\ldots  I still feel about the same, and I think this

report can be wound up now. It's T+2:30. Thinking about the diazepam and

how the night has gone, it looks like its two primary actions seem to be

as an anxiolytic and a muscle relaxer. There is a mild euphoria, but alot

less than from GHB or alcohol - its more a feeling of relaxation than

anything else. Granted I am alone right now, but this still feels much

less of a social drug than GHB or alcohol, too - this is something I'd

like to take by myself and lay in a hammock or on the beach. Not a party

drug. I've enjoyed benzodiazepines every time I've done them, and find

them far superior to alcohol. They're not something I enjoy enough to

seek them out, but they're a nice treat when they come into my hands. I'm

sure I will sleep well tonight!
