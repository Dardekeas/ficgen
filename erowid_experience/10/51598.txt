 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



This was about 6 months ago, I went into my shed and sat on the floor with a red can of gasoline (about half full). I wiped off the nozzle, opened the breather on the other end and started breathing heavily. `This is awesome!' I thought as I starting hearing `The Noise' similar to a `wah wah wah' sound.  My body became extremely relaxed and I started having deep thoughts about how I was destined to do this and that the gas was a part of me. 



I felt that each little molecule of the gas was an individual that needed me to set them free. I did set them free by inhaling them. Huffing gas is great but the results are not. All I cared about was getting in touch with my gasoline buddies inside the red gas can, and it made me very depressed. I dropped out of school because it was interrupting my huffing. I kept huffing for four months, practically if I was awake I was in my shed with my red can of friends, and when I slept I dreamt of them. 



I finally decided to stop huffing when I got a job. About 12 hours after I put down the can (the actual high last about 5 minutes but after huffing heavily for more than an hour, makes it so that after I stop the effects are still there but about 1/2 as intense for about 6 hours) It was the honest to god the first time in four months that I was completely sober. At that instant I realized the damage. My mind was very clouded (thought it was temporary but still the same to this day) I couldn't read half as good as before, I got very frustrated is said out loud `why was I so stupid!' I was completely shocked at my speaking. I slurred words so bad that I could hardly understand my self. I also stuttered heavily (never stuttered in my life until this). I couldnt retain any new information, I had almost zero short term memory. I'm getting better though (2 months since I quit) I don't stutter, I still slur words occasionally. But my mind still remains clouded.
