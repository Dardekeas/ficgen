Well, it was a birthday present to the person I was with, and no one there at the party had ever tried it before. No one knew what it would do to us - and I was concerned becuase I had done what, for me, was a lot of coke, which was not actually a lot at all - but I am not a regular user and have no tolerance. 



We both did VERY SMALL lines and sat back to see what it would do.

It comes on relatively quickly, and no trepidation. Things just start to become more vivid and interesting, and brighter, and you do too\ldots 

at first I was very relaxed and layed down, realizing how high I was. VERY. After about 15 minutes.  Body high - not visual, but sensual and stimulating. Then a beautiful french girl that everyone was intimidated by came over to check on me and I told her `Je besoin de beaucoup de practice avec mon fracais - mon vocabulaire ce'st merde, y les numeros me confuse completment' - which is damn good french for me - and it was on. 



She made me dance with her and I have never felt so wonderful in my life. Well, maybe - but it was truly transformational. I love to dance and do it to engage in physical release and have reached spiritual levels with it - but this was unprecedented. 



Not only was I bonded to this girl emotionally - the fact that we were using our bodies to communicate to music was absolutely transcendent. Everyone watching us - no self-concsciousness - only bliss. joy. My body naturally engaging in spontaneous art, performace, and communication. The boys said we looked completely hot - they were riveted. They asked me what it felt like and I announced proudly that I felt like `A Porn Star with Magic Powers' - and I was. 



And I guess I am.



Completely comfortable with my sexual power in a healthy and positive way. 

Some drugs that make you feel sexy will make people do things that they regret later - engaging in intimacy with people that at the time seems meaningful - later a let down. risky behavior. When this same stunning girl came onto me later (I swear to god - she showed me a dildo in her backpack and said `I want sex - come downstairs with me' I did not go.) I was looking forward to a real friendship with her - possibly turning into the third my male partner and I had been `sort of' shopping for - but was not tempted to rush things just because I felt so sexy.



Anyone who really understands sex can tell you that it is far more than physical - and sexy as I felt - I had the wherewithall to get her number and save such a potentially amazing thing for a more intimate and controlled setting. 



I never got the chance - as she was just high too and never came on to me again- but I do not regret the choice I made.  Our friendship continued.



I would happily do the stuff again in a minute - perfect for social occasions. I felt like talking to everyone- about interesting things. I hear overdosage is easy and fatal - so a carefully measured dose is critical. don't take it lightly.



Foxy is a perfect name for it. Perfect. Unless we start calling it `magic foxy'. I felt my own power in a positive and loving way - and it ruled.
