At a legal rave with my girlfirend, industrial outskirts of the town. The two rooms were quite crowded as it was raining outside. The lower one had some techno, while in the upper one they were playing goa trance. We bought the acid from a gabber kid, two Shiva imprint blotters (those were around in that period and knew that were something like 80-100 micrograms) and shared the first one. After one hour of very mild tripping (laughs and sociophylosophical conversation) we wanted to dance so we ate the other hit and went searching for some mdma, which was basically not available. 



In the goa room we found a girl claiming to have mdma tablets, but they were bigger than usual, white, very crumbly and had a distinctive fishy smell (the logo was a dolphin, too). I said to her that in my opinion that was mephedrone and she admitted it and made a better price for two pills, which we ate immediately.



After half an hour the thing set up with mild rushes of energy, a distinctive but not strong entactogenic effect (feeling affectionate, kissing, etc), which went up and down for like 2 hours in three or four little peaks. There was no sense of general, global `goodness' like with mdma, neither the energy rush was too intense. We danced for a while, supported more by the acid, which, when the mephedrone effect faded, came on very strongly and accompanied us home for some six hours with very strong closed eye visuals and bizarre dimensional shift feelings. The candyflip effect was not really there, so it looked like mephedrone did not have the strong LSD interlace ability that mdma has.
