I like to experiment with plants every now and then. I was doing a little research on homeopathy (holistics) and decided to try `mulungu' for its sedative properties (I suffer from insomnia). 



So I got 3 leaves and a piece of bark of `mulungu' from the garden, and headed into the kitchen. I washed then sliced the leaves so that the internals would be exposed (not sure if makes any difference though) and placed them in a pot with about 1 liter of water, along with the bark. I let it sit for 10 mins. Then put the pot on the stove (at med temp.). I let it boil (at low temp.) for about an hour. The water had aquired a green color.



There was a little less than a full cup left. I poured the liquid into a cup and expecting a terrible taste, closed my nose and gulped it down. No bad taste, not pleasent either. I felt a puckering sensation in my mouth. 



I then went to watch some tv, not feeling anything yet. I'm not quite sure how long went by but before I knew it was knocked out. I entered dreamland, filled with comfort and ease (wish I could describe the dreams but an hour after I woke up I had forgotten most of my dreams, but I know they were very pleasent). about 8 hours later I woke up from dreamland. Feeling incredibly relaxed I stood up (whoa\ldots  not a good idea) and fell on my ass. I had no sense of balance whatsoever. So I sat back down on the couch and relaxed for a little bit more. about 30 minutes later I tried to stand up again. To my surprise I was absolutely `normal', as if I had never tried the mulungu infusion, except for that warm, fuzzy, comfy sensation, which remained for 2 more days.



I really enjoyed my experience with this plant. I hope my experience will be of some use.
