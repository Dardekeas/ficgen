I was scared as hell at first. I didn't know what to expect, I guess. I never felt this hesitation in all my psychonaut experiences until the day my friend Brad showed up at my doorstep at three in the afternoon with a gram of uncut meth. A day before I had mentioned wanting to try some, but just a little, because I loved the hyped-up feeling of Acid but had had bad experiences with ephedrine and ephedra in the past. Now, here, in my apartment sat Brad, some other friends, myself and a gram of pure crystal.



He gave me a pretty big bump, I thought. Well, it looked big, at least. I snorted it after about three minutes of talking myself into it. I had heard a lot of bad stuff about meth, but I just had to try it for myself.



Time passed and everyone left my house about twenty minutes after I had snorted the line. It didn't burn my sinuses like I thought it would, but it didn't numb everything like coke does either. The drainage down the back of my throat was kind of pleasant, but it didn't have that `coke' taste to it.



When it began to kick in, I realized why they call it `speed' real damn quick. I was a little impressed, however I was getting bored. The drainage down my throat was making me nauseated so I decided to smoke some weed. Problem solved. The one thing that caught my attention is that I'd lose the buzz if I didn't stay busy. I had to keep moving.



Well\ldots . My apartment was messy (but not too messy, mind you), and so I decided to clean it. Funny thing is, I have a small studio apartment, and I probably spent 4 hours cleaning it just because it was too damn hot to go outside and do anything. There is only one word to describe my place after I came down: Spotless. 



I'd do it again, I think. It's at least one hell of a way to have fun while cleaning and doing other dirty work.
