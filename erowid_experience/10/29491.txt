I had never tried Somas before, only heard tales of this mysterious drug.  I stumbled upon a full bottle of the 350mg pills when my friend complained to my dad of a soar hand.  He had punched something and broke it the night before while he was extremely intoxicated.  So I get the bottle, come online and type in `CARISOPRODOL', to learn more about the drug.  Seemed very Codiene like so I popped about 4 of them at noon.  After a little while I felt nothing, so out of frusteration I popped 4 more at 12:30 and my friends and I decided to go to the hot tub at my grandfathers country club.  That's where my memory of that whole day ends.



We didn't have a key to get in, so we broke in and upon entering the hot tub there was 2 cops watching us in the hot tub\ldots  we were so fucking out of it that we didn't even know and carried on with our business.  I was incoherient and the cop asked me how we got in here and I just remember telling him that I didn't want to talk to him because I was very `tired'.  Somehow, the cop got my moms phone \# out of me or one of my friends and called her and told her that I was unconcious in the country club hot tub.  She told him to send my ass home ASAP.



So my buddy drove us all home (I guess?) and I got carried into my house and my mom told me I face planted in the garage and it was scary to see me so wasted.  I passed out for several hours, word is I was foaming at the mouth.  I slept it off, never seeked any medical treatment and woke up around 8:00pm or so and began walking around my house blindly.  I knew I had to pick my girlfriend up from the air port so I got in the car and went.   \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#   The lines on the road were blurring\ldots  it was like I was tripping.  The lines kept twisting into each other and I kept swirving all over the place, it was crazy.



To say the least I didn't really have a pleasurable experience with this drug.  It's like 3 days later and I still feel all groggy and weak\ldots  I think due to the overdose.  Later.
