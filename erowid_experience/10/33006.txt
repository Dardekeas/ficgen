I had quite a bizzare experience today from chewing a rather large amount of copenhagen brand tobacco snuff.



First of all, the drugs I have tried in the past include:

Whippets

Marijuana

Alcohol

Painkillers

DXM

Caffeine

Cocaine

Heroin

Morning glory seeds

And Nutmeg



Im not a big fan of cigarettes (mostly because I have a 5 minute coughing attack when I try to inhale the smoke). Anyway, the other day my friend offered me some tobbacco snuff, I figured `why the hell not?' so in my ignorance I snorted a small line of it (ouch). My friend then informed me that `your supposed to put it in your mouth dumbass' I chewed a bit of it and enjoyed the pleasant lightheadedness. My friend gave me the rest of the snuff and I went home. 



Later that day I thought to myself: `Hmmmmm\ldots . I bet if I put a HUGE chunk in my mouth I'll get REALLY buzzed!' (I know I'm stupid) so I stuffed a large quantity between my lips and gums and started sucking, I started swallowing my spit instead of spitting it out assuming that I would absorb more nicotine that way. After a few minutes I started getting that lightheaded feeling but it came on faster and was MUCH more strong it was like that headrush feeling I get when my car goes down a steep hill too fast. It was absolultly unpleasant in every way. I also started getting a horrible throbbing headache and some slight nausea. It was like the feeling I get from holding my breath for a really really long time. I started getting paranoid thoughts like I was going to pass out and choke to death on my own puke. I finally said enough is enough and spit it all out and washed my mouth out. Then I splashed some water on my face and layed down. The feeling faded within a few minutes but I was left with the unpleasant headache for the remainder of the night.



It wasn't THAT bad of an experience but it just goes to show that you must have respect for ALL psychoactives even if you think its just something mild and harmless.



Will I ever do snuff again? Yeah, probably

Will I ever do THAT much again? Hell no
