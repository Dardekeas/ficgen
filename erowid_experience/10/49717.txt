I've got mild tinnitus from nitrous use.



I've been experimenting with nitrous oxide in whippet form off and on for appx. 6 months.  I more frequently use cannabis and alcohol, and I've dabbled in other things as well.  I have read nearly everything available online about nitrous usage and began to wonder what exactly was `too much.'  Usually, the health concerns were written of in conjunction with individuals who had used pure nitrous from a tank w/o enough oxygen, or who were doing a box or two daily for a period of months.  As I'd experienced no ill effects after the occassional box once every couple weeks, I'd become less concerned about the amounts.  



Eventually I was doing a box a week, and this lasted for 4 weeks.  Over the period of the final week, I split five 24 cartridge boxes with a friend, and in one ten hour sitting inhaled appx. 45 cartridges while drinking beer.  Since only one online report that I found mentioned tinnitus, and that was only in passing and w/o specified dose amounts, I felt I should offer this for anyone wondering about real side-effects of what I consider to be short-term whippet use.  I am only experiencing a low-level ringing, and it isn't enough to disrupt my day-to-day activities, but it has been persistent for two days, with no change.  I believe that this is a result of pressure in the ears from the mechanics of balloon inhalation/exhalation, not necessarily the gas itself.  However, I'm not a doctor.  I assume it will pass, but right now I just accept it and have no more interest in nitrous.    



Although I question its relevance in this case, I had also eaten ginseng and have been on venlafaxine for a few years.
