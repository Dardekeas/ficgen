I bought a 5 gram bag of this stuff off the internet.  I don't smoke, so tea was the method of ingestion.  I tried several infusions of the herb, but the strongest effects I got were actually from the first whiff of the herb, which seemed to open all my senses and invigorate my mind.



I did find that the herb allowed me to imagine very vividly, but only when I didn't try.  If I just emptied my mind, I would find fascinating trains of thought, but the process was so delicate that as soon as I got excitated or tried to pursue the thought, it would slip away to my frustration. The most vivid experience was the first night, I was drifting a bit, and started thinking of mushrooms, suddenly before my eyes was a beautiful landscape of vivid colours and a large spotted mushroom with little ones surrounding it.  There were oranges and purples everywhere, but only for an instant, for I snapped out of it when I tried to go deeper.  Dreams were no more lucid than normal.  (People need to look up the definition of `lucid' before getting too excited over this.  It would only be really beneficial to people who never remember their dreams or act in them I think.  Mine are always in color and memorable anyway.) 



Overall, a frustrating experience that was slightly cool, but not worth the bitter taste and anxiety of not being able to touch the experience.
