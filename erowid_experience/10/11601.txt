[Erowid Note: 1.8 gram+ of caffeine is considered an extremely high dose, see Caffeine Dose Chart]





A summer a few years ago - during one of my summer breaks from school - I spent the night up in front of my computer, while consuming caffeine pills I acquired at my local pharmacy. I at a few pills, two or three, once every 4 hours. I didn't quite get no kick or anything, but I acquired the sense of well-being and increased creativity that a few cups of coffee gives you once in a while.





However; when the sun finally rose I thought `what-the-hell' and threw about 18 caffeine pills (100mg each) into my mouth. I tell you; these pills taste like shit! and eventually I managed to swallow them all. The taste, however, stayed in my mouth until I washed it down with a fresh glass of cola.





I sat in front of my computer for about 30 more minutes, and then I decided to go for a walk. When I went outside in the fresh air, I felt kind of tired, but as I kept walking the sleepy feeling turned into a nauseous feeling. And I kept feeling very nauseous for the following 3 hours. Every single step I took made me want to throw up, and every single breath I took felt uncomfortable. I went indoors again and decided to watch TV for a while. But as I slacked in my sofa, the nauseous feeling turned in to deep anxiety.





When these three hours had passed, the anxiety disappeared and was replaced by light euphoria and I felt a mood lift. My impressions of music was enhanced, everything sounded louder, clearer - more intense. I was really alert as well, my mind was running in the top gear. The effect didn't go away until late next afternoon.
