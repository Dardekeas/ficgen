Since yesterday was my last day of school, I was really bored. So, I called up a friend and asked him if he had some Vicodin or anything else for me. I was half joking when I said this because I didn't really expect him to come over. Well, about an hour later, the guy shows up at my house with 50mg of Cyclobenzaprine and 2 very large tablets of Vicodin.



We dicked around for a while, and I finally told him I didn't have any money for the Vicodin. He told me it was all good, he would save them for later when I got some cash, so he gave me three 10mg tabs of Cyclobenzaprine and said something to the effect of `Two of these will make you really relaxed and sleepy.' He told me he had previously took 3 of them and could not even walk straight and all he could do was just sleep. Well, since he is about 350 pounds, I figured this must be good shit.



So, I bag the 30mg of Cyclobenzaprine, and as soon as he leaves I go straight to the web to look it up, although I had no idea what it was named, but the appearance and number on the tabs.



So, after looking this shit up, I see it's a muscle relaxant, sedative, etc.



I decide to down all 3 of them. Now, I had just eaten a burger, fries, and some fucking ice cream, so this was on a full stomach.



I took them at 8:26 PM.



T+0:05: No effect. This lasted until about 9:15 or 9:30, at which point they started to kick in. I was at a friend's house and just sat there staring at the wall, unable to do anything else, almost like a trance. I fall over on the suddenly very comfortable carpet and begin to drool and stare into the wall. My entire body feels numb.



I go to another buddies house after this (about 20 minutes after I first fell on the floor and went numb), and we tried to do some stuff, but I just kept saying how tired I was and how numb I felt.



We went to sleep pretty early (a few hours after I had taken them) and it was the best sleep of my life. Even when I was forcefully awoken, my entire body was just one huge numb being, staring at whatever was in front of me.



I will definitely do this shit again sometime soon. Especially if I want to relax a bit.
