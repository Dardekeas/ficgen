It was an ordinary day and i was quite bored as usuall. The mail truck came and left me with one 21 inch cactus and 100 seeds. I placed the cactus in my closet. I've never had a psychedelic experience, but something within me has been telling me that I should try it. For a few years now I was depressed, my mother knew this and was thinking I should go to a psychiatrist. I knew from all that I have read and learned that I could be my own psychiatrist with psychedelics. I have been learning about them for about three deeply devoted years, and was one of the few people that do their homework before using such a powerful substance. From all that I read and learned I was sure that I could handle the experience quite easily. 



Before the catus arrived I read somewhere that San Pedro wasn't potent and that you need to eat a few pounds just to have a decent experience. This got me upset as I proceeded to take the spines off the cactus in my room. I was expecting to have something like a potent weed high and nothing more. I partialy peeled the cactus and put the remains in a blender and liquified it. I spooned in the sludge into my mouth trying to swallow it down as quick as possible so that I wouldn't have to taste much. after a few spoonfuls I had to pinch my leg while swallowing to prevent from gagging myself. 



I finished the sludge and layed down and listened to some dance music. After an hour I got bored and went to my PC. I stayed on the computer for around a half hour and thought I had just wasted my time buying and eating this cactus. I didn't feel or see anything so decided to go to bed. I turned on my blacklight and tried to go to sleep. I layed in bed and couldn't go to sleep, so I turned to face the cieling and noticed that I felt somewhat humble and happy just to be lying in my bed in my pj's. I looked at the cieling and noticed small distortions in my vision, sort of like a pot visual. I entertained myself with this for around an hour. 



I thought I had reached my peak when the cieling looked like it was flowing like water. But then the visuals came on stronger and stronger. I felt somewhat drunk or stoned not really mind revealing. Then as the visuals began to overwhelm me, I started getting nervous and a little scared. I thought to myself while I was feeling drunk or stoned that this wasn't spiritual and I dissed the many people that said that the experience was powerful and revealing. I felt that the visuals were letting me know that I had disrespected them and the ancient shamans. I started apoligizing and said that I would treat this with much more respect from now on. 



My thoughts were merging with what I was feeling and became part of my reality. I was starting to panic and feeling nauses and dizzy. Then I thought to myself what I had read and began saying out loud `RELAXATION IS THE GATEWAY', while inhaling deep and exhaling (sort of like some kind of meditating breathing exercise). I kept doing this as the room was bieng overwhelmed with strong warping images and distortions of objects around the room. I did this for a short while and then it JUST HIT! I felt what I was saying and I came to the conclusion that fear here\ldots has no meaning! I felt as though I had been freed from the panic and fear. 



That is when the experience showed me the doors of perception and I closed my eyes and saw animals, plants and people like those sewn into indian carpets and art, all in deep bluish colors and some becoming super intricate and colorful. I had the cd player in my radio playing some guitar music, and it sounded so clear, as if I could play the guitar! There were some warping worm holes that would expand and as I focused into them I would go into deep thought trances and everything in existence though infinetley complicated became so clear and simple. 



I could focus into many thoughts and I felt that I should focus on a basic thought so that I could remember when I returned into normal counciousness. The basic principal of the experience is' EVERYTHING EXISTS WITHIN ITSELF' MEANING: all of reality is so basic yet so infinite. Think about space, the universe \ldots  the galaxies exist within it and the solar systems exist within that\ldots . planets exist in that\ldots . living animals exist within the earth bacteria and cells live within the animals and atoms exist within that\ldots .EVERYTHING EXISTS IN AN ETERNAL PLANE. I could see everything as eternal. 



So beautiful and so simple. I have never experienced such a strong sense of peace with living and existing. The next day I went outside and noticed things like birds singing and the wind steadily blowing, everything became so beautiful and I had a change of life views and was no longer jealous about what other people had. I lost my anger that was deep inside of me\ldots  and it feels GREAT!
