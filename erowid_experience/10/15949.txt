It was a long hard day and all I wanted was to chill and play some computer games. The only drug I had in the house that gave the warning about drowsiness was these things called lorazepam. It wasn't mine, so I figured that since it said `do not exceed 2 tablets daily' that 3 would be good for me. I ground it up in to a powder and poured it in to a glass with cola. It fizzed lots, I think it was just the filler in the pill reacting with the acidic cola. 



It made it go down alot smoother, so I chugged the whole thing back and started playing a game on the computer. About half an hour later I felt nothing but tired (it was around 1 am and I had worked all day). I had a desk lamp right next to me and I glanced at it, and it appeared to look away, like when someone is staring at you and when you look at them they try to make it seem as though they were not. I though, ok whatever, it was nothing. 



Awhile later my computer looked like it was coming off the shelf, as I looked at it it stopped but then my bed looked like it was made of jello. I found this to be quite odd as the pills were just antidepressants. I decided the next day that I would go up to my buddies and verify what happened. We both took 5 mg. It was quite fucked up again. I was staring at a south park poster and it looked like they guys were walking around and waving at me. I was staring at his ceiling and it looked like it was the shore of a lake, filled with tiny pieces of different coloured styrofoam. When we were walking in the streets it appeared that the street lights were nodding their heads at me as a greeting which I returned with a friendly `hello'. 



I didn't feel intoxicated, I could tell that everything I was seeing wasn't real, but my other friends knew I was on something just from the way I was walking and talking. When we got back to his house I was sitting on his bed with head phones on, staring at myself in the mirror on his dresser. After a while my *reflection* started nodding its head up and down, whereas I was not. It then started moving its lips like it was talknig really fast, again I was not. The dresser began to float and I decided that was enough for the night and that I would go to sleep.



I have concluded that these pills work in conjunction with deprivation of sleep, it seems the longer I stayed up, the more intense things got. Also I talked to a guy I know and this one time he was on a coke binge and wanted something to help him when he was coming down and he took those. He said the end of his needle turned in to some kind of worm, that was different colours and had millions of legs. He verified that it did not happen til the lorazepam kicked in. Obviously he was really over tired. 



In the end these pills might be good if mixed with something else like pot, I didn't mind it but I didn't get too much of a buzz, I just saw stuff.
