I recently purchased some Blue Lotus 15x extract from an online supplier  in search of a pain-therapy alternative to marijuana. 



My package arrived on time via USPS parcel, and I hurried home and into my room for a look. First off, this stuff looks better than any other `legal' opiates I have bought online such as the Mexican Prickly Poppy which turned out to be bunk as hell. 



Secondly, just the smell and the green oil associated with this black hard gunk made me start to think, `Hey, I might just have something here.' And lastly, the taste is something like a blast from the past like we have all smoked this stuff before (maybe it's just my own reality created through the deja vu I get daily around my present group of friends). 



The smell and taste is sweet like a Blue flower would be expected to be. Very attractive. However, to achieve full potential of this flower (which I have only smoked it) is difficult because my pipe eventually gets to hot to smoke out of. And when it comes to me and entheogens I always prefer smoking them first instead of oral dosing because of the time duration being much shorter usually via smoking. 



So I have still not drank it, but I will eventually. I am out right now and waiting for the next order. 



However, smoking is very mild and pleasant. I cant say it would ever replace pot because of marijuanas psychological addictive qualities, but it makes me not miss real morphine as much. A lot funner than crushing pills and putting them up my nose anyways. 



I like to smoke about 1/4 of a gram at a sitting to myself. It is fun also sharing with friends, but again, my smoking utensil usually gets too hot to fast. After a while, it can get slightly difficult to even relight my lighter, or hold the pipe up.  



The effects are quite subtle, mellow and numbing. And absolutely no side effects except sleep of course. I recently had found myself in a phase of insomnia in my life and this was truly a cure-all, or at least I would sleep four to six hours instead of not at all. 

So medicinally, on a scale of 1 to 10 for the price and ease of use via smoking, I would give it an 8. I am sure if I got the balls to finally drink some mixed with water or alcohol I would rate it a 10. 



Hell, I even mix it with pot to find a nice synergy there. Not bad, not bad.
