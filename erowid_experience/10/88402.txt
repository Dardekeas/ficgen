So on my Birthday I took roughly 40mg worth (eyeballed).



Timeline is sketchy at best because while I could see the numbers on my clock and tell the time, keeping track of it was impossible.



4-AcO-DMT appereance - white powder, slightly grainy sandy texture that is more like salt and less like flour. To compare it to JWH-018 - 4-AcO-DMT is salt-like, JWH-018 is flour or powdered-sugar-like.



Anyways\ldots 



4-AcO-DMT is a hell of a drug. I think I experienced something profound, but I'm just not smart enough to comprehend what its all about. I did get a lot out of the experience though, not sure what its all worth in the long run but it was all definitely very interesting. 



Mind-Set: Happy, its my birthday, not expecting much but hoping its going to be a good day. Maybe a little anxious because my sister was coming over sometime randomly in the day, and I didn't want her to bust in mid-trip (she did).



Setting: My house, everyone's home - mom/dad/brother/dog. I'm in the living room by myself watching TV.



Anyways, on with the experience.



Time starts at 12:00pm noon.



0:00 - Ingest $\sim$30mg using a tiny piece of toilet paper as a parachute. Its loosely wrapped to help it hit faster. Washed down with orange juice.

 

0:01 - Said fuck it and put another tiny little bump onto another small square and ate it\ldots  I hoped it wasn't too late and that they would still digest together. Washed down with more orange juice.



0:10 - Jolt of energy in my spine/brain\ldots  I notice that my glass of orange juice is really orange\ldots  not sure if it was the lighting or the 4-aco taking effect, but it was really nice looking.



0:20 - I looked at myself in the mirror and laughed\ldots  then I was like `What the fuck, why did I just laugh?'. I feel giddy, like a kid on Christmas eve staying up late. I keep looking at random shit and getting giggle fits\ldots  very unusual for me.



0:30 - I can definitely feel it now. Everything is pretty much the same, but I can see mild fractal patterns on the wall\ldots  oddly enough, white surfaces gave off the most fractal patterns. I was disappointed with how non-colorful this substance is\ldots  it basically takes the image you are looking at and makes it fractalized, doesn't really change its colors. I decided to go downstairs to smoke 2 or 3 bowls of weed out of my gravity bong. I realized I made a mistake shortly afterwards. I go back upstairs and watch TV, I was watching Tom and Jerry: Blast off to Mars\ldots  and about 5 minutes went by and I could feel my brain taking off like a rocket ship. The cartoon was just too much so I went to my room and laid down in my bed.



0:60 - Tripping balls, but still not a very colorful experience. I closed my eyes for a second and saw a neon monkey face. The design looked very ancient, yet oddly modern due to the neon-colors. I felt as though I just saw the missing link in our evolution\ldots  but its just a passing though. I also see infinite mountains of skulls\ldots  I realize they are the skulls of our ancestors, and that if we stacked all of their their skulls up we could build a fairly large mountain. I have no idea what the significance of these thoughts are/were, I just know I had them. I get out of bed and try playing a game of darts, I manage to hit the board with all 3 darts, but I feel no achievement\ldots  I feel more confused than anything.



1:30 - Tripping even harder now\ldots  I am starting to wish this shit would just wear off and that I hope I'm not stuck like this. I keep telling myself `this is just a drug, its going to wear off in about an hour or two.' I start having profound insights into the workings of the universe, and about human existence\ldots  well at least during the trip these thoughts shook me pretty hard. I was thinking things like `The point of human existence is understanding.' \ldots   In general though things were coming and going so fast it was hard to grasp most of it.



2:00 - Fuck this stuff is powerful. I can see the synapses and neurons of my brain firing. I turn on the radio and it scares me for some reason. It is just an audio clusterfuck with the pop-music and commercials and static between stations\ldots  it was overwhelmingly negative so I had to turn it off and cheer myself up. I decided to go take a shower, I'm tripping so hard I have a hard time figuring out the locks on my bedroom door. I stumble into the bathroom and look in the mirror and I have no irises. My face was all angular and harsh looking. I had a brief moment where I realized I really am not that good looking. It felt good to be honest with myself about it. Anyways, I hopped into the shower, but found standing and operating soap and shampoo and being on a slick surface really felt unsafe, so I decided to take a bath instead. 



2:20 -I get half way through my bath and my sister comes bounding in the house with my niece and she pounds on the bathroom door so hard it felt like my head exploded like an M-80 in a watermelon. I am in shell-shock due to the sudden and obnoxious pounding of the door. She wants me to come out and see my niece and I'm mid-trip and mid-shower. I struggle to shampoo/condition my hair\ldots  it all felt so unnatural and awkward. I hop out and brushed my teeth, the toothpaste was really minty and it confused my mouth\ldots  I felt like I was still brushing my teeth even after I stopped and put my toothbrush away.



2:30 - I struggle to get dressed\ldots  I am fully aware that going out of the bathroom door while naked will result in a bad experience, so I force myself to deal with the confusion and put my clothes on properly, I even managed to brush my hair and I looked passable. I am deeply satisfied with this accomplishment\ldots  I decide to not tell anyone that I'm tripping to see if I can just ride it out without anyone even knowing it happened.



2:45 - I think I'm coming down\ldots  there is less DMT-like fractal patterning and mind-fucking and more of a weed/beer like buzz. I'm playing with my niece and she has this glow/aura around her\ldots  she looks magical and enchanted with all the happiness/innocence in the world. I managed to teach her what her eyes were and she even pointed to my eye (poked me). I felt a great thrill from teaching her something that she'll have for the rest of her life. I had a brief moment where I contemplated becoming a teacher\ldots . but then laughed, knowing how bad I did in school and how much I swear/cuss/say off-the-wall shit.



3:00 - Still very mild fractal patterning on my ceiling if I stare `hard' enough\ldots  basically like magic-eye.



4:00 - Definitely wore off by now\ldots  I can't feel anything, my pupils are still dilated but I feel totally normal, if a little bit mystified. I have an odd sensation in my balls/taint area, like at the very end of my spinal cord\ldots  it feels like my taint is being squeezed a little bit and like my taint weighs like 20 pounds. I checked for a tumor/whatever, but I know for a fact I didn't feel it before the trip, but now i feel it.



11:00 WTF - I still feel like my taint/balls weigh 20 pounds. I hope this wears off quick\ldots 



Fast forward 5 days - Taint feels fine the weighted/squeezing feeling gradually wore off, I still feel positive about the whole experience, I feel as though I gained some decent insights into the inner workings of my brain, the universe, and existence. 



So in short, for me, 10-20mg is a fun range, very mild and uplifting while 30-40mg is rather intense and not for the faint-of-heart.  I do not consider this a party drug at 30+ mg unless you're well experienced with this kind of thing. I can see it being kind of fun at 10-15mg range at a party.



PROS vs CONS on 4-AcO-DMT vs Shrooms:



Pros: no nausea, gentle come-up, no anxiety, and its over before you know it.



Cons: not as colorful as mushrooms can be, not as deeply introspective as mushrooms, lacks some of the `magic' of magic mushrooms much in the same way that the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 lacks some of the magic of smoking true natural buds.
