I decided to try 4-FA after reading about it being similar to ecstacy and amphetamine but milder and since I had done ecstacy a few times and enjoyed the cleaner mellow rolls especially mixed with Cannabis.



Anyways back to this report, the first night that I got it I was a little nervous to take a full dose so I did about 40 mg\ldots I just weighed it out on the digital scale and then ate it..The effects from this small dose was alot like cocaine but milder and lasted alot longer I wasnt really tired anymore and had energy and felt good even though just before I had eaten it. 



I was thinking of maybe getting a good sleep then taking it the next night\ldots I also found that smoking weed produced zero munchies even on this light of a dose.



The next time I did about the same 40 mg except this time I ate about another 60 mg about an hour after the 40 kicked in and yea it was definatly stronger and felt alot like a very clean ecstacy roll\ldots  My pupils got big, I kindve got the chills a little but not bad and everything felt and sounded awsome\ldots ..The Peak Lasted about an Hour an a Half but all in all Id say a great overall high and it made for two nights of awsome fun on like less than 200 mg.  You cant beat that.



4-FA is a great alternative to ecstacy and very clean.
