I want to share this experience for two reasons.  I think it can be valuable as a description of my success with a simple recipe for marijuana brownies as well as an account of my own experience.   I've written the preparation first and described my encounter afterwards.  For reference, at the time of this experience I am 17 years old with drug history of mainly cannabis and alcohol with some pharmaceutical use and a single mushroom trip.



It was a very nice November afternoon when I cooked my first batch of marijuana brownies.  I came home from school with my friend/dealer and we weighed out a quarter ounce (7g) of good hydroponic weed.  Broke this up pretty well, not grinded but finer than normal for a blunt or bowl.  I made sure to keep the stems; although they aren't good for smoking they do have some THC content and are worthwhile for cooking.



The box of brownie mix (Duncan Hines) called for 2/3 cup of vegetable oil; this is where the weed entered the recipe.  I heated the oil in a plain cooking pot to an easy boil and put the weed in.  Let it stay in for about 10 minutes, during which I periodically pressed it with a spatula just to ensure that the full spectrum of cannabinoids was dissolving well.  This step here made the house REEK of weed.  After this I poured the oil with weed through a strainer back into the measuring glass, letting it sit for a while to make sure every precious drop got through.  Now I had 2/3 cup of oil with a quarter ounce worth of good weed dissolved inside.



After this, just cook as normal following the box's directions.  I was able to cut the tray into 12 potent brownies, slightly more than a half gram in each.  Worked well for everyone who had them, even very experienced smokers felt the effects for about 6 hours.  They tasted good too, just like normal brownies.  (Best eaten within a few days, I saved one and ate a little over a week later, it tasted terrible).  I personally felt them very strongly, my own experience follows.



I first consumed during the cooking process at about 3 pm.  After mixing the batter together in a bowl and pouring it into the tray, I ate the remaining batter with a spoon.  Why let anything go to waste?  I then put the tray in the oven and let it start cooking.  I was in a great mood, very excited about the brownies and was with a good group of people who I like a lot.  



While waiting for the brownies to cook (this took somewhere around a half hour), my friend and I took a quick trip to 7-11 to buy some chips.  I was very surprised to realize, on my way into the store, that I was already high just from the batter I ate!  I was feeling the early signs: bright colors, different thought process, giddiness, etc.  Sometimes I find this stage the most enjoyable.  Once we got back and the brownies finished I took them out and cut the tray up into 12.  Then 3 of us, me, my brother, and my friend, each ate one of ours.  This was at 3:30, and I was still feeling the high from before, and it was actually still building.



About 20 minutes later I felt what I believe was the onset of the brownie (it was somewhat unclear since I was already high).  I have a quick stomach, and it was pretty much empty so I knew it would come quickly. It was a little longer for the other two I was with.  Once it started coming on it built pretty quickly and strongly.  We hung out in my kitchen and just talked and joked around for a while, conversation flowed pretty easily.  At about 4:30 we headed to the basement to watch TV, which was hilarious.  We watched for a little over an hour and laughed a lot.  Had a few of those precious ``rounds of laughing'' where we would laugh at something and then maintain it by looking at each other and laughing about how we were laughing.  Gotta love those.



By this point I was feeling pretty good, like after smoking a sizeable amount, but more of a body-high than I feel when smoking marijuana.  The sensations were still building too; it would still be over an hour until I peaked.  I did not experience any amount of ``shaking'' and unsteadiness that I sometimes get when smoking.  I was glad about this; I don't really like that shaky feeling.  One surprise was that I did still experience cottonmouth.  Less so than after smoking, but definitely noticeable.  Did I get the munchies?  I'm not sure.  The sensation of eating was very nice, but I wasn't drawn to ``munch face'' like I sometimes am after smoking.  This was probably because eating marijuana can be kind of tough on the stomach.



Overall it was very pleasant for a while, but it started to build a little bit too much.  This happens sometimes with me, I get too ``out of it'' and internally withdrawn into my own thoughts.  I was feeling like this when my friend left to go home and my brother went upstairs.  I'm not exactly sure how much time passed, but I'm guessing it was about 6:30, 3 hours since eating, when the most profound part of my trip (and I do consider this a trip) occurred.



I was reclined and day dreaming pretty deeply, probably fading in and out, when I suddenly rose, raised my hands towards the ceiling and began chanting ``GOD! GOD! GOD!''  I don't know where it came from or how I started doing it.  I believe I said it 6 times, and I swear I felt better after each time.  Up until this point I was not very religious.  I was unsure about my beliefs, didn't know whether to believe in God or not.  It was clear to me that organized religion was not my thing, and I still feel the same about that.  However, I truly consider this a deep religious experience and I now strongly believe in God.  In reflection, I think it makes perfect sense that the revelation occurred at this time.  My life was somewhat ``messy'' at the time, with a lot of loose ends and the like.  Since then I have done my best to ``clean'' it up and feel a better sense of direction and purpose, and feel good about being part of something greater.



I was pretty drained by this point, but I felt great spiritually after the aforementioned outburst.  I headed straight to my room and took about a 6 hour nap, which contained some strange and interesting dreams.  I awoke at around 1:00 am and still felt a little bit high, but refreshed from the nap.



In conclusion, this was clearly a good experience.  Although stronger than I would usually prefer, I know I probably would not have had such a deep spiritual eruption with a smaller dose.  I believe I ate close to a gram that day, if you include the batter I had beforehand.  I have made brownies since, but prefer to eat somewhat less, especially in a social situation.  If I had a free day however, I would not rule out taking a very strong dose and seeing where it takes me.
