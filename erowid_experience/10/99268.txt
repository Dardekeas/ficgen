I had never heard of Moxy when I was offered it a psytrance themed hostel in Cambodia. I was looking for some kind of upper, and a new experience, so I accepted apprehensively after some very brief research.



I parachuted the powder, as did my friend, M, who is very new to psychedelics after a big dinner.



0:15 M and I began to feel a tightness in our arms, and a general sense of confusion. We sat down at a bar while a third friend had a drink, and tried to forget about having taken anything and let the experience happen to us without over analyzing.



0:30 The sense of confusion increased, coupled with an anxiety the source of which eluded me. I had gastrointestinal upset similar to that experiences by some after consuming mushrooms. This was accompanied by a strange taste/sensation in my mouth that was not helped by snacking on popcorn. M suggested that the feeling could be described as `slimy', which I think is well put. 



0:45 I was suddenly full of energy. Not the type of energy that would compel one to dance as in an MDMA experience, but rather a nervous excitability. My legs were shaking and I couldn't sit still. I was unsure whether I was enjoying this sensation or not. Suddenly I was immersed in conversation with my two friends. We discussed each others personalities, the demons we held inside of us and worked through them in an extremely open and constructive fashion. Constructive criticism was easy to accept and integrate and I grew a lot from the conversation.



1:30 At the end of this conversation I felt euphoric. I couldn't stop smiling. We had reached a fantastic place of closure and we rose from our seats feeling ready for anything. The sense of anxiety had melted away and I had come to accept the Moxy experience and feel safe within it. 



We walked down the main party-scene road and the bright lights were dazzling. Overwhelming but not frightening. We entered a nightclub and began to dance. I love trance music and despise commercial house. As always, at a typical nightclub, it was commercial house playing, but for the first time in my life I was accepting of the music and danced freely instead of dancing in an ironic or contrived fashion. I was overjoyed watching my friends dance, and I was full of energy. I felt as if the night was a big turning point in my travels overseas, and it was.



3:00 I began to feel as if the trip was over, and downed a couple shots of absynth. Upon returning to the dancefloor I realised this was not the case and I began to enjoy an MDMA-style experience where the lights and music became bright and intense. 



4:30 I suddenly was craving trance music, and felt as if the trip was truly over, so I went home to dance in my room to some psy. I realised at this point that I had plentiful energy, but decided to try and sleep.



4:45 I lay in bed and listened to some trippy psybient music which enjoying some amazing closed eye visuals, bright swirling colours and ancient stone temples, which I had a lot of control over. This was unexpected as it was my first visual hallucinations of the trip.



5:30 Unable to sleep I popped a Valium (10mg), and focused on my breathing. I was asleep half an hour later.



For me, Moxy was a very interesting drug as it seemed to have distinct and separate phases, with no overlap. It felt like a real journey, as opposed to the share rise, and undulating fall of an amphetamine experience. I feel that the initial phase is unpleasant, but worth enduring. 



I will try Moxy again if I ever find it :)



Good luck
