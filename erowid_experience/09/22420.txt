[Erowid Warning: While substituted phenylpiperazine and benzylpiperazines are known compounds used recreationally, plain non-substituted phenylpiperazine -- mistakenly equated with BZP in this report -- is not.]





Recently having just ordered some 1-phenylpiperazine Hydrochloride 97\% aka BZP [although hard (in terms of convincing) to get, still legal in the UK], I decided to try the substance straight away (having been reading everything on it that the web has to offer). It was late morning and I had just essentially woken up. 





12:45pm 





As I had no way of accurately measuring the chemical and knowing that I was intending somewhere between 50 - 200mg I decided to fill a gelatine capsule which I estimated as 500mg and then empty it out cut it up into 5 sections and ingested just the one, I.e hopefully 100mg. I think the main problem was either the dosage was too high (accidently) and/or I had a completely empty stomach. 





1:00pm 





Feeling very panicky now, pupils very dilated, nausea and very hot. I was very worried I was having a bad reaction (like you hear about with mdma very rarely), and seeing as I have never actually had any kind of amphetamine or ecstacy I thought that this might be quite possible. Anyway, the next two hours were the worst, I had to strip down completely and use lots of cold flannels to try to cool myself down as well as controlling my water intake (not too much, not too little).





3:00pm 





Start to feel a bit better, but still very dizzy. 





5:00pm 





It seems any positive effects are happening now, feel slightly speedy but in a more controllable way. 





12:00 (midnight)





now feeling close to baseline but have been fighting what feels like semi-flu/cold like symptoms for the last few hours. Mainly headache, feeling flushed and dizzy. Pupils also still dilated.





3:00am





I can't say I feel in a completely normal mind frame but I feel tired and think I will finally be able to sleep. I just hope tomorrow morning is not brought with a migraine [as read about in other BZP reports] as right now I don't appear to have any kind of headache.





Conclusion:





If I am to try BZP again I would like to firstly have a very full stomach and secondly in a dose thats more like 20-50mg and NO MORE, also a proper weight measured by an accurate balance mainly for reasurance. 





Also a side note, this experience may well have been a positive one because the first 2 hours on this drug showed me how important my sanity and health are to me and led me towards different thoughts about my personal use of such chemicals.
