I decided on a dose of 20mg because a couple friends of mine had done it at 20mg and told me it wasn't very intense, they said their 20mg experience matched my 10mg experience.  It obviously affected me differently.



I had a few jell-o shooters earlier that evening.  I was quite relaxed.



It took about an hour to start going, but once it started, it was very immersive, almost overwhelming.  A very intense, vibrating, warm feeling throughout my muscles particularly in my arms and legs, this matched the vibrating, lively visual hallucinations (I looked up at the stars and they would vibrate, the colored patterns on the bed and carpet were indescribable) and echoing auditory hallucinations. This was accompanied with such an immense feeling of energy I did not know what to do with myself.  Deep breaths helped me to keep my wits about me.  I had taken 10mg on a previous occasion and this trip dwarfed that one.  Overall the come up was far more intense than I would have liked.



There was slight discomfort in my stomach, normally nothing major, but I went into the bathroom and it didn't smell so good.  I gagged (didn't actually vomit, although it likely sounded like it did), then went outside and soaked up some fresh winter air.  That cleared up my stomach issue and brought the high down to a much more enjoyable level.  I began to notice a very pleasant amplification of my tactile senses.  I greatly enjoyed much hip hop \& jungle.  



I kept on analyzing the hip hop songs, trying to decipher if there was a message in the song, what it was, and if I agreed with it or not, it was peculiar.  I came to the conclusion that I can like a hip hop song with an awful message just because it sounds good.  No matter how many times I hear about how cool it is to shoot people, I'm still not going to buy a gun.  



I thought a lot about my computer usage.  The first thing I do when I get home from work is open MSN/IRC/ICQ and Winamp.  I questioned whether my verbal skills suffered due to a lack of verbal discussion and an excess of typed discussion.  For me, this type of analysis occurs with AMT or psilocybin as well but can easily make me feel bad or get out of control; this was not the case with 2ct2.  



Once I came down (about the 6 hour point) I felt utterly exhausted.  I hadn't slept very well the previous night, and it was really late.  After a little sleep I felt okay.  The next day, I was still very tired.  



The day after I was talking with a friend of mine, he's a fellow computer programmer, more educated and experienced than me.  Normally, when he says something I don't understand I'll just be like ``oh, okay'' even if I don't understand it.  Today I inquired, and asked him to explain.  I learned something out of it too.  The day after that work was more enjoyable than usual; I gave it my all and had a decent time.  I even made a suggestion to the manager (whom I normally avoid) about synchronizing all the clocks in the store.



There was no paranoia at all, which can often be a problem for me with tryptamines like psilocybin and AMT.  I felt in control even during the powerful come-up.  There were nice feelings of elation, sociability, and warmth for the second half of the trip.  I suppose I got a little hung up on body language, but nothing major, it happens when I'm sober too.  I should have been better rested before I tried it, and I believe alcohol contributed to the stomach discomfort.
