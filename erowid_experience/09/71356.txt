50mg experience report of 4FlouroAmphetamine (4FMP/4FMA/4flo etc)



Me: male, 160lb, extensive drug history regarding meth, MDMA and ecstasy pills. Prescribed Lamictol for Bipolar Disorder.

Girlfriend: female, 100lbs, moderate drug history regarding meth, MDMA and ecstasy pills. No prescriptions



My mindset: relaxed yet excited to try a new drug

Inentions: Have a good time w/ gf via empathetic effects/euphoria

Stomache: empty



GF appeared happy yet a bit worried about trying a new drug and ate about 1 hour before hand.



T0:00: GF and I take 50mg of 4FlouroAmpehtamine orally.



T0:40: I'm feeling something for sure but it could be placebo at this point. It feels like a slight come up on MDMA but no stimulation at all.  GF is feeling stimulation.  I'm feely happy, not euphoric.



T1:10: I'm feeling stimulated, but not in a twacked sort of way.  Hard to explain the feeling, best left as `passive energy.'  GF feels twacked out to a degree.  I feel very, very euphoric, in a MDMA like way.  I feel MDMA like effects more then amphetamine effects, which I sort of feel at this point.  I'm perspiring a little bit and the window is open.  Studying seems plausible, but I would much rather flirt w/ my girl.  GF says this would help her study.



T1:30 I feel like any of the stimulation I had is aleviating, not sure exactly.  I know that when I am rolling and I think I'm going to drop off soon I will, so I'm trying not to think about it and just record effects.  I still feel really good, not as much MDMA-like as before but still significant.  When I concentrate, I can actually make waves of MDMA-like euphoria come back.



T2:00: I'm definitley not feeling as good as before but I'm not crashing.  I still feel good.  I feel like at the end of an MDMA roll.



2:40 I'm still feeling the same, not crashed at all.  I decide to vaporize $\sim$50mg between my girl and I.  I feel very high again, not as much as the 1:10 point. Good booster dose.



How I felt at peak: Very MDMA-like except not as strong empathy wise.  Stimulation was great, it was like taking a ecstasy pill w/ an amphetamine in it as that you can dance and do stuff easily (Pure MDMA relaxes me) but it had no come down, as well as not any kick to it.



I vaporized it two more times later that night, w/ effects lowering each time.  The last time I smoked I did not get high at all.



I could sleep great on this, even after vaporizing it.



I think the magic dose is going to be around 80-120mg.



Problems: none, literally.

After effects: sleep was fine, didn't feel crashed at all the next morning, neither did I feel `e tarded.'
