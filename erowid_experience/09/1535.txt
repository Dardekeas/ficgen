I have seen Kava called `psychoactive' in both the Psychedelic Encyclopedia and on the web, which increased my interest in trying out this new substance.  My first attempt at Kava was thwarted by the employees at the health food store (NOTE: These people are not Psychonauts\ldots  in fact, they are anti-psychonaut\ldots  never listen to them!), they told me to buy a Kava Tea\ldots  start small they said, work your way up.



This turned out to be a big mistake, as Kava is not very soluble in water and thus it makes no sense to drink a Tea made from the stuff (though the tea was not entirely unpleasant).  One would have to consume the actual root to get any effects, or at least some extracted form of it. 



My second experiment with Kava included three friends, I took 2 55\% Kavalactone extract pills, as did one guy\ldots  the other two took each 1 pill.  The result was nothing except night and the Kava literally stole our high).



My third Kava experiment involved the same pills, but this time I took three\ldots  and again there were no noticable PSYCHOACTIVE changes, though I may or may not have had some supposed `stress relief', it was still nothing like the a mild sense of refreshment (we had smoked pot earlier) that I have heard described.



Finally, on the fourth day, I decided to break the pattern and try something new.  I emptied six of the capsules into a shot glass, then filled a small juice glass with milk.  I slowly mixed them together and drank all the contents.  The theory here is that the capsule inhibited digestion of the active ingredients.  This time I got what I would call a `Threshold Effect'.  I did not feel high or stoned, but I definitely felt more creative and imaginative\ldots  in addition I felt slight increase in sensation and mild blurring of the vision.  This lasted for about two hours during which I felt very free.  The effects seemed to hint to me that Kava would be an excellent drug to combine with Marijuana or, possibly Salvia 5 or 10x.  Further experiments will be reported.
