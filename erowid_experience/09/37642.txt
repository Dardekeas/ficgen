Introduction and Recipe/Preparation

--------------------------------------------------------------

I'd just finished reading DMT: The Spirit Molecule (an excellent book, I highly recommend it) so I was pretty familiar with DMT and have actually started extracting it for a smokable form (shhh\ldots ) when I came across ayahuasca.  It was at this point I realized mimosa hostilis (a rootbark used for dmt extraction) could be used to make an orally active DMT tea when combined with syrian rue (i got sent some for free by the company).  So I decided I would give it a try since I had a ton of extra mimosa rootbark.  So I scanned for what I thought would be the most reliable recipe and began to make my brew.  I put 4 g of syrian rue into a mortar and pestle and ground it up to a very fine powder.  I then put this in a pot of a combination of $\sim$200mL tap water, 250mg vitamin c, and the juice of about 4 lemons.  I boiled this for approximately 25 mins until the `magic' could be seen under a blacklight (this works and is excellent eye candy as the potion turns a milky color).  I then put the tea and seeds into a cup and forced it all done, seeds included.  



The previous night, I began preparing the mimosahuasca by cutting about 17g of mimosa rootbark into about 3-4inch strips and then putting it all in the blender on chop.  Once the strips were a fine, purplish powder I added it into a pot of 750mL of water, 300mg of vitamin C, and the juice of 4 lemons.  I let this boil for $\sim$35 minutes (and god does it stink) and I then filtered the water and repeated the process with new water.  I then combined the two mixtures (approximately 1200mL) and boiled it down to a little over 500mL of mimosahuasca.  I put it in the fridge in an airtight container to be drank tomorrow.



----------------------------------------------------------------

Trip               / Setting: in my room with my girlfriend C

----------------------------------------------------------------

So I had already drank the MAOI and was beginning to feel its effects (characterized by a physical fatigue with no mental effects.)  It was at this point I got the mimosahuasca brew and measured it out.  A little over 500 mL, perfect amount I thought.    So I put it all in a tea cup and sat down to drink the magic.  However, once I tasted it I nearly vomited right then.  It was the foulest, most disgusting feeling and tasting think I have ever put in my mouth.  Its so bitter it feels like it sticks to your throat and then smell and taste will remind you of stomach bile.  I took about 4 or 5 big gulps (later measured to be $\sim$75mL) and could drink no more.  I was really disappointed because I figured there was no way I was gonna trip but there was also know way I could drink anymore without puking (and therefore wasting) the tea.  So, 15 minutes later I got some vegetable soup for dinner and as I was looking at the soup I noticed it was more colorful then usual (like the beginning of an acid/shroom trip).  I thought, huh, maybe i'll have a mild acid trip with some awesome color enhancements.  



So I went back up to my bedroom and was watching CSI when I started to hear a voice.  It was the most beautiful voice I have ever heard and it asked me if I was ready.  I answered telepathecally that I was and almost instantly I felt my body die, a rather overpowering and eerily incredible feeling.  I was no longer in my body and was simply a mind watching the program.  However as I was watching it I began to notice the characters asking me questions and looking right at me through the screen and it was at that point I realized I was no longer in my room, I was in the Las Vegas, Nevada crime lab working alongside Gil Grisham.  I helped to solve 4 murders, 2 of which have never been any episodes (trust me, i've seen them all) before I came down off the trip, about 4-5 hours after ingestion of the mimisohuasca.  I had no after effects and was actually able to fall asleep (I say actually because I am an insomniac).  



----------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

----------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning I recalled more details of my trip, most of which I have been told not to repeat to anyone and I realized just how powerful of a tool mimosa (and DMT) is, and I say tool instead of drug because this is NOT a recreation drug.  



I'm a 100\% healthy 19 yr old teen with an extensive history of multiple drug experiences and a 145 IQ and I know how to handle my high.
