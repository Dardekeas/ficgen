Ok, this is what truly happened, this was my first time\ldots 





I was in a group of 6 people, inside at nighttime. The only light source  was a candle in 


the centre of the room, and we were all around it. Anthony just had a  huge dose, he 


did prana breathing with his dose and I was shaking with excitement\ldots   


a full body shake that I could not control. Now it was my turn. 


`Gastro' held the glass bong with the glass pipe attached, he


lit it carefully making sure not to fully vaporise it, he said.





`NOW!' 





I inhaled as much as I could stand; it 


        was instantly a shock, very harsh and 


        strangely tasty, very concentrated, 


        smelt exactly like a certain type of


	concentrated Chinese Jasmine tea.


        As I tookin my second inhalation, I 


        witnessed a very strange visual effect. 


        The glass bong pipe and my hands rushed 


        away into the distance and the background


        view of the floor came straight for me.


        The movie `Contact' does the same effect


        brilliantly when Jodie Foster is in the sphere 


        during her dimension jump. It got to the point


        where I knew I wouldn't be able to hold the 


        bong-pipe. `Gastro' took it off me and I sat back,


        looking around the room. I lookedstraight at the


        candle, which was separating before my eyes,two


        images of the candle was on either side of it, two 


        different colours, the light I was perceiving in my 


        visual field was separating. As I looked around the room 


        a bit more, I saw the same effect happen everywhere, there


        was three images of everything, all slightly overlaying each 


        other and transparent. I looked at `Gastro' in astonishment 


        and remember smiling, I could see him clearly, but also could perceive 


        moving energy segments of brilliant colour all over his skin and bone 


        structure of his face. I managed to push myself back in a last effort  and 


        lay back. About 15 seconds had passed since my second toke.





I know that I was having an intense revelation, one that I can not talk about 


        here, but one I remember every time I use DMT, the revelation was one of Ultimate 


        Realness, that is all I can say. The visuals I definitely recall with utmost clarity, 


        I feel gifted this way.





I closed my eyes and focused immediately into the distance, it was very   clear, 


        crystalline and symmetric yet totally organic. Out of the terrifyingly   complex 


        colours and patterns emerged and formed an entity that sneered at me,  grinning 


        wildly with two piercing eyes, it was free floating and fractalising.  Swirling arms 


        and appendages formed out of its now more solid ethereal body of light.



		

       I sensed or imagined that smaller invisible beings were slicing me up across the chest and stomach 

        with laser sharp instruments, it was painful, but somewhat acceptable and bearable. In retrospect, this

        was perhaps the DMT vapour touching my lung pathways. The Entity formed greater within my closed

        eye visual perception and was growing more menacing, I felt it trying to attach it self to me, or get inside me somehow. I did what I felt had 

        to do. I mentally said and intended the thought `COME ON THEN!' 

        and threatened back

        at it what it was doing to me. With this, it started to dissipate, in 

        the reverse way that it had formed. As it subsided away back into the 

        colourful patterns and geometrics I pleaded with it to come back, but 

        it had gone.



		

		The first thing I communicated to the group was `Carry on' 

then I said,



        


                      `THERE'S 

        NO SUCH THING AS FICTION'              

        


        




It was a truly life changing event, from this moment on, I realised that all shaman cultures and religions were based upon direct personal experiences and that all of them had truth behind them.
