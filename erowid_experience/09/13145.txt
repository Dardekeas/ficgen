100mg 5meo-DiPT powder was dissolved in 20ml water



07:45 1ml/5mg down the hatch



08:00 J does the same dose, oh shit, no smokes, drive to store \& buy smokes



08:15 half way home *Sound an alert!* 



08:18 make it home, smoke some cannabis to ease tension



08:26 definitely something, mild euphoria 

	

08:50 .5ml/2.5mg down the hatch



09:00 another bowl of pot, easy does it, J also does additional dose



09:10 yawning, positive tension, so far so good



09:23 *hello foxy* nice to meet you, very very groovy to make your acquaintance 



09:30 its only been 7 min?! time is slowed way down, visual enhancement



09:35 J reports feeling mild euphoria but is not getting the rush I feel



09:48 nice visuals, mild peaking, euphoric but not noticing any sensual aspect



10:00 tripping pretty good , mild but good, grin and giggle, light visuals



10:35 hungry, J makes snacks! 



11:00 eating was bad, stomach hurts, pot helps, take a Kaopectate



12:00 coming down, almost baseline, euphoria \& rush are over, watch tv, sleeping pills



01:20 sleep



I would repeat this experience but I would do a few things differently, first off I would take at least 7.5mg, or perhaps 10mg to begin with, then maybe an additional 5, for 12.5 or 15mg. The 7.5mg total I took just wasn't enough.  Second, I would not eat during the experience even if I was very hungry. This drug is more recreational then introspective. No problems of the world going to be solved on Foxy. I don't think it has much therapeutic potential but certainly is an interesting drug. The trip itself was psychedelic like a mild LSD or mushroom experience with MDMA like bursts of euphoria, but instead of gaining clarity I get a little stupid - although this may have been due to the use of cannabis. Senses are enhanced, especially vision.  Body load was noticeable, nervous energy, J reported pressure on her solar plexus much like LSD, which she dislikes. After eating I had severe gut pain, and it felt like gas bloating. Walking around outside was bliss.  We watched a Depeche Mode concert on cable but it didn't sound right.  Talk was easy, but real conversation was difficult. 



There was a slight empathetic undertone but not intense like MDMA. I would like to try a higher dose, maybe the much referred to tactile enhancement will show itself over 10mg.
