After a recent run of fairly crap, hard to get herb round our way we read about this stuff on the net, so we headed off to the local headshop to see what they had in stock, as it happened they had 3g bags of spice diamond at Â£25, so we bought a bag without too many expectations.



We got home and my mate skinned one up, the smell was an odd one, somewhat like opening a jamaica ginger cake, very sweet indeed. So after a few tokes I notice a slight light-headedness and feel a little heavy, not unlike the herb itself, after finishing the spliff we decided to smoke a few bongs which went down very nicely, smoother than ganja.



A few bowls in on the bong and we were thoroughly baked, a heavy back of the brain body stone that made me want to sit down and not get up again for a long time. We proceeded to smoke the rest of the bag over the day in bongs and pure spliffs and were pretty pleased with the results overall, not quite as satisfying taste or smell wise as ganja but certainly a very good alternative and its made a believer out of me.
