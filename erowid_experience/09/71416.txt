I'm still a little fuzzy about what just happened. I stayed up on Adderall last night, so I've felt sort of fatigued all day. I smoked a bunch of resin before dinner, and I was lying in bed surfing the web when my step-dad knocked on my door. I got up and opened the door, he handed me a belt that I'd put in the laundry.



The next thing I remember was completely forgetting about everything, my mind and vision going completely black and discovering that my face was somehow connected to the floor. It felt like I had just teleported into another dimension.



I realized that I had somehow suddenly blacked out, and my step-dad was still right in front of me. He sat me down and gave me a long talk about drugs. Whatever. This was one of the strangest things I've ever had happen to me and I guess the moral is to be careful about smoking weed when you're fatigued.
