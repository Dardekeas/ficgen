Like curtains of raindrops falling down

Each glittering jewel a twinkling sound

your love sweeps upon me

within me

without

A breath of deadly beauty

And conciousness therein

You glitter and shine

And turn inside out

these selves that are calling my soul to come out

A sweet breath is blowing my soul into fire

My body is dying so that I might go higher

Into the void I now burst anew

The celestial creatures a blessing bestow

On my selfless dying and comedy show

The same experience a friend once had

to wander through the heavens

to experience the riddle of the universe

to remember what you forgot

to know who you are

to know you've come so far

to know your soul's evolution is infinite

to be ordered to say your piece of the puzzle

that is the fathomless mystery 

that is the universe within us

to feel divine love ravage our body

and turn every cell inside out

to feel your bones ache

and know that one day your body will die

to know what will be left behind

to go beyond the door

that is guarded by the image of our self

to sacrifice this image so we may be born anew

well my friend said he did not know what to do 

when he came back and had to talk to me and you

but he was very humble that friend of mine

who had sacrificed his body

to witness the mysteries of time

just imagine

just imagine being a limitless being

constantly imaging itself

constantly getting to know itself

constantly making love to itself

constantly suprised

and constantly being alarmed by itself

constantly enchanted by itself

constantly dying and constantly being born

constantly mended and constantly torn

constantly crying

and constantly laughing at us

the myriad lifeforms that inhabit it

that are it

that are its eyes and ears

And after all this I hear an angel's astonished shout

does it really fucking matter

who we think we are

does it really fucking matter if the Jones have a bigger car

does it really fucking matter 

if someone beats you up

does it really fucking matter

if you live in a rubbish bin

when such truly timeless beauty

can be found within
