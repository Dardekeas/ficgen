 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 



I used to huff butane a lot. Like every day for about a month, not really realising how badly it was affecting me. I used to huff at least a can a day and used to make me naturally paranoid, delirious, dizzy and freaked out all the time. I suppose I did it because I was addicted and I didn't know.



Anyway one time I huffed 2 cans and didn't pass out, I have never passed out from Butane. Anyway I sat there huffing away and had my first and only hallucination ever. I saw a fat man in front of me trying to hit me. He swung his fists at me like he was physically hitting me. All I could do was sit there and drool because I forgot how to use my muscles. I just remember being so scared of this man but not being able to move because after 1 can I never could move all I could do was drool.



Anyway while I was seeing this fat man trying to hit me I actually felt a tap on my shoulder and I was suddenly able to move. I turned around and it was like I wasn't seeing with my eyes. I saw a beautiful woman with my entire vision (I can't really explain this because I didn't physically see her. I saw her in my mind but I actually felt the tap on my shoulder.) She placed a cookie in my mouth and I could feel and taste it. I closed my mouth and bit into the cookie and everything disappeared, including the cookie. I instantaneously was not at all high and could feel no after effects. I think I probably would've died there if it was not for that woman.



I have never huffed butane since and try to restrain from harming my body in any way any more.



Thank you God.
