A few friends and I were sitting around trying to decide on something to do. That's when the subject of whippets came up. It sounded like fun, so we took a trip to the local porn shop and bought a case of 24 nitrous oxide `bullets', and a pack of punching balloons. One of us owned a cracker, so we were all set. 



We then all sat around in the bedroom, and began. Friend \#1 took one first. I watched as she leaned back and began laughing quietly to herself, about nothing in particular. She then handed me a balloon with 2 bullets cracked into it. I had never done it before, so I was a little nervous- afraid I would make a fool of myself or something. But I proceeded to exhale all of my oxygen, and take a deep breath of the sweet cool gas, hyperventilating into the balloon. I started feeling very detached and heard a strange reverberating noise which for some reason made me think of an alien space ship or something. I continued to try and breath in more nitrous, but I was no longer able to keep my mouth on the balloon in order to exhale, and I began laughing hysterically. Suddenly, I got an intense feeling that I had lost something. An entire movie played in my mind at top speed, in what felt like a few seconds, and I started thinking `I have to go find it'. What `it' was I still have no idea. But I thought I was walking somewhere in my mind, and I could feel my body start to slowly sink to the bed. 



When I realized I was laying down, I sat up and rubbed my curiously numb face, and noticed everyone looking at me. They asked if I was okay, and I said I was great, why? To which they replyed `you just fell over'. We all were sent into peals of laughter, until the affects of the wonderful gas wore off. After that, we did whippets at least once a week, each time more exciting and interesting than before.
