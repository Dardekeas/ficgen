Well all I can say is\ldots ITS SHIT!! I must say I had a few  closed eye visuals, but other than that it felt like I had the flu.



I bought my pack of dramamine on Thursday, \& I said I'd take it on Friday night.  So on Friday at around 11:15pm I took my 10 pills (it only comes in packs of 10 where I live) chewing the first 5 by accident (which left my tongue all numb \& a really bad taste) \& swallowing the other 5. I waited for about 30 mins, but I couldn't stay awake so I went to sleep.  I woke up around 1:00am (I think so, I didn't check what time it was) my head was spinning, but I wasn't having any hallucinations.  I went back to sleep for about 10 mins, then woke up.  I kept going to sleep for a few minutes then waking up, this carried on till around 6:00am.  I finally went to sleep for about 2 hours.  I then woke up at 8:00am, \& I had to take a piss.  When I got up out of bed \& stood up, my head felt really light.  When I tried walking my legs felt like they were made of concrete.  I went to the toilet then went back to bed.  I got up at 11:00am and went downstairs had a cup of coffee \& watched wrestling, while I was watching wrestling closed my eyes \& I could see stuff like skulls \& shit.  I thought that was pretty cool. It all lasted till around 3:00pm, then I felt normal again.



All in all it was OK, but I probably won't try it again.  also my dick kinda shrinks and that totally scared me.
