I recently ordered a 1/4 ounce of Sceletium Tortuosum for \$40 USD after reading some historical information and old trip reports on an ethnobotanical website.  I received my package which contained a baggie of brown, fine ground powder.  Some of the historical information mentioned that sceletium had been snorted by indiginous African tribes.  I snorted approximately 1gm of the fine powder. After about 15 minutes I began to feel a little giddy and got up to walk around.  Soon thereafter I experienced a powerful rush that reminded me of the onset of MDMA.  Over the next 30min., I had a few more of these rushes, though not quite as powerful as the first. For the next few hours, I experienced a potent caffeine-like buzz tinged with some euphoric elements.  I became very talkative and stayed up late into the night.  I was expecting something a little more sedate, but even so, the experience was fairly enjoyable.



About a week later, I mixed sceletium with some tobacco and smoked it.  This was more similar to the relaxing sceletium experiences I had read about.  Similar to cannabis but without the clouded thought and not as potent.



Overall, I think this herb deserves some more investigation.
