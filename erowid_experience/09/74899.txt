General Facts:

I'll note that the only thing I am prescribe of this concoction is Lexapro which I got on a little over a year ago after spending several years on St. John's Wort \& other remedies for a diagnosis of PTSD \& moderate depression.



I'm familiar with many substances from E to Acid to AMT to Shrooms \& Herb.  Years since I've been into that or any hard stuff. I'm more interested now in nootropics (smart drugs) for day to day life enhancement.  



So my pops was away for a day to attend a seminar on Huntington's Disease (if any of you are familiar, it explains my interest in nootropics) so I decided to take a day concocting a mix of supplies I had on hand.

 

Experience:

8:00 am - 200mg Modafinil

Modafinil is a fantastic substance almost a dream drug but one of the few downsides is that its effects taper with long term usage.  If used daily for a month its only about half as effective.  But this was a recent acquisition for me and I hadn't taken any in about 6 wks or so.  20 mins after I popped the pills, I began to feel the usual warm awareness \& slight euphoria bubble up.  I listened to some music which can sound a lot better on modafinil \& messed around a bit on the comp.



10:00 am - 100mg Modafinil, 800mg Oxiracetam

This is way better than folgers in your cup.  Just a little booster to keep the morning cruisin. Oxiracetem works gives me a little kick in the pants (motivation/energy) not on the level of modafinil but it adds lucidity too.  After a little while of flying through some chores, and a lot of errands my responsibilities are done so\ldots .



1:30 pm- 4 mg Lorazepan

This turns out to be not what I expect.  I know I had done it once upon a time long long ago \& it seemed pretty fantastical.  Unfortunately about all I really noticed was a return to nomal energy level \& total lack of anxiety (might've killed any possible post-modafinil shakiness) but no real body high or any high of any kind that I'd remembered. Minor downer\ldots 



4:00 pm - 1g Phenibut \& 100mg Modafinil

In an attempt to finish my gumbotrip on a brigher note I add 1g of Phenibut \& 1 more pill of moda.  Managed to give the trip an oxymoronic feel.  Chilled out with the lorazepam \& phenibut but still amp'd from the modafinil booster.



It was pretty good all in all. I was totally coherent \& functional \& slight more than happy for the whole day.  Though I'd expected the lorazepam to have a larger effect,  So not mind blowing though If someone boxed this combo as a workweek survival kit I'd be first in line.



Carry on!
