I bought a 3g bag of spice (product name - k2 summit). I stopped smoking weed a month ago and have no tolerance anymore. I was curious about spice hype.



T-0:00 - I rolled a pinch of it (guessing around .2 if it was marijuana) into a joint with a third of a cig. I lit it up and thought nothing much would happen.



T-0:02 - After smoking half of the joint (5-7 hits) i could barely keep my eyes open. I felt out of it as if I was stoned. 



T-0:10 - I felt sooooo stoned. Taking to friends that smoke weed everyday and they dont feel much (they had their own joint)



T-0:20 - full effects. Music is good and I feel like I'm completely baked. A friend I hadnt seen in a while came over and I just started laughing. He made a couple of jokes and I was like a 4yr old retarded kid.



T- 1:00 - still feeling good but starting to feel like I'm coming down



T-1:30 - feel like when I come down from bud\ldots just kinda out of it but still feeling great



T-2:00 - tired\ldots feel good but not stoned anymore



T-5:00 - smoked another joint with a friend and got stoned again but not like before (just like real bud)



T-6:00 - came down but dont really mind cuz everything still feels good.



$\sim$overall spice is fun if you cant smoke real bud anymore..you need a low weed tolerance to get the full effects? I read tons of stories of these retards doing a ton of powdered JWH-018..Its not harmless like weed. YOU CAN GET HEART PROBLEMS! watch out and dont do too much pure powder and dont smoke spice everyday. There is not enough research on it yet.
