I was hospitalized by the state recently and diagnosed for the millionth time with adhd, so the doc prescribed me a high dose of strattera right away. The effects were awful. My entire hospital stay I was on bedrest because of extremely low blood pressure, about 40 for systolic. My doctor (who was obviously a quack) said that it was not because of the strattera but it was currently the only med I was on. My blood pressure is normally excellent as I have been told many times by my psychiatrist who takes it twice week. But when I took this for the first time I could not stand without fainting or stumbling around and falling down. Overall the worst experience I've had with any drug by far. But I got that doctor fired for threatening me with his comment of `if you don't take this medication I'll keep you in the hospital for a long time'. He apparently forgot his Hippocratic oath of first do no harm. So I will never take this medication ever again, I never had any problems like this with any drug.
