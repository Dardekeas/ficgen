I had somehow gotten tangled into going to a semi-formal dance with my best friends girlfriend while he took a mutual friend of ours.  At this point I was drinking regularly (about 3 times a week) and smoking marijuana almost everyday.  I also have varied experience with pharmaceuticals, including percocet, vicodin, darvocet and several muscle relaxants.  The dance was on a Saturday night, and I acquired about an 1/8 of kind buds for prior enjoyment.  I had also taken 10 mg of Xanax, in .5 mg pink solid tabs, from my mom, who suffers from mild depression.  



One of my friends is a causal user of the drug, and I spoke with her about its effects along with researching the drug on websites, so I felt confident and well prepared.  I was also going to be with several sober people, including my friend's girlfriend. Other then doxycycline, an anti-biotic, I was on no other drugs at the time.  I had found nothing in any of my research to indicate that Xanax would interact with the anti-biotic. 



I went to D's house, and we smoked the marijuana and prepared to go to the dance.  I was pretty high at the time, and was still feeling the effects as we reached the boat that the dance was to be held on.  I ingested 6 caplets as soon as we got to the dance.  The music was pretty bad, top 40 pop stuff.  I felt somewhat awkward because of the confused situation with D's dates and mine.



At about T+45 began to feel the effects of the drug.  Mostly a mild stoning effect, but motion seemed incredibly interesting.  I left the group I was with (always a bad idea when on a new substance) and went to hang out with some of my other friends who were drinking.  I felt extraordinarily happy while my drunken friends seemed very sluggish.  I did not have a great deal of energy, but I was not tired at all.



The boat returned at about 11 and we disembarked.  I was still somewhat high, but defiantly down from the peak stoning effects.  We then went back to D's dates house.  Once there, I informed D that I was going to take another 5 pills, or 2.5 mg.  He okayed the dosage, and I took it with a little bit of water.  [On a side note, I was not hungry at all that night, nor was I thirsty].  I felt the effects much sooner this time, about 20 minutes after I ingested the pills.  I assume that the earlier does compounded with the second one, because it was much more intense.  



I have no further memory of the night, and what follows is what I was told by D:

We were watching a movie when I took my dose, and had been planning on going to a friend's party after the movie.  The party got busted, so we remained at the house and watched another movie.   I spent about 20 minutes moving my hand back and forth in front of my face.  I was also having trouble with expressing ideas.   At about 2, D secured my a ride back to my house with his girlfriend.  She told me that she dropped me off and opened my door.  I assume that I passed out after this, because I woke up in the clothes that I had worn the night before on the floor of my room.



I highly enjoyed this experience.  I do regret the setting in which it was taken.  I think that a more friendly place with better lighting and closer friends would have been much more suitable.  I also *HIGHLY* recommend utilizing a sitter, as blacking out seems to be a common occurrence.  The next day I had no hangover.  I would have been more comfortable with a lower dose in the hopes that my memory of the night would be more clear.  All in all, it was a pleasurable experience.  This night is recalled from a journal that I keep of my experiences, which I highly recommend.
