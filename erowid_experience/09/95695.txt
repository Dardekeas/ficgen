T+0: Initial dose, instant change of consciousness. Very excited for this.



T+1: walls beginning to breathe gently, feeling great! Looking forward to a heavy, colorful experience.



T+2: beginning to come up harder. Visual distortion is more pronounced. Auditory hallucinations beginning to manifest. General shift in consciousness has taken hold; this is a sarcastic-feeling drug so far; very in-your-face psychedelia. Beautiful so far, very smooth come-up, in waves only partially obscured by the brazen euphoria of mdma. I can tell this is going to be a very introspective, enlightening experience.



T+2:30 approx 2mg 2cp insufflated, approx 40mg mdma insufflated. Very pronounced rolling effects with steadily increasing psychedelia..



T+3: more and more of an edge to this trip; I'm starting to go nuts. The headspace created by this unique combo is nothing other than perfect. I feel very at peace with the universe, as well as the current situation I am in. Getting increasingly obvious OEVs and CEVs; distortion is becoming prominent. Heavier light trails The bodyload is hypnotic from 2cp and yet slightly hurried by the mdma. I can imagine this is what mescaline feels like; I've heard the two compared, but it's interesting to feel as though I could compare the two, even having not tried mescaline yet.. Facitious introspection is easy; this seems like a circuit junkie's psychedelic wonderland. I'm gonna have some fun tonight =p



T+4: more and more frequent waves of euphoria and relaxed stimulation. My stomach is a little off. I attribute this to the fact I ingested a phenethylamine, lol. Gonna get lost in the next two hours, can't wait!



T+4:20: 60mg mdma insufflated. Crazy high.



[at this point we go on a very fulfilling journey to the woods. I was lost in the world the entire time, beautiful experience..]



T+8: visuals are sparse, underwhelmed by the lack of intensity. Everyone's pretty absorbed by their phones. I'm thinking about T+12 and T+13



T+9: smoking most definitely obscures of the high. Right now life looks unreal\ldotsthe morning sky through the window is a painting. Love this.



T+12:30: I slept through about 3 hours of my plateau, woke up feeling refreshed and still tripping, although I would venture to guess this is the start of the come-down. Time for some rocket fuellll ;)



T+15: Auditory distortion still pronounced, Some visual inaccuracies. Very beautifuld day out, I feel as though the pleateau hasn't worn off yet..about to insufflate 200mg MDMA and see how it goes\ldots
