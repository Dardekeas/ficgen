After reading as much as I can about ayahuasca, I've finally decided to try it for myself. I already have experiences with many other psychedelics and other types of drugs, but I won't get into that.



The ingredients used in this brew were Mimosa Hostilis (Jurema) root bark and Peganum Harmala (Syrian Rue). To prepare the brew, I used 15g of Mimosa Hostilis and 3g of Peganum Harmala. The Mimosa was ground as fine as I could get it in a coffee grinder, then added to a solution of 70\% water/30\% lemon juice. I boiled this for 30 minutes, then filtered the liquids into another pot. I repeated this process two more times and discarded the solids. The liquids that I was left with was then simmered down to about one cup, and sat aside to cool. While it was cooling, I ingested 3g of ground rue.



30 minutes after eating the ground rue, I started sipping the brew. I had the majority of the brew drank, minus the disgusting solids left at the bottom, within 30 minutes. During the first 10 minutes I started to feel the nausea from the tannins in the brew, and had to lay back and concentrate on not puking. The nausea came and went after this, up to about 10 minutes of finishing the brew.



I was in a dimly lit room, with only the TV, two computer monitors, and a nightlight lighting the room. I was with two friends who have both previously done ayahuasca, and one friend was drinking the brew right along with me. The setting and mood was pretty good for me.



I started to feel the effects taking hold after I finished the brew. It was like a mild body high with visuals at first that started to build with time. I felt a bit uncoordinated with a buzz that flowed into my head. Things started to look more colorful and move around a bit. When I closed my eyes, I could see colorful designs that moved and flowed behind my eyelids. With my eyes open, I could see things move around slowly and melt. Peoples faces seemed to sway around and look like other people, but I was completely aware of who was around me and what I was doing.



Being my first time, I was warned that I would purge, but I didn't. I did feel like I could easily puke, but somehow managed to hold it in. My other friend that drank the brew with me did puke, however. I'm lucky that I didn't puke that night, being my first time, but I have purged every other time that I have taken ayahuasca. I am told that the purge is caused by the tannins in the brew, and there is a number or ways to reduce the tannins, but that is beyond the scope of this story.



As the ayahuasca continued to flow through my system, time did seem to stop once, and I started to feel like I had the psychic power to be able to talk to other people in my head, but I knew that it wasn't real. At one point, I felt like I was stuck in this loop that kept repeating itself. At this point, I felt like I had entered both heaven and hell while still on Earth, and I would be left in this state for all eternity.



Eventually, I fell asleep after what I guess would be 8 hours after starting to drink the brew. I didn't really sleep too well, or too long for that matter, but I woke up feeling like I could go ahead and finish the new day. As I went through that day, the `afterglow' quickly faded away and I was just left with a groggy feeling, but it wasn't too bad at all.
