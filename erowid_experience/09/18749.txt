We had spent the evening on various different strains of mushrooms, powdered and mixed into honey.  The 4 of us were feeling wonderful and close hugging each other and feeling like family.  We went into B's bedroom to hang out for a bit when B brought up something I had found myself dreaming about for almost a year since I heard a poem about it at burning man last year.  At that time I didn't really know the difference between 5-MeO-DMT and DMT but it didn't really matter.  I was SCARED!  My heart was pounding and it was only made worse to see how rather than being weighed out the powder was being `eyed' out (I realize how dangerous it is to `eye' out any dosage and I don't advise this method to anyone!! )  I thought I was going to have a heart attack just watching the others take their 7 minutes of other worldliness.. but.. I wanted it so badly.  I needed to know.  And then reality unraveled and existence rewound and \ldots  and I inhaled that harsh chemically tasting, heart pounding inhalation.  B was holding my hand and took the pipe. ..the vibration..



OH MY GOOOODNESS. I remember saying.. ooohh my ..gg.. I don't remember exhaling.  Just bursting out of my body.  It was as if every cell in my being opened up and released all the energy within to go for a walk in the cosmos.  I found a place where reality meets nonexistence and god holds your hand.  Your five senses are gone..  Not even a small amount of self-realization, rather a unified realization of pure love.  Of course.  I want to describe something I saw.  But I couldn't see.  Because I didn't have eyes.  Because I didn't have a body.  I was everything everywhere.  I was every bit of energy that has ever existed in any form from the beginning of time to the end.  In one place.  And I was as small as a quark and as big as all of space.  I remember knowing.  Knowing something that doesn't mean anything here.  And I remember floating somewhere looking in at it all.  And I mean everything.  Like the universe beneath me but bigger.  Stars.. or a TV screen all gone to frying bacon land.  This was when I decided to come back.  Then the room came back.  I couldn't see it yet.. Or I could but I couldn't perceive it as seeing.  I felt the most intense sensation.  `The cosmic orgasm' like 10,000 (no kidding) orgasms of the soul, all at once.  The vibration.  I could recognize it again.  I could feel again although not through my skin.  I was still floating just around my body.  But I felt B holding me and rocking and he was humming to me.  Z and B2 had come into the room at some point and glowing .. With knowing.  I had entered a threshold of understanding.  And then it was all-ok.



No fear in this drug, there's no time to fear.  While I was gone supposedly I said the word `love'.  It was about time.  My throat felt a bit scratchy and for an hour I ran around outside flapping my arms in absolute happiness and fulfillment.  Got a wave of nausea and puked though.  Well worth it.
