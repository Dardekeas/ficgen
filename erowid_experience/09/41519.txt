When I told a friend I was having problems with excessive marijuana smoking, he told me that acacia would solve the problem.  Later that same day, another friend showed up at my house and I asked him if he'd heard of acacia. He said, `I have some on me!'  A fine synchronicity indeed.



Before I indulged I felt that something big was in store.  My heart began pounding and I had a thought that this trip would be about connecting my solar plexus chakra (seat of will power) and my heart chakra (seat of love).



I inhaled two big tokes.  An intense sensation of buzzing sound and organic/geometric patterns and colors appeared.  The energy was intense and I got a message to surrender to it.  Many more messages came through next.



I realized that in many ways a weak will has caused intellectual and energetic stagnation in my life for the past few years.  Too much pot smoking certaintly doesn't help with motivation!  I realized that an intestinal condition I've had for the past 3 years was directly connected to this stagnation and the pain there released itself!



I felt heat \& energy in my solar plexus and as this chakra opened I could feel that this is where I have been blocked.  I received the message that I can bring my excess mental energy DOWN to my heart \& my excess sexual energy UP to it.  



Another message:  the only thing I need to concern myself with is to radiate from this heart center \& live in the moment, as everything else will blossom from that.  I have recently made big changes in my life (quit corporate job \& am freelancing from a forest cabin) and though it was a rough transition, I am now very happy and in awe of how cool my life has become.  Radiating from the heart will not be difficult.



I decided to meditate \& focus on the color green, which is the color for the heart chakra.  I then saw two infinity symbols radiating from my heart, in the shape of a 4-leaf clover.  I am mostly Irish by heritage and have been identifying with this symbol lately.  It's my avatar on online messageboards!  I have also been reaching out to my ancestors in meditation.  I realized this symbol is ancient and powerful as it can help me remember my heart!  



This also happened the day after St. Patrick's Day\ldots
