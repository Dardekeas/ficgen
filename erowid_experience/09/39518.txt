When my dentist told me I had to get my lower Wisdom Teeth removed I had to pretend not to be excited.  A few years earlier I had my upper wisdom teeth removed, and was given Nitrous during the procedure and given heavy pain medication for the days afterwards.  When I was in the chair the first time, I took many heavy hits through my nose and within a few minutes achieved liftoff.  I stared at the painting of a European garden in front of me.  I visualized that I was floating into the red wooden doorway behind various vines and plants.  Thoughts flowed through my mind as I heard distant crushing, drilling and other horrible sounds.  I didn't care because I was listening to Jerry Garcia and David Grisman on headphones.  The pain that followed the next couple of days was not as bad as my sisters before me played it out to be, although puking blood is not fun, the pills were good as gold.



The next visit to the oral surgeon was for my lower Wisdom Teeth.  This time I brought The Beatles -- Magical Mystery Tour (good time).  Before he started up the nozzle, I wanted to make sure the pain medication he gave me this time was stronger, so I acted like last time the meds didn't do it for me.  He nodded and smiled, and luckily I got me some oxycodone for the week ahead (thanks doc).  Once the nitrous started flowing and I began to breathe heavily I started to feel a peaceful sensation, but pretended not to.  I asked him to turn it up\ldots he agreed.  So I then began to listen to the album and kicked back for the free and totally legal ride.



During the procedure I focused on many visions and thoughts that drifted through my head.  I enjoyed the music while peacefully half sleeping in a dream like state.  All of a sudden I began to think about the Nitrous and the air I was breathing.  I wondered why the entire surface of the world had the proper equation of oxygen to other gasses for humans, plants and animals to live.  How could it be so perfect?  How does nature seem to be so complex while beautifully flawless.  I came to the conclusion that the mathematical ratios and equations that make it possible for life to exist is the essence of God.  I also realize that the perfect anatomy of plants and animals is so insanely complex that evolution alone might not be responsible.  Perhaps God evolved each living thing in this world. Everything in the Universe was created at one point, and I could not think of any other way it could have been created.  My mind was blown.



Then I began to think that I was very, very stoned.  In my peaceful state I cleared my head of all those thoughts, began to focus on the music.  Strawberry Fields Forever began to play.  I was having a damn good time in my own dimension that I didn't mind the drilling and crushing going on between my ears.  I stared at the poll that held up the light and found its three dimensional shadowing quite fascinating.  Then I saw a face in an electrical socket on the far wall.  Crazy shit indeed.



Once he turned off my Nitrous the feeling began to fade.  I went home and got my prescription filled.  I iced my swollen face and played some videogames.  I've been smoking weed since Freshman year of high school, and I've tried some mystery brownies at concerts, but the peaceful relaxation I experienced while under Nitrous was unique, like a mix between being stoned and say dreaming.  Less intense and more brief than a couple of gravity bong hits, but peaceful like the period right after a long sleep.
