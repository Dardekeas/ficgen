A recent pharmacological entree proved to be quite the A ticket ride, so I thought I would pass along my reccomendations. We started off with the classic combination of bees and gees (his 24mg 2c-b + 3g GHB, hers 16mg + 2.4 GHB) and then proceded to enjoy many hours of tantric delights. Oooo la la. Such a catalyst for sexual intamacy! Old Lion Balls has quite a ferocious appetite. Set in exotic African grasslands and the rolling hills of a soft goose down comforter, the Lioness called forth her mate in temptation.



`Little Lion\ldots '



`Little Lion\ldots '



`Ohh, Little Lion.'



You drive me crazy baby.



As the bees began to decline we decided to spark up some cannabis and take a double dip into the bee hive. At about T + 5 hours after the first dose of 2c-b we took another full dose of 2c-b followed by more GHB about a half hour later.



WOW! the second dose of bees provided something extraordinary. It was if the rich psychedelicness of the bees was allowed to come through full force. The body had been cleared, all the emotions and feelings played out, and now there was just a rich, lush, archetype imagery in stillness. The bees had landed! It was much more than I had expected, hehe\ldots  isnt that always the way it iz with such drugs? always exceeding the known expectation. Tasty indeed\ldots 



If you have the time, try the double dip. I know I was pleasantly surprized\ldots
