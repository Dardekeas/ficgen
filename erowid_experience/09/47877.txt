So I sit in my chair.  Take a hit.  Lose all ability to control my self as I see everything start to break apart by each individual atom.  I have music playing so that I can have some sort of connection with the real world.  After 5 seconds, I find that it doesn't matter.  Within 1 minute all I know is my breathing and a wonderful feeling all through my body.  I try to focus on breathing, impossible.  



Next thing I know, I'm on the ground, vomit bursts out my mouth as I reach for the toilet which seems miles away.  I lay on the toilet as everything begins to come back together and I feel as though I ate a load of acid and everything is some what melting back together.  My body aches, my face feels as though I will never smile again and it is slowly falling off.  I end up feeling so shitty and I see that my legs are all beat up and scratched with blood on them. Don't know why, so I take a shower.  



I sit there for about 10 minutes still waiting for the world to fully connect and become solid again.  Once out of the shower I walk out side of my room and into the living room to see three friends staring wild eyed at me and I say, `If I new I was going to just pass out, throw up and then want to kill my self, I'd stick to herb.'  Well it turns out\ldots this is what happened (That is what I remember, I do not remember any of what is below, this is an account from my roommate and friends).



I took the hit, started to breathe real heavily.  My roommate leaves my room, where two other male friends and a female where sitting waiting to find out how this drug was.  Then, they hear me screaming from my room very excitedly and they hear banging and I am yelling at the top of my lungs `I am free!!!!' and when my room mate comes back in, he sees everything in my room thrown around and I am on the ground spinning round and round hitting my body into everything imaginable.  I have dents in my wall on the corner from my head.  



My other two friends come and try to restrain me so that I do not hurt my self, I give them the look of death and my entire body is bright red and my eyes are bulging out of my sockets.  I then go through every single emotion possible.  As they try to hold me down I try and pull away from them down a hall way in my room towards the bathroom, they are unable to hold me down, or restrain me.  I supposedly have supper human strength\ldots  (They just didn't know I've been working out lol ;) I make it to my bathroom where I squeeze my self in between the toilet and the bathtub still screaming it seems, but this time I was yelling something about pairs.  



Finally they where able to get me back in the hall way some how and the two friends left the room and the other original friend stayed until I was calm.  Supposedly laying on my back tapping my toe to the music.  At this point, I am guessing this where I came too and reached forward towards the toilet.  I have no memory at all of any of this.  Honestly.  I don't recommend it.  It was no fun because what good is all that happened if `I' wasn't there to experience it or get anything from it.  Also, I think I may have just been given way too much to smoke for my mind and body to handle.  



In the end, my shoulders were bleeding and my shins, and I had bruises on my thighs and two huge ones on my lower back on both sides, my head was fucking killing me and I hope I didn't cause brain damage\ldots although I can still add, so things are looking up.  My elbows and arms were scratched up and I felt like shit inside.  It was fun for the first 5 seconds, and then\ldots I just don't recommend this crap. Plenty of better drugs out there.  Good day.
