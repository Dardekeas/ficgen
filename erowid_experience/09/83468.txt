I am a generally conscience person when it comes to RC's.  I know there power and have learned that abusing them is `foolish'.



I had been working with MDPV for a few weeks when I decided to smoke it.  The first hit was about 3mgs.  I noticed that when eaten or snorted the effects were mildly euphoric and stimulating but when smoked the euphoria was doubled and the speedyness was less.  I took a couple redoses and decided to ingest 5mgs of Phenazapam.  It hit me in about 30 minutes and was very relaxed.  I was nodding off and woke with the idea to take another hit.  This time it was about 5mgs.  The effects were something Io have never experanced.  I was nodding still to WSOP and was in a state of complete euphoria.  The only thing I can compare it to is heroin. I would wake from my experance periotically to redose and go back to bed.  I fell asleep shortly and had no hangover to speak of the next day.



Very good experance 3+.   :)
