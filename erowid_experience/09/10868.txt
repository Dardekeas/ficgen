This past fall I came across a steady, cheap source of highly potent psilocybes.  Having had much experience with oral ingestion a friend and I decided to discover for ourselves the effects of inhaled mushrooms.  We crumbled a fairly even mix of caps and stems and  packed a six foot bong three times each.  The effects were almost immediate, though completely unlike eating mushrooms.  The experience is very similar to that of high grade MJ, except that it's more potent, colors are more vivid, and there tends to be a very `spacey' aspect to it.  The smoke is harsh, the taste is horrible, and unfortunately it sticks around.  The experience lasts only a few hours.  Following further experimentation we discovered that the caps are more potent (and harsher on the lungs) and make for a great intensifier for MJ.  Also it should be noted that after eating 3 grams of the fungus and waiting about 15 minutes, smoking some of the same batch catapulted me into the full fledged tripping experience, visuals et al.  The only negative side effect I'm aware of is stronger lung irritation than with most smokes.
