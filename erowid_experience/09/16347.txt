I got pretty drunk off budlight last night, and while we were out getting munchies I picked up a bottle of delsym. We went back to the party and smoke a decent joint.  I downed the bottle of delsym on the way home from the party.  It seemed like there was incredible pressure on my face and skull for a while.  While waiting for the full effects of the delsym to kick in I put some internet radio on, and played counter strike. As my head buzz grew stronger and stronger I played worse and worse.  I decided to go lay down.



That was about 5 hours ago.  I just woke up with an incredible sense of smell.  I haven't ever been able to smell things so sensitively in my life.  The smell of the joint we smoked last night is incredibly overwhelming, I smell my girlfriends pussy somehow, and the chapstick she wears.  My rooms smells really dusty.  I almost need to sneeze.  I'm also having a hard time typing right now.  I keep leaving letters off, and then I have to go back and type them in later.  I kind of just hope this all goes away soon.  I'm going back to bed to try and sleep it off.
