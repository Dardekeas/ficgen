 \#\#EROWID\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\#  



Well we got onto the interstate and that's when it began to get worse everything was moving so fast and moving side to side. If you have ever seen the documentary film, called Most High about a man who becomes addicted to crystal meth, the scene when he is driving on the interstate and his perception is basically shot to hell, well that's how I saw everything basically exactly the same as he did. Basically everything was blurry, and I was very speedy, also everything was moving side to side very rapidly and things began to partially melt. I felt extremely paranoid and began rambling on about the cop's again and how I was almost 100\% positive the cop knew where I lived and he was going be waiting for me at my house or waiting around the corner waiting to nail me for anything he could.  I even put 20 bucks on it, but luckily my friends are not douche bags and they knew I was just out of it and didn't make me pay up.



When we got back to my house D and A got in A's car and went back to D's, I chose to stay home because I felt so wired, I went inside and talked to my mother from about 2:00 A.M. till 5:00 A.M. My mother and I are best friend's you could say, we've been through a lot of bullshit together that honestly neither of us deserve especially her and if you are reading this, I Love you Mom! I went upstairs and I was lying in my bed with the lights off and I thought Dragons yet again were flying in my window, crawling on my wall and eating me.  I thought spiders were running on me as well and I tried to kill them, but obviously nothing was there. I thought well maybe if I smoke some more it will knock me out\ldots.. Well I was wrong.



Prior to this experience I would smoke Damiana to help me with insomnia and it worked, but not with the ivory in my system. Instantly it brought the Meth, crack, and coke feeling back again and the intense hallucinations also came back and they didn't knock on the door this time or ask to come in, they just charged right on in and they came in hard.  I saw cavemen hitting each other over their heads with clubs on my TV (and it was off), I saw an assembly line of tiny Gorillas flying around my head, and for about 10 minutes I stared at a blank piece of loose-leaf paper and thought cartoons were being played on it.  As I was sitting on my couch in my room after about 10 minutes after I smoked I heard my door trying to be forced open (hallucination) as well as I heard my father screaming my name and I thought it was coming from outside my window. He passed from lung cancer the day after my 18th birthday last April 3rd 2010, I Love and miss you Dad!



I obviously knew that this was also a hallucination, but I still looked out the window hoping to see him and it was about 6:00 A.M. and I did not see my father, but I could have sworn I saw my neighbor across the street pointing a .12 gauge shot gun at this man who had done garden work for him, so I ran downstairs and as I was running down the stairs I heard shots and a loud thump. I went outside and of course no one was there. My mom sleeps on the couch in our living room so when she heard the door close behind me she woke up and came outside, my mother became suspicious I had done something else as well as smoke that night when I began to ramble on about how that asshole killed him and brought his dead body in the house and that I told her to call the police and when she asked ``Why'' I said ``because that prick just shot his Gardner and dragged his body inside you don't see the blood all on the driveway?'' She looked at me as if I was insane and I realized I was hallucinating yet again.  O fuck I thought to myself and started to walk back inside. O yea I forgot to mention I don't know about snorting but when consumed through drinking it's like fucking truth serum. Well I began to  pour out my emotions and all that good stuff which resulted in me telling her what I was really on, I was so wired and was speeding so fast and it sounded like I was drunk as well, so hold on a minute and picture this, a rapid talking drunk whose eyes are dilated to where you cannot tell that they were blue and they were red as can be and well, That's me!



After this little dilemma I went upstairs and layed down in bed at about 6:30A.M. And guess what? I had work at 10:00 A.M. (in four hours) and I was tripping my ass off still, I had to call in sick and didn't go to sleep until about 2:00 P.M. the next after noon.  It would hurt to keep my eyelids closed which resulted in me lying in my bed wondering when I would be able to close my eyes. So on hour 30 of no sleep I felt like my brain was fried or a better term zapped; I would slur words very badly and fumble up words and could not get out what I wanted to say no matter how hard I concentrated on saying it and I thought at the time that I would be like that the rest of my life in the state of word fumbling and word confusion I also was talking in a different tone than I usually would. When I say word fumbling I mean for example I would say mop instead of broom, or plane instead of car etc.  I managed to somehow stumble to my laptop and preceded to Google Ivory Wave Bath Salt\ldots\ldots.and guess what? Well if you already knew or you somehow guessed and I kid you not when I say I bought synthetic cocaine-like drug from a fucking gas station!!! I had watched a documentary about the use of Meth in America the day before ironically and the high I had was comparable to meth from what I saw in the video.



I didn't really have a comedown I just didn't sleep for 35 hours and my brain was fried from not sleeping. I guess you could call it a comedown because I felt pretty shitty. I also noticed my heart rate drastically slowed down as I was laying in bed\ldotsto the point where I could not feel it beating anymore\ldots.I began to wonder that if I would see my dad soon and thought I was going to die and I felt it begin to beat yet again.  I finally went to sleep at 2:00 P.M. Sunday afternoon and woke up at 4:00 P.M. and I did not get much sleep the next night either which resulted in me missing class so on Monday so that I could sleep all day. And that's how the night I tried to surf the Ivory Wave, I got caught in the under toe and almost drowned\ldots\ldots..
