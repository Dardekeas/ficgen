I'm in high school, and had a really busy week ahead of me. My teachers had booked at least a test every day of the week, and I was way behind on notes. In other words, I needed a miracle.

My friend hooked me up with three 30 mg adderalls, and my other friend gave me two 50 mg vyvanse. I went to CVS to buy no-doz. Then the fun began. I woke up at 8:00 am sunday morning, and pulled an all-nighter no problem that night without taking a single drug. Monday during the day, I started crashing. I snuck into the bathroom and cut one of the adderall in half, and blew the 15 mg line. In 5 minutes my fatigue was washed away, and everything was almost severely clear. 

I went to pull another all-nighter that night, blowing the rest of the 15 mg that I had left. I finished a giant chunk of my work with no problems. I was alert and my teeth were grinding a little, and I hadn't eaten since saturday. Things continued well and good until Thursday night. I still hadn't slept or eaten yet, and I went to the bathroom only once a day to pee for about 3 minutes.

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday were much the same. No sleep, more adderall, no significant problems. Thursday night, amphetamine psychosis set it. The caffeine pills were causing this obnoxious buzzing noise in my head, and every shadow became an enemy. Things in my room became animated. I chain-smoked three packs of cigarettes to calm down. At 4 AM I emerged from a sort of trance state, 300 feet into the woods behind my house. It was raining. I was barefoot and shirtless. My biology textbook was on my head, and I was holding a flashlight under my chin. I have, to this day, zero recollection of ever going outside. I began to tremble, and my head became unbearable heavy. I popped my last vyvanse and went to school on friday. 

This, ladies and gentlemen, was the worst day of my life. The people in the hallway melted into an amorphous blob that threatened to swallow me. Time moved equal parts slow and fast. The muscles in my back and arms began to slowly stiffen, like they were turning to stone. My eyes stung so badly and were so dry that blinking was excruciating. I broke three pencils because I was shaking so hard. Loud noises caused me to bury my face and hide. I didn't know who I was, where I was. Everything was terrifyingly unfamiliar. The bell ringing almost made my heart stop, and the legs of every desk began to sway. It started to feel like the air was gelatinous, and moving became an unbelievable effort.

Thinking I needed to come down from the amphetamine high, I went to a friend's after school to smoke some weed. After one bowl, I felt my blood pressure skyrocket. The tension in my veins was unbearable, and I kept hallucinating that my skin was bursting open from the pressure exerted on my blood vessels. The world began to blur in and out of focus. I drank a bottle of water, took 2 tylenol PM, and passed out.

My friend reported that I was sleep walking for about half an hour. I would wake up periodically, laughing and crying almost simultaneously. I also was told that I sat bolt upright screaming three times, as if I'd had a bad nightmare. I sweat through her sheets. Everything was soaked. I then slept for 15 hours straight. I smelled awful, I looked like absolute hell, and it felt like I'd been hit by a bus. 

Honestly, amphetamines are fine for one all-nighter or recreational use. But I was awake for about 135 hours straight. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
