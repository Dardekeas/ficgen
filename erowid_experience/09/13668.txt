I've tried AMT (alphamethyltryptamine) about 10 times in the past but always with higher doses.  I noticed that at 50mg the negative effects, 24 hour insomnia, unbearable body load, heavy perspiration, and uncomfortable nausea, made it not worth it to even take the drug.  I figured maybe half the dose would give almost the same positive effects without the extreme negatives.



5pm: poured out a capsule of 25mg in water and drank solution. I also swallowed the gelcap in order to intake the leftover powder in the capsule.



5:45: began feeling a warm fuzzy feeling encompassing my body but mainly as sweat beginning at my forehead.



7pm:  still am not peaking however the visuals have just begin to appear.  Very mild but nonetheless visuals.



8pm:  I think I have hit the peak:  laughter comes very easy, peoples' faces are very distored and my face looks as though I am breaking out, however, my face always looks like that whenever I trip.



The experience was mild, I can still talk to my parents, however I have to watch what I say because the truth seems to slip out a lot easier.



2am:  After drinking half a fifth of Soco and smoking some herb I find it very easy to fall asleep.



7am:  Wake up the next morning feeling hung over from the alcohol rather than the AMT\ldots . I think that is a good thing.



The point of my experience was just to see if a low dose of AMT was worth ingesting.  It definately was.  I had a 7 hour trip and was able to fall asleep, not act too stupid, and did not experience any come down whatsoever.  Therefore, I recommend for first time users to start at a low dose, ie. 20-25 mg orally ingested and seeing what it does, then moving up depending on how hard you want to trip and how much negative effects you can stand.
