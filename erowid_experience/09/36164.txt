While part of a very serious class of drugs, Codeine is not a very powerful drug. Although, it can have some strange and unpredictable effects on some people.  I'm one of them.



I had been diagnosed with a common sinus infection. I was given Augementon, an antibiotic, for the infection and Cherratussin for the sinus headache commonly associated with sinus problems. Now, Cherratussin is a liquid prescription containing 10 mg of Codeine and 100 mg of Guaifenesin per 10 ml (1 Teaspoon). I had experimented lightly with Codeine in the past so I had a little knowledge as to the dosage. The instructions told me to take two teaspoons every four to six hours as needed. Now anyone who has experienced the effects of Codeine would know that this isn't enough to get my grandmother buzzed, lot less take away any pain.



Well I wasn't in the best mind state when this experience took place. Between the people around me and the environment I was living in, it was all taking a toll on me and really had my nerves shot. After reading Codeine not only relieves pain but can cause mood lift and even relaxation, three things I had not experienced in a while, I decided that I was going to use this for what it was intended for and for recreational use at the same time.



After reading some things I decided that 50 mg was a good place to start off after not using this drug in such a while. I took 50 mg once daily for about five days continuously. I really wasn't getting ``high'' of it. But when I first swallowed the fowl liquid I would feel a very strong feeling of excitement and laughter, and I would twitch a lot. Now I'm not sure if this was a psychological effect, a physical effect, or a combination. Within about 2-4 minutes this would be gone but could kind of feel my self slowly creeping up the beginning of the ``roller coaster ride'' of excitement and relaxation I was in for. Then I would feel a slight buzz when I would be ``peaking''. I did however experience a very large mood lift and after about T+1:00 extreme relaxation. I would turn off the lights and turn on some quiet Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony and just sit in my chair trying to sing along with the music. As described with other psychoactive drugs I felt a deeper connection to the music. I would do this for about 3 hours every night for the five days I did this.



Well on the fifth night I noticed that I was almost out and only had about 100 mg remaining. So ignoring the fact that my nightly ``break'' from life was about to be over with I took my usual 50 mg. Well I sat around for about 30-45 minutes when I decided I would take the rest. Now the feeling I described feeling right after taking it was intensified by about 1000. I was happy, sad, terrified, excited, and relaxed all at one moment. I just wanted to scream, laugh, and cry all at one moment. As for the twitching I described earlier, instead of a random extremity moving an inch or two in a random direction my arms were waving around like a pi√±ata, I would lean forward, backward, side to side, if it was controlled by voluntary muscle then it was probably moving.



It was so strange, thoughts of overdose started racing through my head. I know Codeine in high doses can cause respiratory failure. I was panicking thinking I was going to die. I couldn't make up my mind as to whether I wanted to sit on the porch, in the living room, in my room, whether I wanted to lie down, sit down, stand up. It was basically a small nervous break down. Then two minutes later I was fine just chillin watching a movie having a little more intense version of my usual. Only this time I never felt my period of excitement after my ``adrenaline rush from hell'' I went straight to a relaxed state and lasted that way for about 3 hours.



All in all I find Codeine a light somewhat easy to get a hold up opiate that can really give me a break from life. I am now out of Codeine, my sinus infection is gone, and I don't plan to use any opiates for at least a month. As for my last experience with Codeine I can not explain it, and do not understand how something as weak as Codeine managed to creep up on me like it did. I would not call it a bad trip, definitely a difficult experience for the first time but if I knew what to expect it would be a great recreational experience.



Peace, until next time\ldots
