I've been investigating methipropamine as a study drug, so far it seems leagues above ritalin in that it gives no comedown, or other aftereffects. About the same 6 hour duration too. Shame it's completely unresearched, but having used it 6/7 days last week there seem to be no noticeable aftereffects, which is always a good sign.



Have used between 30-70mg/day in the last week, and have settled on 35mg +15mg as great for 5+ hours of solid theory work, followed by 3-4 hours of still increased attentiveness. 



35mg typically comes up within 20-30 minutes, providing an ideal level of stimulation until t+2, after which it begins to tail off, the effects are not particularly noticeable after t+4 but effects do seem to remain until around t+6. Taking after a large meal seems to reduce the effect by about 25\% but doubled the effective time, removing the need to redose.



Redosing twice (35+20+15 and 25+15+20) seems to cause stomach discomfort resembling trapped air. Neither cannabis or anything else seems to shake it, but it is relatively minor. 



Not much appetite suppression at this level, no need to eat but perfectly able to, no need to snack as I work like I normally do to excess. There does seem to be a certain amount of mild time dilation, in that I am not particularly aware of the passing of time and am unable to guess it nearly as well as normal.



All ROAs oral, measured with a decent lab balance.
