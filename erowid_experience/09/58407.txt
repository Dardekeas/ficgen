DMT/5-MeO-DMT Administration Session 

Audio Tape Transcript 

(DMT isolated from Maiden's Wattle and smoked) 

11.10AM, Saturday 8/6/02



SETTING



SUBJECT sitting in well-lit room on large bed, arranged with pillows for comfortable reclining. Two large sliding windows with light curtains half-drawn leading to verandah, sunlight filtering through from the East. Stationary ceiling fan directly above the bed, white sloping ceiling, walls painted with pink-red textured paint, to the right of SUBJECT is a full-length sliding double mirror/wardrobe, in front of which sits ASSISTANT on wheeled office chair. Tape recorder lying at side of bed, distance between SUBJECT and ASSISTANT is some three metres (hence occasional inaudibility of ASSISTANT on recording). In the days prior to the session, SUBJECT had been reading literature on DMT trance and South American shamanic experience (Harner et. al.).



Time intervals in minutes and seconds are measured from point of drug administration. In the latter descriptive phase of the session, time intervals are generally only given when certain physiological or psychological effects of the drug are still apparent in the dialogue (see Symptomatic Timeline at end of transcription).

[euphoric laughter]

+8.08 SUBJECT: I'm trying to talk to you but it's really difficult\ldots

[euphoric laughter]

[chuckling]

[heavy breathing]



+8.48 SUBJECT: You see now it's just a memory.

[ASSISTANT inaudible]

SUBJECT: No, it doesn't.

SUBJECT: I'm just going to try to recall what I saw, but it's really difficult\ldots

+9.02 SUBJECT: Oh, it's going already.

SUBJECT: Would you mind getting me some lemonade?

SUBJECT: I think there might be some downstairs\ldots oh, no, here it is here actually\ldots

ASSISTANT: [passes lemonade]

SUBJECT: Could you close the door? 

ASSISTANT: [closes door]

SUBJECT: Thanks, ASSISTANT\ldots

ASSISTANT: You still remember my name!



+9.39 SUBJECT: The first couple of seconds\ldots or whatever it was\ldots um\ldots The first thing I saw was the room disintegrating, or it was becoming really fine in its texture somehow, everything, the whole of my visual field, and then it was just\ldots this shattering, just like a shattering\ldots a shattering of this fabric\ldots and then I just had to lie down, because I realised that it was really powerful\ldots then I was looking at the ceiling\ldots and I still have a little bit of the sense of it now\ldots um\ldots and there was something really frightening, and incredibly powerful, and not deathly frightening in the sense of\ldots it was a benevolent spirit, but it had such incredible power, um\ldots so you don't have to understand what I'm saying [laughter]\ldots The funny thing was that I said, I think I recall saying, it's a medicine man, and then I looked towards you, and then it was you who was the medicine man, and then there was this incredible\ldots [sigh] \ldotsThis beautiful halo around you, and it was like the whole thing which I'd seen from the beginning, it was like a geometric pattern, which it's probably best to draw rather than to explain\ldots um\ldots 



[ASSISTANT passes pen and paper] 

SUBJECT: Oh thanks, great\ldots and anyway, this\ldots 

[SUBJECT draws on paper] 

+12.14 SUBJECT: Just making it very quickly, you were there, and there was this\ldots [euphoric laughter]\ldots there was this, so that's what it looked like, in the most basic way, that's your face, and there was this\ldots and they were like this\ldots um\ldots interlocking red ribbons moving in a circle. The really important thing was what I saw before, and I cannot recall it exactly, but there was something\ldots I could see hearts, like love hearts, and these red ribbons again, these interlocking red ribbons\ldots [heavy sigh] \ldotsand it was this guy, he was a male, and there were cats, and there were females there too, maybe the cats were the females, and there were love hearts, really sounds like a Cure song [laughter], but it was both visual and\ldots um\ldots and it was someone communicating to me, and it was this shaman, this medicine man, but he was really\ldots and he was showing me something, but he was just showing me his own mind, I think, and it was really frightening, I mean the things that were in his mind were like\ldots it was like a hell realm, there was something hellish about it but incredibly seductive, in the sense that there was this feminine thing there, all oranges and reds, all oranges and reds\ldots there was this sort of cat, female cat\ldots um\ldots



ASSISTANT: Was it a big cat?

SUBJECT: Um\ldots my idea was there were lots of domestic cats, and it wasn't a big cat like a jaguar, and I hadn't even thought of a jaguar until I said it now, obviously it might have formed some sort of expectation, because I'd read about jaguars\ldots but this was someone communicating to me in spirit form\ldots I wish I could remember it\ldots

ASSISTANT: You said it was too beautiful to describe.

SUBJECT: Yeah, it still is\ldots I wish I could remember it\ldots I can remember it\ldots

ASSISTANT: You said it was a dying shaman\ldots

SUBJECT: I saw him on the wall, that's right! Yes! thank you ASSISTANT [laughter], I saw him on the wall, and he was lying in a swamp of blood, it was like blood, and he had skulls all around, it was like he was lying on this morass of bodies in a swamp, there was blood instead of water, and the skulls were all around his head like a halo, and they were covered with vomit, this orange vomit, which was coming out of their eyes\ldots [sigh] \ldotsand that's it, that was all there was\ldots [heavy breathing] \ldotsbut it was the most benevolent thing, you know, and benevolent because of the power\ldots it's as if, you know, I could do this, but I choose not to. It's like\ldots absolute benevolence\ldots absolute benevolence\ldots it was orange and red, and there were circulating patterns, asymmetrical circulating patterns\ldots 



It was as though there was a consciousness there as well\ldots [heavy breathing]\ldots In a sense the power was the ability to contain the horror, there was such an intense horror at the heart, but it wasn't really the heart, because somehow there was consciousness there as well, and it was like ``Here consciousness is standing, in the midst of this, and it's not\ldots it's triumphant, the consciousness is there, but it's not succumbing to this horror, it's not afraid, it's just standing there and watching, it's the master of this\ldots and it can show other people the same horror, and through mastering it, it becomes incredibly powerful\ldots it becomes\ldots it has this amazing power\ldots but it chooses not to manifest this power\ldots it chooses\ldots it's this incredible benevolence, it's as if somehow benevolence was synonymous with consciousness\ldots. it's\ldots that's really it\ldots

[sigh]

It's just a matter of concrete [inaudible], I mean that sounds ridiculous, I'm just trying to explain what I saw, I'm not trying to pronounce or anything, I'm really just trying to explain what I saw\ldots



+21.16 ASSISTANT: Was the consciousness the shaman's consciousness?

SUBJECT: It was mine as well as the shaman's, it was the shaman showing me this, then somehow I\ldots then I was transported into the mind of the shaman, I was seeing exactly the same things, it was like the shaman was showing me this, and this was medicine for me\ldots it was medicine for me\ldots this was the medicine\ldots I'm remembering it as I go there\ldots this was the medicine, I mean this was the benevolence of it, this was a medicine that was being given to me, to make me\ldots better, to heal me in some way\ldots. Um\ldots what did you ask?

ASSISTANT: Was your consciousness the shaman's consciousness?

SUBJECT: Yeah, I think it became mine, I think it was the shaman showing this level of consciousness, that's how it was, because then I was seeing the dying shaman, and he was lying there in this pool of blood, this swamp\ldots uh\ldots

ASSISTANT: Was he breathing heavily?

SUBJECT: Uh\ldots he was dead, he was lying there, it looked like he was lifeless, he was covered in blood, and he was just at the point of dying, the light was flickering out of his eyes, he wasn't moving, and it was like his eyes were just beginning to glaze over.



ASSISTANT: Did he have a particular ethnicity?

SUBJECT: Yeah, he was South American, he was a South American guy, an Indian, a native American\ldots [laughter] \ldotsit's hard to believe, maybe its just because of what I've been reading, but he was fucking there, on the fucking wall\ldots. 

The things I saw before I saw him, that was incredible\ldots

ASSISTANT: You make it sound rather abstract\ldots

SUBJECT: I know, I know\ldots this is the thing, they're incredibly visual and real, but they sound totally abstract as I translate them into words, I can hear that\ldots and it sounds like, it must sound clichéd, or it must sound\ldots but this is what I saw, and the point being, that the visuality of it was so tied up with its meaning, that I could see things moving around the [ceiling] fan here, and again it was these ribbons of light, of red or orange or yellow light, and it was all very suggestive of delirium when you're sick, of being in hospital and you're sick and you become delirious\ldots and\ldots [sigh] \ldotsand then there was this\ldots this pattern was moving around\ldots this fucking propeller [the ceiling fan, the word had temporarily escaped the SUBJECT's recollection]\ldots 



and um\ldots that was when the horror began, it was a horror, that was when I was beginning to see this realm, and there were love hearts within these ribbons which were moving in these circles, and I can't recall exactly what I saw, I just remember vaguely that I saw lots of cats, lots of domestic cats, and there was something female there, associated with these shapes, and um\ldots there was this terrible fear, and something really horrible\ldots a lot more happened, but I wasn't here to know, I mean, I can hardly recall it, and I can't bring it back completely, maybe if one masters the drug in some way, maybe if one was raised with such an incredible thing, one could recall it all better\ldots it was like voodoo as well, I don't know why it was like voodoo, but that's something that came to mind\ldots and there was this black fur\ldots and this pattern\ldots and a feminine power of some sort\ldots what was the other question you were going to ask? Because I've lost\ldots



ASSISTANT: [inaudible: concerning beginning of experience]

+27.31 SUBJECT: I mean it was immediate, as soon as I smoked, everything became incredibly sharp, and then it was as if I was moving backwards really rapidly, everything became very linear\ldots so do you know Adobe Paintshop, which I have, I'll show it to you later, the best way to describe it is not when you pointillize an image, but when you `Find Edges'\ldots It sharpens the image and it actually makes lines\ldots

And then, um\ldots I think I recall saying, ``this is real South American stuff'', did I say that?

ASSISTANT: [inaudible]

+29.20 SUBJECT: Yeah, that's what I was trying to say\ldots it's as if there was some doubt in my mind that this stuff was very powerful\ldots

ASSISTANT: Yeah, I think that was one of the very first things you said, was that [inaudible]

SUBJECT: Yeah, I think that's when I handed it [the pipe] to you, when I realised there was no way I was going to be able to take a second toke, because I was very rapidly losing motor control, and I had to lie down\ldots 



I saw plants\ldots I saw plants in a valley\ldots you see now it's difficult\ldots I saw plants in a valley, and the plants were the medicine, and this was the medicine man giving me the plants, it was so simple\ldots it's as if I just read it out of a book, out of a shaman book, you know, Harner's stuff\ldots [laughter]

Do you want to go for a walk? 

ASSISTANT: Would you like to go for a walk?

+31.00 SUBJECT: I wouldn't mind going for a walk, I think I've recalled as much as I can\ldots I'll just get up slowly, I'm feeling rather groggy\ldots

So was it as good for you as it was for me? [laughter]

ASSISTANT: [laughter] yes!

SUBJECT: It was really?

ASSISTANT: um\ldots no!

SUBJECT: [laughter] Oh, okay, sorry, it must have been really boring\ldots how long did it happen for, about half an hour?

ASSISTANT: Yeah.

SUBJECT: I still feel quite buzzy, and as I get up now I still feel a little bit hovery\ldots but it's a very benevolent drug, it's not like LSD\ldots



ASSISTANT: Do you want a hand up? [offers hand to SUBJECT]

SUBJECT: Oh, sorry, I thought you were going to shake my hand\ldots like Yuri Gagarin [laughter]

SUBJECT: [tries to stand] Fucking hell\ldots oh my god\ldots 

SUBJECT: Listen\ldots [sigh] \ldotsum\ldots should I say anything more before I forget? Maybe I'll actually recall more now if I do go out and just wander, because I've got a lot of stuff on the tape, but it's not very detailed, because it's difficult to remember what I saw\ldots and the shaman on the wall, he was just unbelievable\ldots and it's great that I've got these particular walls, this particular paint job, because it has these slightly structured paint brushes, which somehow made it easier, because I could see him here, but he was dark-skinned, just brown-skinned, and I don't know if he was actually pure native American or if he had some Spanish blood, I'm not sure\ldots um\ldots he might have been wearing feathers\ldots he was definitely wearing feathers, they were red and black feathers, and there was a halo of skulls, and maybe he had a necklace of bones or something, it was all very bony\ldots



The first thing I saw, that was unbelievable, but I just can't recall what it was\ldots I can see it, I can see the patterns, and it was as if they were coming into my body, they were circulating around the fan and coming into me as well, it was really\ldots the orangeness of it, they were changing from red to orange to yellow, and if you can imagine nausea being expressed visually, it was like nausea, but then there was this consciousness there, which was this female, that appeared like a cat\ldots I saw lots of cats in some way, they were in a darkened room, and within the room there were these red ribbons of light moving in circles and waves, very serpentine\ldots but what I saw then, that was\ldots I can't say what it was\ldots

ASSISTANT: That was the horror which the shamanic consciousness surmounts?

SUBJECT: No, that wasn't the horror.. the horror was this thing which I was being shown\ldots

ASSISTANT: For the cats?



SUBJECT: With the cats\ldots with the cats, but when I saw the shaman\ldots but first it was the cats, but I didn't really see cats, it was just this room with patterns going around the fan, but there were cats there [laughter], don't ask me how, they weren't hallucinated cats, they were hallucinated love hearts and ribbons of red and orange and yellow light which were segmented like worms, and they were moving in this way around your head like this, and it was more complicated because there were some here around your chest, and the funny thing was that I could see them in the mirror\ldots

ASSISTANT: In the mirror? [laughter]

SUBJECT: In the mirror, from behind\ldots that's the really funny thing, there was a symmetry to them when looking at them from the front, but they were reflected perfectly in the mirror, it wasn't the same image, it was a reflected image\ldots Then it was like, ``well, there's no point talking to you, because you are the medicine man'' [laughter], I mean it was the same medicine man, that's the whole point. And I could see the medicine, and it was this plant, and it was expressed in these visual patterns\ldots and I saw this valley, where the plant is gathered. 

That's about all I can remember\ldots

+38.34 (11.49AM)



FURTHER OBSERVATIONS BY THE SUBJECT



- The onset of drug action (which was instantaneous, dramatic and startling) and the break-up of the visual field may have had an auditory concomitant, something akin to the sound of plastic film being torn.

- The visual hallucinations in the first 4 and a half minutes (accompanied by the exclamations ``It's the medicine man'' and ``It's too beautiful to explain'') suggested the administering of a medicine by a disembodied power, a medicine which was also a poison. The poisonous aspect of the `medicine' was very prominent. The structure of this `poison' or `medicine' appeared to be expressed in these early hallucinations, something akin to a Paracelsian `signature' possessed by the drug seemed evident in the visual patterning.

- During those early stages of the experience pertaining to the administration of a `medicine', the impression that this had happened to me before was very strong. There was an inkling of an `eternal return' in the Nietzschean sense, i.e. the impression that I was standing within a long lineage of those who had reached this juncture in their lives and taken this `medicine', and that I had discovered the same secret, or that I was in fact the same person taking this drug in an infinite succession stretching forwards and backwards in time.



- Despite the overwhelming sense of the `reality' of visions whilst within the drug-induced state, my limited researches on DMT trance and South American shamanism were clearly evident in attempts to make sense of the experience, during both the initial hallucinatory phase and the latter descriptive phase of the session.

- The symptomatic timeline detailed below suggests that the session experience was produced by the inhaled equivalent of @50-60mg DMT administered intramuscularly.

- The initial imagery directly after the onset of symptoms was remembered some seven days after the event (or at least it appeared to be `remembered'), the segmented, worm-like `ribbons' of orange, red, yellow and black were in fact snakes emerging from behind the ceiling fan, there appeared to be three or four of them, which gradually wound their way down towards me and seemed to enter my heart. This seemed to be, in part, a reflection of the notion that I had been poisoned in some way.



SYMPTOMATIC TIMELINE
