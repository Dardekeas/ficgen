I obtained some adrafinil (Olmifon) from France following some media coverage on it and modafinil which got my attention. I wasn't expecting much, given the somewhat tabloidish `party all night' slant of the articles. There was a mention that the military was switching from amphetamines to modafinil, which got me more interested. I did some research and liked what I saw. It seems that rather than being a stimulant, these drugs are a new class of drug\ldots  wakefulness promoters. I don't know of a proper name for this drug class. Maybe something catchy like vigilytics?



In any case, modafinil sounds better of the two but it is scheduled now and, if I wanted to order it in spite of the law, its insanely expensive. Adrafinil seems to be just as effective from what I read, with its main drawback being that it has a shorter duration. A dose of modafinil could keep you going for a looong time, whereas with adrafinil you'd need to keep taking the drug every 5-6 hours.



The pills came in 300mg doses. I decided to try one just to see the effect. I felt pretty much nothing that couldn't be attributed to placebo\ldots  most of the `effects' I felt were mild anxiety symptoms. I was expecting more classic stimulant effects, but there were none. I tried it on another day at 600mg and again felt nothing.



Then, I tried it when I'd been awake for over 40 hours and had some stuff I needed to do. I decided to try adrafinil, 300mg. Within a half hour, I was feeling a little more alert. Within an hour, while I still knew I was tired and was a little cloudy headed, I felt almost normally alert. When I began to feel drowsy again in about 4 or 5 hours, I took another 300mg and was soon back to near full alertness.



Adrafinil had almost zero noticable effect when taken while alert. Subsequent tests have shown that the anxiety-like effects I had the first trial were all placebo. There are no noticable effects from this drug at all when taken while sober and alert. May as well be a sugar pill. However, if taken when I am tired to the point of delerium and struggling to stay awake, it will give me a state of alertness almost as complete as if I'd had a good night's sleep. Adrafinil has no euphoric or `stimulant' effects and therefore is of zero recreational value. If you need to stay awake for many hours without sleep though, its invaluable. I definately would like to stockpile it while its legal. Shame that modafinil is now a Scheduled drug in the US and an insanely pricey drug elsewhere. I'd love to compare the two.
