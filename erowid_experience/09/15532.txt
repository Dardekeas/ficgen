Me only being 14 think this was quite and experience. Me and my best friend decided to chill and hook up on some shrooms that day. We started the day off by getting stoned of corse. And went on our mission for the wonderfull fungus. We drove back to my pad and sat down and me and my best friend split up the shrooms equally. We decided just to eat them and drink some water afterwards. I would discribe them as stale rice cakes. Within about 20 minuets me and her looked and each other and just grinned. We knew they had kicked in. We were just smiling like we were having som sort of conversation through our minds and we knew they were talking about us but all we could do was smile the 3 of them had to leave pretty soon becaus they had to go to work. Or one of them did. I didnt really know them that well but they left me and my friend went outside and were just laughing at everything. It was like everything was soo funny and the hole world was laughing with us. Out cries of laughter filled the air and we felt terrific. Small things seems like the biggest deal. And the halusinations ohhwee!! 



I went in my room becaus I had remember I was on the computer and I needed to type an away message. But every time I touched the key board all the letters turned into ants and started crawling all over my desk. As soon as my hands left the key board the ants turned back into letters. 



The hole day went pretty easily until nightfall. My dads girlfriend and my brother came home. And I was talking to her. She looked like a little mouse. Relieved that I didnt freak out around her I told my brother what we were on. My brother being the pothead he is asked for some so we gladly handed it over anxiouse to see his reaction. Within about 30 minutes he came down stairs and shouted `these are the best shrooms ever!!!!' he was trippin! He described how the walls were moving and swerling and how he felt soo good. Then my best friend started not feeling so well. She said that she felt sick and she put her head down on the table. We heard her breathing strange like she couldnt breath so we lifted her head up and she completly stopped breathing. Her face turned pale and her lips blue. My brother started smacking her to wake her up but she appeared dead. We wernt sure if we were just trippin or if it was really happening. So my brother told me to call 911 and I pannics and told him to so he rushed to the phone and called. 



I stayed there with her crying and praying she was ok (I believed in god for 10 minutes) she woke up and she said she was fine and she thought she forgot to breath. The police showed up and there was no way to play it off the rest of the night was spent in questioning and phone calls to find out parents. They took my friend to the hospital I wanted to go with her soo bad. I saw them roll her away into the ambulance and I was worried. Later she had told me she thought they were zipping up a body bag and she had died because she was still tripping. The police kept asking the same goddamn questions and I couldnt tell if I was talking to them or not. Alot of the time it felt like we were having some sort of telepathic conversation it felt that way with everyone. Despite the scary experience my friend had. I had later found out she was bipolar. I would do shrooms again. 



Long term effect? Well I still have some little trips here and there and flickering light bother me more than the norm. And I see flashes of light sometimes. But I'm looking forward to my next shrooming session. Some advice. Shroom with someone sober so if anything goes wrong u wont die!! Well my friend lived and I'm banned from seeing her but we get around that.
