Throughout my life I have sampled many drugs, however I never felt a need to get more of a drug until I tried crack.  I thought I could handle trying just about anything once. My friend had been smoking crack for a couple months and I always hassled him about it because I was worried, but he said I didn't understand because I had never tried it.  So one day my friend came over and I agreed to try it so I could maybe understand.  



Well that day all we did was smoke rock after rock, until we ran out.  Then he took out more money and we bought more crack.  I personally do not like how crack makes me feel, the only reason I continued to smoke more was because my body was telling me to.  My friend says it's the best high, I however disagree. It simply makes my heart race, ruins my attention span and it made me feel very lethargic.  

     

Smoking crack is something that will affect me for the rest of my life.  When people told me crack was highly addictive I thought `yeah, whatever, so is cocaine and I do that sometimes and never crave it.' Well there's a big difference.  My cravings to smoke crack have yet to leave me and I didn't even enjoy it.  Everyday it crosses my mind, at least once.  I am honestly scared this craving will never leave me.



Trying crack to understand my friend's problem was a huge mistake because not only have I caused problems within myself but now I can honestly say I understand my friend's problem and that makes me so scared for my friend because I know he is weak in the face of temptation.
