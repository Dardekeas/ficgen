I was a heavy opiate user for about 6 years, taking regular doses as high as 500mg of morphine per day.  I went into withdrawals on a regular basis.  I'd feel little sick 8 hours after the last dose.  By the 24 hour mark, I was feeling pretty bad.  By the second day, I was a total mess. 



`The most terrible flu ever' doesn't quite capture it.  Buckets of cold sweat.  My guts churned and squeezed painfully.  The diarrhea was terrible and constant.  All senses were amplified: sound was oppressive, light hurt.  I laid in bed with my fingers splayed because I couldn't stand the feeling of them touching together.  There was a near-complete loss of energy.  I was incapable of doing the simplest thing. 



Years after my final kick, and now I'm sipping Kratom tea.  My regular dose is about a heaping half-cup full, about 20 grams worth, steeped in boiling water for 45 minutes.  One in the morning, and sometimes a second in the evening. 



After a year of this dosage, I decided to stop.  I was a little scared, remembering my opiate kicking experiences.  So I set aside a whole weekend to sweat it out.  Last dose came Friday morning. 



By Saturday morning, I felt a little under the weather.  Not sniffles or anything, just mild disquiet, almost malaise.  I was able to go downstairs and make coffee.  Then breakfast.  Then make phone calls. I watched some TV, went out for a walk, worked in the woodshop.  I couldn't tell if the malaise got worse during the day.  I went to bed worried that the next day it would really hit me. 



Sunday comes, and things are pretty much the same.  I feel a little slow, but not much different than yesterday.  I do a crossword.  I do laundry.  I sweep out the garage, taking little breaks now and again to sit down. 



By Monday, I was back at work.  The malaise was nearly gone.  No sniffles, no diarrhea, no outward signs that I'd just stopped taking heavy doses of a drug that some governments put in the same class as heroin. 



By Tuesday, there are no symptoms at all.  A week passes.  A month. Nothing lingers. 



I've now done this 2-3 times, with similar experience each time.



In my experience, Kratom withdrawal really doesn't compare to opiate withdrawal.  The effects were so subtle as to almost go unnoticed.  I have more troubles when I catch a slight cold.
