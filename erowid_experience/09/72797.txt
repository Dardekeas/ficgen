[Erowid Note: The dose information submitted with this report listed 6mg of Diazepam (Valium) and 5 mg of Temazepam (Restoril) but the author does not mention those drugs in the actual report.]



I'm a 10 stone transsexual.



Tonight I smoked my usual dose of heroin (I'm cutting down so only one bag) but fancied getting high of sleeping tablets for the evening. I got bored an went an got my other bag to smoke, whilst finding it I found an ex's pack of nytol, of which I ate 2, which is 50mg. After smoking another half bag of heroin I noticed I was getting the nod quite severely and eventually passed out.



I woke up after an hour or so quite fucked and definitely much more intoxicated than I should be. For another hour I was unable to keep my eyes open and pupils were absolutely pinpoint. I felt as if I had smoked at least 2 more bags. Very dry mouth, tachicardia etc. all my usual symptoms of about to go under off smack. I was very surprised.



I'd consider using it again in this way if there was ever a shortage and I needed one bag to last a few days but this has really just surprised me and British users need to be careful it changes the nature of the heroin and really seems to reduce my fuzzy/noddy zone I get when I know I've done too much.
