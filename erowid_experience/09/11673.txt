First of all, if you have a known sensitivity or bad reactions to SSRI's or many other anti-depressants or are a paranoid or anxious person I HEAVILY advise againt this stuff. As far as I'm concerned it's pharmokonetics are nothing like opiates. I first took 1 50mg capsule hoping to get a mellowed out opiate-like buzz. I waited 45 minutes and had nothing but a light-headded zip, kinda like caffiene. At this point I decided to up the dose dramatically and took 4 more 50mg capsules and emptied out the powder into a little piece of toilet paper. I swallowed it and in about an 30 minutes I was in a near panic/convulsive state. I had to take 4mg's of clonazepam (Klonopin) tabs to calm myself down but that still didn't stop my mind from falling into a deep paranoid depressed state. Luckily it only lasted about 6 hours and the ordeal was over. 



Here's the amazing paradox to this story, My wife (125 lbs) tried a 100mg dose of Tramadol and in exactly 1 hour she was in such a `great place' she said she felt so euphoric and liked it so much like an opiate with speed in it. I actually had to hide the caps so she couldn't get to them. Also I offered the same dose to another girl (130 lbs) 100mg and she had the same euphoric high my wife did.



I have a good friend who is heavy into pharmacueticals and he (270 lbs) took an excessive dose of 20 50mg capsules equalling 1,000mg of Tramadol and said he felt nothing except a little anxious, uncomfotable and agitated for a few hours and nothing else.



Maybe the pharmakonetics of Tramadol Hydrchloride favor women over men?
