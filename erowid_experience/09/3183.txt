There was a great rave happening about 90k's out'a town, in a valley (middle of nowhere) so me and some of my friends had decided that we would go. I had been working about 9 hours that day and was a little bit tired so I decided that I neede a little bit of help to stay awake. Wnt to the local pharmacy and bought some of this stuff called `Vig' wich has a combo of Guarana, Ginseng, and Ginko. The packet said to take about 2 a day but I thought `what the hell, I'm tired!' so I took about 7 an hour beore arriving at the site. 



Once there, in the tradition of things I had quite a bit of vodka and then there's a gap of about 30 minutes where I don't remeber too much. The next thing I knew, I was sitting down on one of the hills amongst the crowd to just listen to the goovy muzac\ldots I was very decently trashed on the vodka by then but suddenly things started spinning sound like the whole planet was in fast forward and that really freaked me out so I stood up as quickly as possible and the spinning stopped after a few minutes. It was then that I felt `awake' while being drunk\ldots not really sure how to describe it\ldots kind'a felf a little invincible and although my motor skills weren't all that good my mental condition was brilliant. I decided to dance for a short while\ldots 6 hours later I was still going at it without a single break. I was amazed so I went to my friend's tent to tell him of what I was experiencing. He was not there so I thought I'd have a lie down and went out like a rock. 



About 3 hours later I woke with the a very calm but very rich euphoric feeling. ALL the alcohol had left my blood, or at least it felt like it did and I felt absolutely at peace with everything for the rest of the day, like I could never be sad or upset. Never repeated the experience so I don't know what it really was.
