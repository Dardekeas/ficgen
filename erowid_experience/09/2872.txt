Between May and August of this summer I smoked Calea on average about twice a week.  The dosage was one joint, which I usually didn't finish.  The first thing I would notice was that it instantly relaxed me, which was the main reason I used it.  There is also a slight loss in your sense of touch.  As far as dreams are concerned, there was a definite increase in dream recall.  I would say I remebered at least one dream 80\% of the times I smoked Calea.  Without smoking, I usually remember dreams about once a week.  It did increase the frequency of lucid dreams, but I would say I had less than 10 lucid dreams during the summer.  On average I am lucid about once every couple of months without Calea. 



Auditory hallucinations also occur from using Calea.  For me they consisted of waking up hearing someone telling me to do something.  Once I heard a knock on my bedroom door in the middle of the night, when I knew no one else was in the house.  I've heard that the auditory hallucinations can be worse, but the knock on the door was the worst I heard.  For those who try it, my advice is smoke it, and don't expect results every time.
