As an occasional recreational user of substances that enhance my sense of well-being, I'd always rejoice at the ability to obtain any type of either hydrocodone or oxycodone.  I came across several websites that offered Tramadol (or Ultram) or even Ultracet (Ultram + Acetaminophen), without a prescription, and with overnight delivery.  



I started with straight tramadol since the Ultracet was much more expensive, and I figured that I could take a couple Tylenol with the Tramadol to basically replicate Ultracet.



I started with a dose of 150 mg. (three 50 mg. tablets).  After about 30 minutes, I felt the initial rush that I always have felt with `codone' family substances.  Later however, the buzz got more intense and satisfying, but I found that I did not experience the extreme itchiness and spaced out feeling that I always have with `codones.'  Just a steady and pleasurable, happy and satisfied feeling, with my concentration levels more intense and my enjoyment of great TV and music extremely enhanced.  



I like to call Tramadol `hydrocodone light', which really means that it basically gives me the same buzz, but much better without the negative side effects.
