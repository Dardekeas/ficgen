I don't know how many people have had good experiences with Calea Zacatechichi, but I have been experimenting with it for some time now, with very good results. Here is how my best time yet went. I simmered 1/2 oz. of the herb for several hours, never letting it boil. When I had enough water evaporated off , I drank the stuff. This was the nastiest stuff I have ever forced down my throat. I mean this stuf tasted like bitter soap. No kidding. But once the infusion was consumed, I already started to feel some effedcts. A definate `buzz' came on within minutes. I added to this a bowl of marijuana with some definate synergenic effects. I sat down in a meditative position, with my eyes closed. Pretty good closed eyed visuals followed, with no real tapering off for a couple of hours. Overall, awake it was a mild but fulfilling psychedelic experience. Then, I layed down and went to sleep. WOW! More than dreams, I had visions, vivid, landscapes opened before me with strange and wonderous things. Patterns abounded in the dreams. I Got the destinct feeling I was leaving my own dreamscape and entering others. All this seemed to be under the guide of an indian man. The spirit of calea is definately male (unlike salvia and marijuana who I have always felt had a strong female bent.) He led me to this strange new world and gave me keys to doors I had never opened. Flashes from the past (the future?) Colors swirled all around me and if anything too wierd happened, I simply chose to use the key that brought me back to the `real' world. It was like a trip while asleep. Overall a good experience, Calea is quickly becoming one of my favorite plant allies, even more than salvia.
