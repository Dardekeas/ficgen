As a note, I am on a daily dose of 50 mg of Sertraline.



My wife and I were on vacation in Cancun, Mexico; and before leaving I had done some homework and determined that Absinthe was legal and available in Mexico.  During one of our shopping excursions, we stopped at a liquor store, where I purchased a 180 ml bottle for \$435 Pesos (about \$40 US Dollars).  



That evening, I prepared a modified version of the traditional Absinthe drink.  I poured a 30 ml shot over some sugar, and added bottled water and ice.  The taste was something like a mixture of black licorice and NyQuil, not very pleasant to my palate.  I finished the drink in a few gulps, and lay back to watch ``Men In Black II'' on TV.  A light drunk, almost stoned, feeling crept over me.  It was late, and I dozed off watching the movie without any spectacular results from the drink.



The next day, we got up early to get a good spot on the beach.  I brought the remaining Absinthe with me, along with a cup to pour it into and a bottle of Sprite to wash it down with.  Over the course of 2 hours, I drank the Absinthe in 5 30 ml shots; taking one shot every 20 minutes.  



After the first two shots, I felt the same drunk/stoned feeling coming over me.  The third and fourth shots brought on an increased ``altered'' feeling which continued to build.  At this point, I got out my portable CD player, and put on Sasha \& Digweed's ``Northern Exposure, Vol. 1.''   I took my final shot, and lay back on my beach chair.  The waves rolling in took on a hypnotic quality, and I watched, entranced, as the music rushed and swelled in my ears.  This brand of Absinthe was 55\% alcohol, and five shots of any booze that strong would get me well on my way to drunk.  But this was different.  I definitely felt the alcohol, but along with that I felt like I had smoked a nice bowl of cannabis, and nibbled on a single mushroom cap.  The Absinthe, the sea, the music, and the blazing Cancun sun converged, and the peak of the experience hit.  The song ``I'm Free'' by Morgan King came on, and I had a revelation.  I was free, but only for the moment.  In a few days, I would be returning to my normal life, and going back to drudgery at the office. 



I recognize work as a necessary evil; it's what I have to do in order to provide food, clothes, and shelter for myself, my wife, and my boy.  But I hate sitting in a cube for 8 hours a day, doing meaningless work to earn those things.  Writing has always been a passion of mine, but it is something that I have let slip over the past few years.  I realized that if I ever want to be truly free, to escape from the 9 to 5 boredom, I need to pursue my writing, and try to make a living out of it.



My mind was inundated with creative ideas, and I spent the next hour or so coming up with new character developments and plot twists to add to stories that I have let sit stagnant.  Eventually I drifted off to sleep, creative concepts still swirling in my head.  I awoke a while later, and my wife and I continued with our day; the Absinthe having no negative after effects at all.  The comedown was smooth and easy, and I transitioned back to ``normal'' with no problems.



This experience gave me a renewed fervor for my writing, and I am grateful for the insight I gained thanks to this wonderful substance.
