Everything in quotes is exactly as I wrote it down during the trip after that is supplemental information. This is my first time with the 25c-NBOME compound. I have tried 25i-NBOME and 25b-NBOME before to great success.



10:00AM: `Placed blotter up in between gums turned on some music, blotter feels like it's chilling the gums'



This is zero time. I just woke up and removed one blotter from a strip and placed it in the upper right part of my gums. It fits snug up there and I think I notice the numbing effect that thus far all the nbome serious has shown. I wait about 15 minutes before getting in the shower to let the compound manifest. 



+0.20 I hop in the shower and the first thing I notice is a picture of water on the side of a shampoo bottle, it's flowing and morphing around the surface of the bottle and coming out of it slightly. I looked around and could see no other visuals. I poke the blotter with my tongue and it tastes awful. 



+1:00 `Effects noticeable, hard to type, trailing, noticing small details, clear head if easy to get distracted' 



Small things are starting to pop out I look at ceiling that I have seen a thousand times before, before it was just white, not now it is a shimmering painting full of detail and stark contrast. It is beautiful; it is just a white ceiling. 



I tried to meditate. That did not go well, my thoughts just flow and I can't keep a hold on them, can't calm the storm, it's just energy though, my thought patterns aren't changed. 



+1.05 `Pupils seem a little larger than normal'



+1.08 `Things are starting to get that animated around the edges look.'



+1.55 `pupils dilated. Just went on a walk, felt very introspective. Still seeing trailers, every thing looks very liquid, bright.'



I have been doing some experiments with powdered KMnO4. It's a very bright purple compound that when added to a solution makes a very nice color. I tried to weigh some of it out and mix it with HCl. However I was finding it quit hard to separate out the small amounts I needed. Motor control was definitely impaired on a fine level, and when I tried to write down my measurements and findings I could not make the letters as small as I wanted them to. They just flowed off the page.



+2.36 `pupils still dilated, slight jaw clenching, visuals still very apparent' 



+3.13 `coming down?'



+3.27 `pupils more dilated than +2.36'



+3.34 `things still look wavy if view right'



I am defiantly coming down at this point. I slowly trailed off from there and by about hour 5 or 6 I was back to baseline. Jaw is sore I was clenching it the whole time. I peaked at a plus 2. 



I would try this compound again, and if I do probably increase the dose to 1 mg.
