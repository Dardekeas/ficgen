Since I didn't have any weed to smoke. I read up on other things to get high off of and I came across Zoloft. I new my mom had it, so I read up on it and decided I wanted to try it. I took 250mg at 6:50 am. I felt fine until around 7:50 I got really tired so I took a nap. Than I woke up and ate some soup and went back to sleep. Knowing that I would probably throw up I put a bucket near the couch.



I woke up at 9:15 and felt very nauseous so I grabbed the bucket and threw up right away. Now around 9:30 I am very jittery and shaky but really happy to. My taste buds are really off. I was drinking water and the water didn't taste like water it tasted like juice. At about 9:50 I threw up again. I went and laid down and at about 12 my whole body felt so different. It felt as if all my muscles were really tight and I was shaking uncontrollably. At about 1 it started to wear off and I still feel nauseous.
