I've been taking Effexor extended release (Venlafaxine) for almost a year now for treatment of depression, currently 112.5mg/day.  Prior to being on effexor, I had tripped many times with LSD and with mushrooms (psilocybes).  Since starting on effexor, I have found that the effects of shrooms, and especially acid, are greatly diminished in comparison to similar doses when not on effexor.  Friends who I regularly tripped with were having a great time, saying this was the best acid that had come around in a while, and I was barely feeling anything.  The best way I can describe it is this: the trips started, but never got off the ground.  About an hour or so after eating a few hits, i started to get the typical body energy thing that usually escalated into full-on trip, but the trip never came.  I basically had a mild body trip for a few hours but there were no visuals (other than maybe some mild peripheral tracers) and worst of all, there was no head trip whatsoever.  So I felt like i was tripping physically for a few hours and couldn't sleep, but my state of mind was absolutely sober.  



This has been my experience each time I have tried acid or mushrooms since being on effexor.  Not necessarily a reason to go off of an anti-depressant, but certainly a very unfortunate side-effect.  I've seen some other similar accounts with effexor and other ssri's and psychedelics, but I just thought I'd add mine. 

-Be safe, Be wise.  Know yourself, Know your drugs.
