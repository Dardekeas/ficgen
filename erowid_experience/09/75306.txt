Background



Having had decent experiences in the past with kratom and several very nice experiences with Blue Lotus, I decided to combine high doses of both and see how well they worked together.



Although I have recently cleaned up my act, I used to be addicted to heroin, OxyContin, and cocaine -- an addiction that lasted two years and really messed up my life. I am still picking up the pieces and still have alcohol issues I need to sort out. I recently stopped taking 8 mg of Suboxone daily - I've been treated with it for a year for opiate addiction. Either way, I have plenty of experience with all sorts of drugs and I know a good buzz when I feel one.



So I ordered 4 grams of 15X Kratom extract, 4 grams of 10X Kratom extract, and 3 grams of 25X blue lotus extract. All came in powder form. For the kratom, I simply wrapped portions of the powder in tissue paper and swallowed them for quick release. It was somewhat disgusting. The lotus extract dissolved easily in the wine.



Experience Log



4:35 PM -- Swallowed 4 grams of 15X Standardized Kratom Extract.



4:44 PM -- I am going to begin preparing the lotus wine as I drink a beer.



5:02 PM -- I have just put 3 grams of blue lily (Nelumbo caerula) extract (25X) into a standard 750 ml bottle of Pinot Grigio. I figure I'll let it steep for a while as I heard this adds potency.



5:04 PM -- The lotus extract dissolved immediately, turning the light wine into what looks like rum. There does not seem to be much of an odor to the wine. I'll let it sit a while longer.



5:18 PM -- As I begin to drink the first glass of lotus wine, I notice that the extract has somehow removed a lot of the `tang' that is associated with Pinot Grigio. It tastes like two dollar bargain bin wine.



5:22 PM -- Finished my first glass of wine. Interesting. I am beginning to get itchy like at the beginning of a morphine high. There are also slight perceptual changes -- colors seem to be softened and I am generally relaxed. I can most likely contribute these effects to the Kratom.

      

5:53 PM -- Mellow contentment. Not euphoric (so far) like opiates can be, but certainly more euphoric than benzodiazepines.



6:07 PM -- Still feeling quite relaxed, but still no strong high. I am a bit disappointed. Maybe I shall take the other 4 grams of kratom.



6:15 PM -- I just swallowed another 4 grams of the 15X Kratom Extract. The last paper-wrapped bunch of powder opened in my mouth, giving me a taste off pure asshole mixed with green tea. I almost threw up all the kratom and lily. If I am not very high in a half hour I will be surprised.



6:26 PM -- I gotta say, I do feel great at this point. This is an excellent feeling compared to any other legal high I have experimented with. And I've tried them all, legal or illegal.



6:31 PM -- I am beginning to fell a stronger head buzz.



6:41 -- Very interesting effects. I feel empathetic as if I was on MDMA, except without the jitteriness and over-stimulating feeling I usually get taking Ecstasy. Very, very pleasant, and I imagine it will only get better as the Kratom kicks in.



7:20 PM -- I never expected to feel like this. The effects are truly similar to a bit of amphetamine mixed with a weak opiate like hydrocodone. However, this experience does not match up with some of the experience reports I have read. Maybe similar to around 10 mg Oxycodone. However, the lotus most definitely adds to the effect of the wine in a very pleasant way. I have tried lotus three times before, twice steeping wine in the dried flowers for 2 days, and one other time using the extract.



7:30 PM -- I certainly feel `good' -- I am very talkative and friendly. It is almost like being drunk with 20 mg of amphetamine as well.



8:38 PM -- I just finished smoking a joint of some dank bud. I am feeling great. Obviously I am stoned but the lotus and kratom serve as a sort of backdrop to the cannabis high. I feel relaxed, excited, and euphoric all at once. Kratom and lotus seem to work very well with cannabis, I would highly recommend the experience.



8:44 PM -- I feel incredible. So much bliss -- comparable to a little bit of ecstsasy\ldots incredible for something I ordered legally.



Next day, 8:45 AM



That was a great experience and one I hope to be repeating soon. I fell asleep around 10 PM and had one of the best sleeps I have had in months. The experience took a long time to reach its climax and left me with a pleasant afterglow in the morning.



I would say the kratom certainly has an opiate quality. I had the same warm-head high like with opiates, and with the euphoria from the kratom, it was a perfect high without any hangover.



The lotus kicked in quickly after I drank each successive glass of wine, and after 6 I definitely had an energetic empathetic-type feeling. 



Marijuana complimented everything else perfectly. Obviously 4 glasses of wine added to things as well. But I could not attribute the energy and happiness generated by the lotus and the kratom. Definitely my two favorite legal highs.
