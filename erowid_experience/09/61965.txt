This website talks about drugs and also states of mind, caused by either chemicals entering the brain and doing their thing or by natural things such as meditation. Well I am bipolar, which was called `manic-depressive disorder' which means I have manic episodes and depressive episodes. Mania, to me, can be described as the ultimate `natural high'. Less stronger than cocaine, much more stronger than caffeine. I will attempt to explaine my mental state, emotions, thoughts, actions, etc. etc. so you can dive into my gift and curse of bipolar.



+Mania+



Onset-

Probably the best part of mania. What I normally begin to feel is



Mood Lift

Excessive Self Esteem

Energy

Creative Thought

Spending Sprees

and even a decent degree of Euphoria.



I become talkative, cocky, erotic, I tend to smile alot, I can sleep for 3 hours and feel completely rested, basically I feel supreme.



Day 2

After a night time sleep at 3am, waking up at 6am and feeling like a morning bird, going outside to see the beautiful Arizona sunrise during spring brings even more moodlift. I become task oriented, thinking of nothing but achieving my goal, I even help my dad changing the tires which he had to take a break and I continued on uninterupted. Visual flow of artistic ideation is swirling in my head, I usually draw a scale with all my manic feelings on the right side, weighing down the right side of the scale. To me that represents my skewed emotional balance.



Day 3

I don't get any sleep, I go on shopping sprees, buying hats, shirts, pants, candy, games, flowers, markers\ldots  Buying something always makes me feel good during mania.



Day 4

Usually everything becomes less fun, I become irritable, inattentive, like if I have adhd. This is when mania takes its toll



Day 5

I'm coming down, this is when I usually start feeling tired and depressed. My depression can be more accuratetly desribed as apathetic. Basically I just start not giving a fuck. This is usually the end of the manic ride and I go into the depressed state.



-Depression-

Onset

After becoming exhausted I begin to feel sort of neutral to apathy. I basically have somnolence throughout the day. I feel



Fatigue

Apathy

Forgetfullness

Irritable

Gloomy

Everything seems darker..



Day 2

Apathy then transforms into guilt and worthlessness. Suicidal ideation begins to creep into my thoughts. In this point in stage I think `what would happen If I shoot myself' but I rarely attempt suicides on Day 2, if ever.



Day 3-Day 6

Depression always lasts longer in bipolar, I feel like shit, tired, basic feelings of depression



Day 7 and plus

I never know how long this state will last but it usually lasts for 2 weeks where I just have suicidal ideation and such.



-Neutral+



Onset

Depression slowly fades away into what I perceive as `normal'. I can never fully understand what `normal' is but I know just what it feels like, or what I would think it is.



I decided to share this because bipolar, to me, is both a gift and a curse that about 3\% of the american population is affected by. This place is meant for Mind and Body, drugs or not, but anyways I hope this gives you an understanding to the simple but complex mind of the human being.
