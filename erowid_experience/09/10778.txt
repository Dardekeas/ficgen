    My freind M and I were hanging out on weekend when I asked my mom if he could spend the night at my house.  At first she said no, like she usually does, but after some begging and pleading she said he could stay.  I had rented Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey a few nights before because I thought it looked pretty funny.  I decided that we were going to watch it that night against my freinds will.  



Around 10 p.m. my parents were asleep so we went down the cellar and opened up the box of liquor on the shelf.  The beauty of the situation was; my parents always go to bed early, the liquor was down the cellar and they were upstairs, they haven't touched the box in years (my mom bought all the stuff a few years ago when she and her sisters went to Jamacia and got hammered every night), and they'll never open it again because they only drink beer.  We took out a bottle of some Absolut vodka and poured it in some glasses of Rasberry Ginger Ale.  I never really measured how much I put in it, but it was probably somehwere between 2 to 4 shots worth.  My freind is a pansy and probably put 1/4 of a shot and complained about how awful it tasted.  At this time and I had drank a few times before, but never really got drunk, just slightly buzzed.  After I poured in the vodka I stirred the mix with my finger and downed it real fast.  



M and I went upstairs after we had finished and popped in Bill and Ted.  About 10 minutes after the movie started my whole body felt real warm.  It was one of the best things I have ever felt in my whole entire life.  I started to get real giggly and laughed at everything in the entire movie, while my freind looked at me wondering how I saw anyhting in Bill and Ted. I laughed at everything, even when they air guitared I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.  I had to take a piss so I tried to get up.  It took be about three tries to lift myself off the couch.  When I made my way to the bathroom I was stumbling everywhere.  I used every chair in the house as support and was making quite a riot.  When I came back M said he was sick of the movie so we stopped it and went to the basement. I slowly walked down the stairs so I didn't kill myself.  We sat around in the cellar for awhile and I felt pretty tired.  I went over to M, ready to ask him if he wanted to go to bed.  What I said instead was, `Do you wanna\ldots  like\ldots  uhh\ldots '  and I started laughing uncontrollably at how stupid I sounded.  I went over to turn off the light and hit about three different things on my way to and from the switch.  



I went to bed feeling better than I ever had in my entire life.  I woke up the next morning with no hangover or sickness at all.  We forgot to cover up our evidence, so we took the vodka bottle and filled it up with as much water as we had taken.  I shook it around and it looked fine, so I put it back in the box.  I also noticed that I had made a huge mess at the light switch area so I cleaned that up as well.  M told me that I was a complete mess last night, but I just laughed.  I said it was the best thing I had ever done.  I still drink ocasionally, but it is never as good as my first time being hammered.
