For most fictional purposes a hermaphrodite is an individual that's both male and female; specifically, one that has both male and female genitals. Biologists don't use the word that way, but we are talking about storytelling here, not biology. In real life, however, a human that has fully developed male and female gentials is extremely rare. Humans with sexually ambiguous gentials and/or impcompletely developed ones are called intersex, not Hermaphrodite. here's one linkhere's another

Note: people who are intersex usually identify as either a man or woman (not that non binary intersex people don't exist) and being intersex does not automatically make you a "man and a woman." Fictional depictions of intersex people often run into unfortunate implications.

The word Hermaphrodite comes from the Greek deity Hermaphroditus. This child of Hermes and Aphrodite was born a hermaphrodite according to Diodorus Siculus (1st century bce). According to Ovid he was a very handsome young man with whom the nymph Salmacis fell madly in love. He rejected her advances, but Salmacis clung to him and prayed fervently to never be parted from him. The gods granted her prayer by merging the two of them into a single being, half male and half female. be careful what you wish for.

Hermaphrodites tend to pop up in hentai anime and manga (where it's called futanari, literally "dual form"), western erotic comics, and science fiction and fantasy erotica. Sometimes entire alien species or fantasy races are hermaphroditic one gender races, thanks to bizarre alien sexes. Hermaphroditism is also a popular way to explain mr. seahorse situations.
