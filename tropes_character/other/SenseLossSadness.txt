This is when a character has one or more of their senses deadened, sometimes to the point of total insensibility. This can happen because of an accident, damage to an organ/nerve, becoming a cyborg/robot (in which case, expect this to contribute to cybernetics eat your soul), suffering from and i must scream, or becoming one of the undead.

Just as in real life, the character will feel horrified and distraught over losing such a fundamental (and undervalued in hindsight) faculty. They will probably lament that while they can "feel" something, it doesn't cause pain or pleasure or comfort. Feelings of alienation are sure to follow, and an identity crisis is rarely far behind.

Interestingly, this might be counterbalanced thanks to disability superpower granting super senses in another faculty, or even oracular ability a la blind seer. However, a non-human or superpowered character who had senses past the standard five and lost one (like telepathy, x-ray vision, or something stranger), the anguish will be no less acute. He, she or it will have to learn to make do with the puny five human senses.A sense freak will likely find this the only form of torture that isn't kinky. The deaf composer keeps on making music (or other art) despite this loss. See also sensory overload and brought down to normal. The opposite is first time feeling.
