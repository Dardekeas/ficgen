Generally in sci-fi/fantasy settings where there are other non-human sentient species, they will often refer pejoratively to humans as apes or monkeys. Sometimes, even a human is seen doing this. More likely to happen in settings where humans are depicted as being less intelligent or civilized than other sentient races.

The Big Bad tends to do this often if he's not human himself, or if he is not human anymore. When used by starfish aliens, it can sometimes raise fridge logic issues if there's no basis for them to know what apes or monkeys are, in the first place.

Despite this trope's use of the word "ape" as an insult, it should be noted that biologically, humans actually are a species of ape. The insult implies that the human in question is uncivilised and therefore cannot be distinguished from an ape. Compare "Neanderthal".

A subtrope of fantastic slur.
