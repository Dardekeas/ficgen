Stories that have humans interact with aliens who are actually alien run into the fact that we're as weird to them as they are to us. This can cause the most remarkable misunderstandings....

This is a heavily literary trope, because the basic concepts are easier to convey in writing. One variant has humans as cosmic abominations to primitive aliens. See also culture clash. Many times, they think humans are ugly. This can also be used for a nice, satisfying author tract with the aliens puzzling "But why do they (insert the author's worldview's opposite here)?" An author avatar alien can encounter humans and deliver the author tract through what for the alien (in-universe) is innocent questioning but for the author (out-of-universe) is Socratic irony.

If the aliens are the good guys, then it is humans are the real monsters. If the aliens are more socially and technologically advanced, it's humans are morons. If the aliens want to figure out humanity, then humanity is infectious. If the aliens completely freak out and go insane at the sight of humans, then it is humans are cthulhu. It can result in alien arts are appreciated.

See also xenofiction, which does not necessarily feature humans, but takes the viewpoint of truly alien aliens. May be used to highlight bizarre alien psychology or biology.
