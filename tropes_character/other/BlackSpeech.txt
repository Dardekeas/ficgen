The language of mordor, spoken only by the one whose name must never be uttered and his evil cult. An indecipherable language that is cruel to the ears, full of hard consonants, guttural sounds, and always spoken loudly and harshly. Every word sounds like a blasphemy against All That Is Good, and the people speaking it often are as evil as they sound. If there is magic in the setting, expect speaking this language to be necessary to use black magic. In some cases, it's so alien and gravelly that it seems that a normal human throat should be incapable of speaking it...and sometimes, they can't speak it, only those with the voice of the legion can. In many cases, merely speaking the words is sufficient to twist reality or make unspeakable horrors appear.This is The Black Speech, the default mode of communication for inhuman villains, and sound-coded for your convenience. Where the elves and humans will speak in a pleasing, song-like language, and dwarves may (read: always) have a charming Scottish burr or Welsh brogue , the evil minions using Black Speech can shatter glass and eardrums and sanity with a simple "pass the salt".

On a more meta level, this is a direct emotional appeal to the viewer, invoking the "otherness" felt when hearing a foreign language crossed with the scare chord to make the good guys seem like downright saints compared to the bad guys. The effect is sometimes doubled by having  natives speaking english.

Once upon a time, nazis speaking German were considered to be using Black Speech (likely, the actors were hamming it up to sound scarier). Nowadays, German is just another language alongside french.

Using real but obscure languages as models for a fictional Black Speech because they sound very peculiar to native speakers of your language can get you into trouble. This seems to happen to Native American languages quite a bit.

this doesn't refer to languages used by black people.
