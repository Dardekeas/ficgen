Oh, hey, the aliens wish to communicate with us. They're speaking into the communication apparatus now...

Much as starfish aliens are the polar opposite of human aliens, Starfish Language is the diametric of aliens speaking english. Whether the translator microbes are on the fritz or the aliens in question are communicating with minovsky particles, it's unintelligible to the humans, especially to the viewers (unless there are subtitles, often only present when the trope is played for comedic effect). If it's a video game, expect there to be a few branches on the tech tree devoted to understanding the language and eventually the aliens' culture and intent, whether it be peace, cable, cattle, the opposite sex, or just to put a cosmic smear where your insignificant little blue planet used to be.

May result in the unpronounceable.

Contrast with strange syntax speaker, where the words are understood but the language rules are not. For when the language's grammar is very similar to Indo-European languages, see indo-european alien language, or, if the language has basically a one-on-one correspondence with a real world language, re lex.

No matter how weird a language like Georgian may seem to an English speaker, or how weird Xhosa might seem to a speaker of Vietnamese, all natural human languages make sense to those that speak them, and are in principle learnable by other humans. Conlangs are fine in their own separate folder, as are animal means of communication. Any language will seem like this to a native speaker of an unrelated language family, and often even to those who speak a related language.
