as you know, mermaids, like all fictional creatures, can vary in their portrayal from work to work.

However, despite all the differences in mermaid portrayals, they seem to have one thing in common. For some reason, mermaids tend to be called sirens, and are given the ability to sing phenomenally well, to the point of leading unsuspecting people to their doom.

This trope is an old one; the siren as mermaid was well-established in the medieval bestiary. In Thomas Hoccleve's early fifteenth century text, La Male Regle, lines 233 ff. speak of mermaids singing men to their deaths, "as old books tell us." The issue is not helped by the fact that in many Romance languages, the two words are synonymous. In more traditional definitions of mythology, the Siren is often depicted as a winged bird-woman hybrid, but somehow along the line they got confused with each other.

Compare our mermaids are different.
