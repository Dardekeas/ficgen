The human brain is hardwired to recognize faces. Humans will even see faces where there are none, such as the man in the moon. So there is something very disturbing about a person without a face. Meet The Blank.

The Blank is a humanoid character with no face. Perhaps it is a disguise to unsettle opponents. Perhaps they were a victim of some entity that steals faces, a common form of transformation trauma. Or perhaps they're just that good at poker. How the character is able to see, breathe and talk without eyes, a nose or a mouth is not likely to be resolved.

Not to be confused with the faceless. Compare faceless eye and eyeless face. the nondescript might as well not have a face, given how tough theirs is to recall. See also malevolent masked men and its extra-blank subtrope white mask of doom.

Has nothing to do with Story Of The Blanks, or with Warhammer 40,000 anti-magic.

A subtrope of this is the noseless.
