Everyone knows a child is more durable than a newborn, and that an adult is tougher than a kid. However, for humans it stops there â€” we might get older and wiser, but from middle age onwards we begin to physically deteriorate. Some creatures... don't. They never grow decrepit. Arthritis never settles in. They keep growing stronger, faster and more resilient with each passing year, and in some cases they keep growing bigger as well. They're not simply more powerful due to having more experience: they are literally tougher than any younger specimen of the same breed.

vampires and dragons are two of the most common species to exhibit this, with ancient Dragons and elder Vampires possessing terrible power. This can cause a bit of fridge logic if the creature is stated not to be immortal: if dragons become more resilient as they age, then just how do they die of old age? the answer could be the square/cube law.

A subtrope of older is better. See also monster lords, who are often older members of their species, and contrast evil makes you monstrous (for the latter, they get eviler with age and thus get uglier and stronger). For the human equivalent, see the old master and badass grandpa. See also monster progenitor and mother of a thousand young.

not to be confused with what happens to certain cheeses, wines, and socks.
