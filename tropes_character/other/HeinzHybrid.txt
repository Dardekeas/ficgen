In science fiction and fantasy, there are lot of different species. Often they interbreed, however implausible this is (for multiple reasons). One result of this is half human hybrids, but in other cases things get a little more complicated. For some characters, not being too fussy about species runs in the family, with the end result being a sort of multi-species grab bag. (One common definition of "species" is a group in which interbreeding can produce fertile offspring â€” try not to think too hard about it.)

Sometimes the Science Fiction version of but not too foreign, ambiguously brown. A common trait of a mary sue, and/or a munchkin, but not in itself a damning marker, as it can frequently be played for comedy or barely mentioned. Or the writer may deploy hybrid overkill avoidance to avert the problem entirely. See ninja pirate zombie robot for when the rule of cool takes this to another level. For combinations of only two species, see half-human hybrid, non-human humanoid hybrid, or for second-generation hybrids and on, uneven hybrid.
