A subtrope of half-human hybrid and a prime exemplar of hybrid power, a dhampyr is a child born of a vampire and a human. Generally they have all of a vampire's powers and none of their weaknesses, or watered-down versions of both: half as strong but only uncomfortable in sunlight (a stake to the heart is still lethal though). They are also frequently portrayed as vampire hunters and hunters of their own kind. Just as some cultures once believed that murderers and suicides could rise as vampires, a child born approximately nine months after the death of the father might have been accused of this.

It is more common for the father to be the vampire in this mixed marriage, since it's universally far easier for a male vampire to impregnate a mortal woman than for a female vampire to carry a child to term, due to their dangerous unlifestyles and strict diet. That, and sometimes female vampires are infertile, depending on their degree of deadness. Sometimes avoided altogether by just having a vampire (male or female) bite and turn a pregnant woman (see Blade).

Dhampyrs are usually at high risk of being mary sues and/or very, very wangsty. When done "right," however, they're usually tormented with an uneasy childhood, either because kids are cruel and they're hybrids surrounded by bigots, or because their vampire half is rightly feared by mortals. Of course, that's assuming their vampire parent is around.See also i hate you, vampire dad and lineage comes from the father. Contrast undead child.
