Where fantastic racism meets urban segregation. The fantastic ghetto is a place where an undesirable racial minority is rounded up inside to keep them out of the majority's line of sight.

Ghettoes are very much a case of truth in television: the term "{bor}ghetto" (Italian for approx. "little town") originally referred to the district in city state era venice where the Jews were supposed to live. Ironically, it has been asserted that the original Jewish ghettos were privileges, designed to protect Jews from unfriendly Gentile citizens, provided by the local rulers, including walls and locked gates which were bitterly resented by the locals. Like all well-meaning attempts at segregation, the "special treatment" not only turned out to be not so special, but increased division and tension between communities.

As a form of racial segregation, whether deliberate or emergent, ghettos still exist to this day. Therefore the topic is usually approached with caution in fiction, usually from the fantastic racism angle. However, it can also be implied by the unfortunate implications of having different races live in different areas (say, all the elves living in a hidden woodland glade) with little or no mixing.

Not to be confused with sci-fi ghetto, or the related term "fantasy Ghetto", where the genre gets this treatment by the literary establishment.
