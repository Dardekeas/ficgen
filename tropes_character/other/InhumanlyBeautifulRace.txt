The Inhumanly Beautiful Race is a fictional non-human species that is always, nearly without fail, incredibly good looking. Not only are they good looking, but they tend to be described as better looking than the vast majority of humans could ever hope to be. When describing their beauty, authors tend to use terms like "inhuman", "otherworldly" and "ethereal". Depending on the author, such a species may inspire either simple chaste appreciation, or immediate and profound arousal. In extreme cases, their looks are so incredible as to act as almost a form of glamour, instantly become the center of attention (and desire) everywhere they go.

While this concept can be found in all forms of media, it usually this works best in a non-visual medium. With a novel, the reader can imagine their own ideal of beauty. In a live action work, it may become a case of a subjective judgement of informed attractiveness.

angels and elves almost invariably fall under this trope, and the fair folk are often included. physical gods can easily do so. In recent years, Vampires have also increasingly been portrayed as having inhuman hotness and allure, in contrast to older versions where they looked more like walking corpses. And it goes without saying for succubi. Not incubi, though, as they're usually depicted as a kind of rapist gargoyle-creature.

Compare the beautiful elite, which is this in terms of a social class rather than a race, though not necessarily to the point of seeming inhuman. mary sues frequently belong to one of these.

In order to make this not-subjective, examples should only be of cases where the race is described as being this in-universe, either in the narration or by other characters.
