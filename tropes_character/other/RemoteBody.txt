a character has one or more bodies that can be operated remotely. Likely with equal or greater performance than if said character was physically present. Distinct from fighting a shadow in that the character is not an eldritch abomination with only a small piece sticking out in our time and space, but a person (human, alien, whatever) that operates a separate device or number of devices. Although, this distinction can get a little messy if, for example, a brain in a jar was given remote control of one or more machine bodies.

Perhaps they are robots, cloned cyborgs, hard light, zombies, whatever. For story purposes what matters most is whether or not your mind makes it real and if the connection can be sabotaged.

Compare and Contrast: actually a doombot, astral projection, body surf, decoy getaway, demonic possession, enemy without, myself my avatar, people puppets, robot me, and soul jar.
