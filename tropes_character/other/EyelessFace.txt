Imagine you're drawing a face. You draw an oval, perhaps a jutting chin, some ruffled hair. Give him (or her, it doesn't matter) ears and a nose and a nice big smile. And then stop.

What does it look like? Well, not human, that's for sure. Without eyes (even just the sockets), our faces are unrecognizable and unreal. Without eyes, how can we see? More importantly, we as human beings normally use eye contact to connect with others on an emotional level (with a few exceptions). It is said that eyes are windows to the soul, so intuitively it is impossible to connect with something/someone that has no eyes.

Creatures without eyes can be downright creepy, let's face it. Seeing a faceless eye chasing you is scary, sure, but seeing an eyeless face is usually more scary, since it looks so close to human but there's something not quite human about it.

Compare with hidden eyes, which is a temporary, metaphorical implementation of this. Contrast extra eyes, where the character in question has too many eyes. Related to the blank. And if something doesn't have eyes on their face, they may have them somewhere else. Not to be confused with youngblood's disease. Justified if bizarre alien senses are used in place of vision.
