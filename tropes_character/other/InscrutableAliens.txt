Sometimes, it's considered a mark of good world building in the science fiction genre to develop an alien culture like you would any aspect of the story. To talk about their history, culture, motivations and character.

Other times, writers find it best to leave these questions for the ages.The aliens are simply there. Any attempts at communication are met with silence. Their origins, motives, and plans are all mysterious. Nothing is known about their society and culture. Their actions come across as bizarre, incomprehensible, and frequently terrifying.

This trope is common in invasion literature and horror, in order to add to the "other-ness" of the aliens.

Often the aliens in question are starfish aliens and may speak a starfish language. Given most are malignant invaders, many times they're planet looters.
