Welcome, welcome, welcome to Smith & Tinker's Garden of Clockwork Delights! Here you'll find all sorts of magnificent sights, from mechanical monstrosities to lilliputian machines of supreme beauty. All of them are powered by patented Babbage engines with Antikythera brains. Watch as they mimic life! See their powerful brains thinking with each turn of the gears! Don't try to feed them any logical quandaries, lest you make their gears clog and smoke pour out them.

...Hey! You little punks, stop coming around here! This ain't a picture show!

A virtual requirement for clock punk settings, and very often found in steam punk as well. wind-up key optional. Sufficiently humanoid ones also overlap with artificial human and/or ridiculously human robots.

See also mechanical monster. Has nothing to do with A Clockwork Orange.
