So you think you're hot stuff, eh? You actually did it, you punched out cthulhu. You drove the hit points of that physical god, demon, or eldritch abomination down to zero, and it vanished.

Unfortunately â€” he's coming back. You see, what you killed was just part of him. the physical part that was inhabiting our universe at the time. His reappearance isn't coming back from the dead. It's regrowing a fingernail. This is how powers that be can occasionally take things into their own hands without breaking Da Rules.

This isn't to say there wasn't some accomplishment here. At the very least, he's gone for now. In some cases this can mean peace for years. And in some...days. Better spend that time researching a way to make him deader than dead or at least find a way to seal him in a can so that he can't rise again to threaten the land.

These tend to  Its awareness is mostly in the form it's taking in this universe; the death of this body merely returns it to its origin point like a rubber band being let go. These type tend to be vulnerable to  A more mortal villain may also get in on this act through the use of ensorcelling Not related to (but sometimes achieved by) casting a shadow. Also see: as long as there is evil, soul jar. The inverse of this trope is synchronization where killing one part kills the rest. Compare actually a doombot, worf had the flu, backup twin, cloning gambit, and robot master, decoy getaway and faking the dead.
