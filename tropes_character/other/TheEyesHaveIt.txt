One of the scariest things you can see on film is something you know is not alive acting as if it is; statues move, eyes of dolls pop open, parts of the architecture animating of their own accord. This can happen as someone is watching it, or out of the corner of the eye, ceasing as soon as the character looks right at it. It doesn't matter, it is more than enough to send some unstable souls over the edge into madness (followed quite often by death).

Note that this trope is particularly effective and chilling when the audience never knows if what they're seeing is real, or all in the character's head. And while such occurrences usually result in the demise of the witness, it's not required that they literally keel over due to fear. Quite often, the imagery of the moving/living inanimate implies a guilty conscience, if not outright stated.

Subtrope of malevolent architecture. Almost always produces nightmare/paranoia fuel. (Although if done badly, this leads to narm.) Often related to your mind makes it real and clap your hands if you believe.

Despite the trope name, it doesn't always have to be eyes. And while a particularly visceral, textual description is possible, this trope almost always appears in visual media.

Compare uncanny valley. Related to demonic dummy, perverse puppet, portrait painting peephole and living toys. Sometimes overlaps with eye awaken, though that trope usually only applies to living (or at least sentient) creatures.

Not to be confused with the Charmed episode of the same name, which made use of eye scream rather than this trope. Or the Criminal Minds episode, also with the same name, which also makes use of eye scream.
