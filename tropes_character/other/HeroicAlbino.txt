The inverse of the evil albino, the Heroic Albino is a good guy who has albinism. Albinism is a condition that affects the production of melanin, causing the body and hair of the subject to be white. Use of this condition to indicate heroism usually takes advantage of the idea that that light is good. White is the color of innocence, purity and holiness, so a character whose whole body is white must be very good indeed.

This trope is popular in Japan, where pale skin is considered very fashionable. In the west, pale skin is usually frowned upon as looking sickly or creepy, making the inverse of the trope more common. Heroic Albinos sometimes, but rarely, have the red eyes found in some cases of albinism in humans.

Evil characters should be listed under evil albino.
