A creature reproduces by impregnating another species. This can be a very literal pregnancy, a rearrangement of your DNA, or it could be the implantation of a parasitic egg or larva into the body of a host of either gender.

May very well lead to a chest burster.

The real life scientific term for a creature (usually an insect species) that does this to other species is a parasitoid.

A subtrope of orifice invasion. See anal probing and boldly coming for more alien on human action. See also mars needs women. Despite the name given to the trope, the impregnation does not have to occur via the face of the victim.
