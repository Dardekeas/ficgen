In short, a situation where a character is attractive or sexualized for one of the following reasons:

 They don't fully comply to gender ideals.

 They are mysterious, weird, or dangerous.

 Society shuns them or treats them as undesirables, outcasts or criminals.

This trope describes the situation where one character bucks the social status, responsibility and/or gender roles that their community expects or encourages and is thus desired by a select individual or group because of it. One reason for the attraction is simply that they're a refreshing change of pace from the norm. Another is that challenging cultural norms demonstrates a degree of power, confidence, or intellect. Yet another is an instinct to nurture those societal rejects, and to thus feel needed. A fourth possibility is a belief they can be changed via the power of love.

Compare freaky is cool, and the anti-role model. Related to appeal to novelty.

Contrast the proper lady and world's most beautiful woman, along with the gentleman and a scholar and world's strongest man, who both personify their respective gender roles. See also proud warrior race guy, ridiculously average guy and the beautiful elite for more contrast.

Many examples may also be an escapist character.
