A Catgirl is a character that looks mostly like a human but she has some parts like a cat, usually the ears, tail, eyes, and sometimes claws or even a natural fur bikini. A Catgirl is not furry, and should still have human skin, human hair, a human face, a completely human nose, and a human skull and torso structure. The Catgirl is stereotypically female, though examples of Catboy can also be found.

A Catgirl can also have other minor feline features, such as a cat tail, cute little fangs, cat-like animal eyes, femme fatalons or actual claws. She often has personality traits that conform to feline animal stereotypes. She might also have a verbal tic that imitates the sound of a cat. She might also demonstrate a faux paw.

Some catgirls are biologically Catgirl, either because of some degree of non-human ancestry or because of a change brought upon by magic and powers or applied phlebotinum. Examples do not have to be defaultly Catgirls. They can be normal humans who have been turned into Catgirls. These catgirls would be a subcategory of unusual ears and little bit beastly.

Other Catgirls merely wear cat-themed costumes, sometimes as part of feline themed animal motifs. These Catgirls would be a subcategory of animal-eared headband. Faux kitties will wear at least fake ears, and often a fake tail. Sometimes they wear gloves resembling cat paws.

A catgirl's ears and tail don't have to be that of a housecat. They can be that of any cat species, big or small.
