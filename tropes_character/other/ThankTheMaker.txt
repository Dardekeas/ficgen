Intelligences created by or dependent on humans, especially robots, frequently view their creators or hosts as deities.

This often leads to variations on "Thank God" or "For heaven's sake" with "creator" substituted, as a science-fiction variation of oh my gods!.

Compare with physical god, where the creations' worship is because the creator(s) are gods, living toys, where the characters are usually inexplicably aware and tend to rely on their owners for meaning in their lives, and deity of human origin, where the act of creating ais is what make the humans divine. thank the maker adherents consider their creators benevolent or at least generally benign.

Not to be confused with the maker, although there's an obvious overlap.
