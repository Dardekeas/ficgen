The alien horde approaches. They don't necessarily enjoy giving us a face full of alien wing-wong, or be the virus and transform us, or what all... they're simply driven into adding biomass by whatever means necessary and as fast as possible.

Because the only purpose they have in life, the be-all and end-all of their existence, is their insatiable hunger, the conversion of all organic matter in the universe into more of them. They don't do diplomacy, because you don't bargain with lunch. This is, of course, always cause for a bug war.

Most Locust Hordes use, or are, organic technology. However, nanomachines can also become a Horde â€” the (in)famous "grey goo" scenario.

Compare to serve man and the slightly less extreme (as in, they are intelligent and only want inorganic resources) planet looters, and do not directly confuse them with insectoid aliens and hive mind, who may or may not be this trope. horde of alien locusts is a common way to set up a guilt-free extermination war or creature hunter organization, since it's a fight between a group that wants to eat everything and the groups that don't want to be eaten. Not necessarily related to giant space flea from nowhere. Related to the swarm and planetary parasite.

The trope is based, of course, on real-life locusts, which can totally destroy vast areas as they madly consume whatever they can before starving back to a sustainable population size. However, locusts are not actually an example, as the trope involves forces, species, or technology acting in an exaggerated parallel of real-life locust behavior.
