A creature, or entire race of creatures, can only be seen by individuals who possess a certain trait. For anyone who does not share that trait, the creature cannot be perceived at all. Usually, losing the trait will also cause you to lose the ability to perceive them, though in some cases, once you have encountered the creature, you will always be able to perceive them.

In the most common situation, only children can perceive the creature. Another typical example is when animals fall under the rule, but humans do not. Occasionally, although you won't be able to sense the creature, their presence will give you an inexplicable gut feeling.

This trope does not include cases where the ability to see the creatures is granted by magic or psychic powers, etc. Anyone in the appropriate demographic, no matter how normal otherwise, can perceive the creature just as easily. In some cases, the creatures can appear as people but the people possessing that trait can see them as what they really are.

This is the supertrope to invisible to normals and invisible to adults. Please place examples of those subtropes under the proper subtrope.
