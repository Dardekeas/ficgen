People of strange, exotic cultures are often depicted as being far more open to extended marriages, with three or more participants, than we are. Common in speculative fiction, this emphasizes just how different these people are from us, especially if they are humans like us or humanoid aliens that still considerably resemble us.

In most of the world today, marriage is limited to two people at a time, but that has not always been the case, there are a few places where it's not the case now, and some authors like to speculate that it may not be true in the future. Some works of historical fiction will use this trope to emphasize the exoticness of foreign or ancient cultures.

Historically, the most common form of extended marriage was one man with multiple wives. The technical term for this is "polygyny", and it has appeared in a wide variety of cultures. For this reason, adventure stories set in an exotic corner of the Earth are most likely to feature polygny. To some extent, this can be truth in television, although mere polygamy/polygyny is not, of course, an example of this trope.

In works set on other worlds, all sorts of extended marriages can be found, often associated with a free-love future. Extended marriage is often shown as an element of both utopias and dystopias. And when it comes to exotic aliens with bizarre alien biology, all bets are off. Monogamy may not even be physically possible, let alone desirable.

Subtrope of polyamory. The existence of this trope is often a necessity for a marry them all scenario. See the Useful Notes page, for the love of many, for a broader discussion of the general topic.
