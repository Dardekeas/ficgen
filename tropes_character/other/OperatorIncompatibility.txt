In speculative fiction, as in real life, technology is designed with certain unquestioned assumptions: The user has the normal number of appendages, is within a certain generous range of sizes, can withstand so many G's of acceleration. The user can shoot lightning from her hands, or commune telepathically with computers... just like everyone else in the builder's species. But not everyone is a member of the builder's species, and that's where this trope comes in.

In certain settings, finagle's law ensures these assumptions will cause disaster. Sure, sometimes it's a bonus, or even a built-in feature, that the alien saboteurs can't use the artifact of doom properly, but usually it's just a pain.

If a piece of technology only works for one specific user, that's loyal phlebotinum. This trope may involve phlebotinum-handling requirements.
