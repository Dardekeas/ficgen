When a work has an ordinary setting, your cast is going to be... well, ordinary. Your basic five-man band, maybe with a token minority, or a token girl.

But when you're the author of speculative fiction, authors can make the cast as interesting as they want. Enter the token nonhuman to spice things up. He (or she; this is a unisex trope) could be a rubber forehead alien, a robot buddy, a funny animal, a civilized animal, a partially civilized animal, or all of the above at once, but one thing is for sure. They aren't human.

Even demi humans like elves can count as examples of this trope.

A token nonhuman is not the team pet â€” the team pet is, well, a pet that belongs to the team, but the token nonhuman is a sapient being who stands on more-or-less equal footing with the humans.

Unlike other token what-have-yous, a token nonhuman is not there to attract a periphery demographic. probably. A token nonhuman instead serves the purpose of exploring the possibility of other species with radically different natures than our own, incorporating beings with cool superhuman abilities, showing that the main cast is not practicing fantastic racism, and exploring the question what measure is a nonhuman. If nothing else, the token non-human can serve as the amusing alien for comic relief.

Because most writers are human (to our knowledge), you'll likely not see more than one main character who isn't human, hence the "token" part of "token nonhuman". If there is more than one nonhuman character, you'll most likely see a cast full of nonhumans, with a token human.
