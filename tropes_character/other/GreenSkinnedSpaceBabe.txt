An exotic yet attractive female alien, tending to look exactly like an attractive female human except for odd coloring and a couple minor features added.A weird science staple, usually coming from a sensuous culture. See also boldly coming. May overlap with cute monster girl.

This trope is part of a larger double standard when it comes to science fiction: male aliens can be any shape or form, and very often are to show exactly how "alien" our extraterrestrial friends are, whereas female aliens (barring comedic exceptions) have to be humanoid enough to be attractive to male audiences. Thus you'll see alien women with plenty of non-mammal mammaries. To further accentuate the fanservice, they also tend to wear stripperiffic clothing, often justified by saying that in their native culture it's as ordinary as shirts and pants (or dresses) are for us.

Despite the name, blue seems to be a more prominent color nowadays (presumably due to little green men becoming a dead horse trope).

One big reason green and blue are favorite skin-colors for otherwise-human aliens, according to most creators, is because there's no real life human equivalent among human ethnic groups, thus eliminating any chance of unfortunate implications when aliens are depicted. (Skin color alone can't be seen as a subtle attack on any real minority.)

Warning: There may be some disagreements as to who will carry any children resulting from the union.
