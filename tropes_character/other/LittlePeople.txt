Just about every fantasy world has at least one race whose defining characteristic is that they're short. They typically fill the role of "comic relief" in an adventuring group (when they're not the protagonists), and often serve as the "cute" race in a five races setup. Not always, though; the little people can be made to fit pretty much any of the five races, with the exception normally being High Men (that spot's reserved for taller races, always). If any race of the little people is to be considered tall compared to the rest of those races, it's most likely gonna be a dwarf. Because they resemble a child, there's a good chance the little people are magic users.

dwarves, hobbits, leprechauns, gnomes, christmas elves, and some fairies are specific subtropes. If these people are really little and are the main characters, it is a mouse world; for other mouse-sized people, see lilliputians.

Not to be confused with little people are surreal, depraved dwarf, or the animated series of the same name. Should be distinguished from real life little people, lest you sound like Dr. Venture above.
