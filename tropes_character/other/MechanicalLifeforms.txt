Mechanical Lifeforms are a race of robots or robot-like creatures that are also considered a honest-to-goodness species of living things. They're just like your everyday living organisms, except they happen to have metal for skin, wires for nerves, and so on. They're often silicon-based as well.

These may be robotic animals, plants, micro-organisms, or sapient creatures. If they are sapient, they would never wish to become a real boy because, as far as they can see, they are as real as that boy.

The origin of such creatures is best left unexplained - they were never built by another race (well, that anyone knows of), and if they were, it would be treated as a very shocking revelation, due to the audience accepting their mechanical nature as-is. And should any creators arrive to cart them back, expect them to react just the same as humans would (i.e. much anger, denial, violence, and maybe a speech or two about free will).

Contrast organic technology, which are machines that happen to be organic in nature. Also see mechanical monster and mechanical evolution.
