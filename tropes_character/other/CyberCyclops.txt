It seems that if you want to give a (killer) robot, cyborg, or humongous mecha a really sinister look, you have to build it with just one eye.

Similar to the uncanny valley, by deliberately giving androids a characteristic that is not human, you're making the audience realize how creepily in-human they actually are. For more standard robots or humongous mecha, a single eye denotes a sinister asymmetry not found anywhere in nature (except the flounder). It doesn't help these eyes are lidless and usually glow a relentless red, creating the illusion of a singular and evil focus.

Can easily be justified (though rarely is) by the mention of a rangefinder of some kind, removing the need for stereoscopic optics.

Almost always a type of glowing mechanical eyes. Contrast faceless eye. Frequently prone to eye lights out. For the organic version, see cyclops.
