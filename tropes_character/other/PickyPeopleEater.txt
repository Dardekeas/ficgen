Humans, like most living things, are composed of many different organs and tissue types. Some people-eating monsters out there will not find all of those parts appetizing enough to eat.

A monster can be made more horrifying if instead of simply eating people, it eats only certain parts of people. The vampire is the best known example of this type of monster with its interest in blood. But for every organ or tissue type composing the human body, there will be some critter that finds it a delicacy.

The horror quotient can really be ramped up if the part the monster is interested in can be extracted without immediately killing the victim. The victim can then suffer a slow, screaming death in front of their companions and the audience as the monster painfully extracts its chosen food. Also a partially consumed corpse can be stumbled over announcing to the audience and the characters that something is rotting in Denmark.

i'm a humanitarian is the supertrope if the feeder is also a human (although, technically, this also works for other species that eat their own kind). If he's not then see to serve man. brain food is a subtrope. Those who are unfit for eating are usually too spicy for yog sothoth. Only distantly related to picky eater, which is rejecting normal foods out of immaturity.
