Alice accuses Bob of discriminating against/being prejudiced towards group X, and Bob denies it, by pointing out "Some of my best friends are X's". Usually played for hypocritical humor, as if having friends of a particular racial/ethnic group makes them not racist. Said friends are rarely ever present to speak for themselves and, therefore, can neither defend or criticize whatever it was that earned Bob the accusation of prejudice. Besides, being a member of group X yourself will not necessarily preclude your being prejudiced against group x.

Often a response to mistaken for racist. Related to you are a credit to your race, and often accompanied by not that there's anything wrong with that.

This trope originally appeared in All in the Family, where arch-racist Archie Bunker denies that he is, well, racist. When challenged, it turns out that all these "friends" are actually shoe-shines, waiters and other people who work for him, rather than anyone he actually socializes with. In other words, what makes it invalid was that it wasn't true. However, the trope quickly mutated; it was soon used to connote the fact that even having real friends of a race doesn't preclude one from being bigoted against them. Recently, even making the claim as a defense has been construed as ipso facto evidence of racism.

An undead horse trope that may be depressingly difficult to put down. See the analysis page for more information.

Can also involve boomerang bigots or bizarre character circumstances. Compare/contrast boomerang bigot.
