A lot of supernatural beings are described as having certain compulsive ways of behaving, which can be used against them. There are several varieties:



This is when there is either something magical that forces them to act compulsively, or some magical consequences for not doing so. Examples include a magically binding contract or geas that is in some way related to the nature of that creature.



This type, similar to the real life condition known as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, is when there are unpleasant emotional consequences to breaking the compulsion, such as extreme anxiety. heroic willpower may make it possible for them to overcome this.



This is when they act compulsively because they want to act that way. Maybe it's really fun to laugh maniacally or answer riddles or whatever, to the point where it's hard to restrain yourself from doing so.



This is when the character is apparently unaware of the consequences of following the compulsion. In these cases, it can be hard to distinguish from ordinary stupidity, but a highly patterned way of outsmarting a certain kind of creature suggests some sort of compulsiveness. If this is present in AI, then it goes under artificial stupidity.
