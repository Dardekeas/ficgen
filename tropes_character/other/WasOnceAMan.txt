monsters are pretty damn scary. Horrible, bug-eyed, slobbering, and in no way ever human. Therefore, it's all the more unsettling when it's revealed that a monstrous creature (almost never the main character) was once human, but became a monster through some sort of infection, curse, sheer personal evil or transformation. And there's no means of changing them back.

Related to body horror and face monster turn, but distinct in that while body horror deals with the fact of the monstrosity itself and usually follows it from beginning to end, Was Once a Man is where a creature is monstrous when first introduced, but is either implied heavily or later revealed to have once been human.

Sometimes the mind is not affected; only the body is. And sometimes the original mind can be reached. This does not undermine the horror of it. Indeed, in certain ways, it makes the horror even worse.

See also: body horror, viral transformation, the virus, tragic monster and stages of monster grief. Compare and contrast uncanny valley. Also contrast with ascend to a higher plane of existence, for a non-monstrous transformation.

This trope has nothing to do with gender bender. Also not to be confused with was once a man from nantucket.
