The single most important special effect of all time, bar none; the man in rubber suit technique was Hollywood's original go-to method (and still utilized extensively in toku) for portraying the extra-terrestrial invader, the experiment gone horribly wrong, and the supernatural terror before computer generated effects were a twinkle in a programmer's eye. This is not to say that the method is perfect — many a great riff has been made at the expense of the weaker displays of this technique — but even at its lowest the man-in-suit still takes notoriety in the form of narm charm.

Note: Not necessarily made from rubber.

Compare pantomime animal, rubber-forehead aliens. Not related to dressed all in rubber.
