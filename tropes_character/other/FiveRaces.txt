Many fantastic settings attempting a universe will end up using 'races' of people. This is less in the spirit of being different species (indeed, in many cases the groups can interbreed) and more an easy way to soapbox or describe different points of views and aspects of normal people; or, in a game world, simply to give the player a wider range of choices. At least one has a good chance of being from a one-gender race. These usually include:

 Stout ( Fairy ( Mundane ( High Men ( Cute (This doesn't include the various "evil races" that crop up, though some of those can fit into the above categories as well as their own.

If the heroes in this setting form a five-man band, there will typically be one of each race represented, since each race can usually "map" to one of the five slots better than any of the others.

     (Humorously enough, this often means that the Dwarf in the party fills the role of the big guy.) In the role of a sixth ranger, the 'sixth species' may be a lost or hidden race, namely there's always a last of his kind or some ancient ruins of the once great species. This set up usually enforces hybrid overkill avoidance to keep the balance.Not to be confused, of course, with the "five races" of our own world: European, African, Asian, Amerindian and mestizo (usually just called "hispanic").

See square race, round class for the deliberate subversion. The fantasy axis of evil is the evil counterpart.
