On this end, we have the hunter, the man who stalks the night, armed to the teeth, ready to mow down vampires, zombies, werewolves, or vampiric undead werewolves. And on this end, we have the friendly neighborhood vampires. The guys and girls who keep a nocturnal schedule, stop over at the blood bank for a quick snack, and do their best to help the community.

There are going to be some interesting philosophical questions when these two meet. (or not.)Van Helsing Hate Crimes are what happen when a medium that includes monsters and/or monster hunters calls attention to the fact that, in that 'verse at least, not all monsters are, well... monsters. Some of them are perfectly decent folks trying to fit in who happen to get lumped in with the one or two bad apples, like dracula. Of course, this will result in the monster hunters either learning an aesop or turning out to be those who fight monsters...oh, you know what I mean. If there are both good and bad monsters within this universe, expect the hunters to be far more competent at attacking the good ones.

Compare fantastic racism, which is like this only on a more wide-spread, societal scale. Also compare zombie advocate, who argues in favor of the monster's humanity, and inhumanable alien rights, when the hunter is a government agency of some kind. See also stages of monster grief, for monsters who may or may not like their condition. See also burn the witch!Not to be confused with what happens when Van Helsing turns lawful neutral.
