The original member of a line of monsters and said line's progenitor. Thus the oldest, and, often, the strongest of the line. Likely to be the top monster lord. In some settings it is possible that killing him would cause all of his line to be exterminated (or, if each of those monsters was once a man, return them to normal). It is common for the Monster Progenitor not to have the kryptonite factor or weaksauce weakness of his descendants.

Just how the Monster Progenitor came to be can vary. Maybe he has always been, or was created by god. Maybe he was once a man and was cursed or changed. Similarly, how he reproduces can vary. Maybe he does it the old fashioned way, or via the virus, for which he is patient zero.

dracula is very often made into the Monster Progenitor of vampires, as is cain.

Related to mother of a thousand young. Unlike her, however, the monster progenitor always is the same species as his descendants. He may be tougher, but he shares many of the same basic traits, while mother of a thousand young may have nothing in common with her descendants.

The biological equivalent of super prototype. Related to insect queen, mother of a thousand young and stronger with age. Also known as first of its kind, making it the exact opposite of last of his kind. If his death destroys his children, he may be the eponymous keystone in a keystone army.
