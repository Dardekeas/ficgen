A pure magic being is magic incarnate. Such beings have extraordinarily strong magical powers, sometimes approaching godlike levels. For Pure Magic Beings, magical energy is frequently indistinguishable from life energy, so that running out of magic power means death, or fading out of existence. Things that consume or drain magic can be very dangerous to Pure Magic Beings.

Although reminiscent of energy beings, Pure Magic Beings usually have physical forms, though those forms are sometimes rather mutable.
