A few works of science fiction and fantasy (and even some realistic fiction) take the point of view of normal animals, intellectual animals, intelligent gerbils, or starfish aliens. More than that, the creators of such stories take great pains to think through what it would actually be like to be a rabbit, a dolphin, or a giant betentacled being who smells colour.

A good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is in this genre or not: if you can replace the non-humans with (maybe superpowered) humans without too much trouble, it's probably not xenofiction: beast fables and works about funny animals are, in general, not examples. If it's taking place under the nose of humans, we may or may not have a masquerade, and humans will probably either be bastards or eldritch abominations. If humans are taking place under the nose of it, you may have humans are interesting. Contrast most writers are human. Xenofiction usually explores bizarre alien psychology. Do not confuse with xenafication, or the xeno series.
