A common distinguishing mark to show that a character is evil is to make the character an albino. Albinism is a condition that affects the production of melanin, causing the body and hair of the subject to be white. stark white skin and white hair are both commonly used as indicators of villainy in their own right, so albinism provides a convenient scientific excuse to make a villain look evil.

Because red eyes are a side-effect of some types of albinism, including rare types in humans, many evil albinos also have scary red eyes that provide a contrast to their otherwise white features.

In real life, albinism and similar conditions tend to carry with them a lot of physical drawbacks, including shortsightedness, photophobia and extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet rays. While an evil albino might be an evil cripple due to his or her condition, a villain's albinism is typically used purely for aesthetic purposes and rarely causes any problems.

Compare blond guys are evil and blondes are evil. See also white hair, black heart and undeathly pallor. For tropes about villains with other health conditions, see depraved dwarf and evil cripple.

Notable aversions and subversions of this trope should be listed under heroic albino.
