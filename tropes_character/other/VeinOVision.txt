Predators develop senses that help them hunt. Sharp sight, delicate hearing, a keen nose... and vein-o-vision. dracula and his ilk, as well as weirder fare, will have among their super senses the ability to see all the major and minor blood flows in a human body, often going to near x-ray vision levels by seeing their dinner's still beating heart!

This is something of a subconscious power, usually triggered by hunger. Vein-o-vision may be noticeable to onlookers if the character also manifests animal eyes or glowing eyes, but otherwise the power is inconspicuous. A vampire refugee or friendly neighborhood vampire will probably have to use heroic resolve to resist sucking on so many delicious veins in plain view. As such, this can cause a tomato in the mirror or similar effect on a character once they realize their best friend is now on the dinner menu.

Also in a pinch, makes the stalking vampires' POV sequence all the creepier, showing us just how much of a Happy Meal the hero is to them.

This trope isn't restricted to the supernatural. As the page quote and picture show, it's also possible to make a technological equivalent of this trope for spies and soldiers. Typically it acts as a cross between x-ray vision and infrared xray camera, allowing the agent using it to detect both the presence and weak points of enemies.

Compare meat-o-vision. Contrast volcanic veins and tainted veins. See also the dead have eyes.
