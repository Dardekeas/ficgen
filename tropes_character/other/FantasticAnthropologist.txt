Astonishing as it may seem, not all non-muggle characters are on a crusade to murder us muggles. In fact, their motivations will turn out to be surprisingly mundane- they want to see how us crazy muggles operate. I mean, how do we keep from getting cold without any fur? Where does our food come from if we don't have access to functional magic? And how do we... you know...

This usually non-malicious character type has one primary function in a storyâ€”comedy. Because it's hard to beat the humor of someone who doesn't understand human customs trying to make any sort of sense out of them. The fantastic anthropologist very rarely has long-term story implications due to their job in large part because part of their job is to keep the muggles in the dark about what's going on.

In terms of narrative, the fantastic anthropologist's culture can sometimes be a satire of our own. After all, as wacky as this guy may seem, when it gets right down to it we're not so different.

Depending on the point of view of the story can often come off as captain oblivious. Frequently an amusing alien character. Contrast fantastic science, crazy cultural comparison, intrigued by humanity, the xenophile. A subtrope of the watcher.
