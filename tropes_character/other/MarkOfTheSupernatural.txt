A unique physical trait a character possesses marks them as being magical or supernatural in some way like being an alien or a shapeshifter. This could range from having mismatched eyes, to unusual hair or eye colours, to any other odd features. These traits can be part of a glamour failure if they give away a character's true form.

Related to distinguishing mark.

If the trait is supposed to denote evilness, it's a red right hand.

Supertrope to mystical white hair and supernatural gold eyes. Compare power tattoo for another meaning of "mark".
