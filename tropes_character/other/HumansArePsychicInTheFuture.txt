In many science fiction stories, human beings, although only a minority thereof, are shown as having  psychic powers in the future. There is frequently no explanation of where these abilities could have come from between the audience's time and the setting of the show, nor, if these abilities were supposed to always have been present, why they only became accepted common knowledge (as opposed to dismissed as pseudo-science) in the future. This usually goes hand-in-hand with one or another kind of official recognition or registration efforts.

This is sometimes justified in story through resort to the idea of evolutionary levels. Compare telepathic spacemen, which is primarily concerned with aliens with psychic powers; the two tropes, of course, can and do appear in the same stories.

This trope may have first arisen from science fiction writers keen on initial research into claims of psychic powers in the 1960s and 1970s. In modern day such claims are generally considered bogus, but in the past, it seemed yet another body of knowledge just about to unfold, fooling more than one respected scientist along the way.
