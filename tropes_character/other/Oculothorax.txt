A subtrope of cephalothorax, a character's body is primarily an eyeball. Common variants include a character made of several smaller eyes around one giant center eye or a single eyeball above a wide mouth. A third common variation is a single disembodied eye with a pair of demonic wings. These creatures will generally move by simply floating in the air like a bubble if wingless. If they have limbs, they tend towards tentacles or wings rather than arms and legs. May attack using special eye-related attacks such as petrifying gaze or eye beams. Because of the symbolism between disembodied eyes and evil creatures like this are more often evil than not. It is also a good way to make them appear truly alien.

The name comes from the latin: "Oculus" meaning eye and "thorax" well, for the thorax.
