There are certain people who have been brought into the world that seem to defy it by their existence alone. They don't exist within the natural order and often weren't planned by any of the powers that be that keep cosmic order. This might be because they weren't meant to be here in the first place or aren't truly here. Their otherness is a characteristic trait, but not holding a right to this world doesn't necessarily make them harmful.

For the more dangerous variants that are of the grotesque and harmful kind, see eldritch abomination or eldritch location. Compare ret gone, which might be the state these characters enter. They're almost guaranteed to be immune to fate.
