It looks human, but it's utterly beyond human understanding. Every once in a while, dark things from beyond the fringes of mankind's consciousness will show up in forms that for all intents and purposes look like good old H. sapiens. In a few cases they actually were human until they went beyond the pale, but most likely, what you're seeing is actually a disguise or misperception for something you're really better off not seeing, or even the progeny or creation of something even worse.

Though its appearance is sometimes passable as human, it is still clearly... not quite. Even those that are very clever in human terms will have difficulty not setting off instinctive alarms in the human subconscious. Less subtle abominations will do their job too well and seem impossibly beautiful, while the even less subtle will distort their human form with twisted limbs or malformed features or other such monstrosities.

Despite its appearance, they will very likely also not think in terms human reason can readily grasp, and will often lack anything resembling a recognizable or conventional moral code. At best, they will be comparable to the fair folk. Nor will they conform to the expected laws of nature - or magic, in such settings - so expect lovecraftian superpowers and other unspeakable traits.

Subtrope of eldritch abomination, and sister trope of animalistic abomination. Compare and contrast monstrous humanoid.

Not to be confused with humans are cthulhu.
