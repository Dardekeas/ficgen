Some characters have a range of eye colors and combinations, linked to their emotional or mental state. Their eye color changes with their mood or their particular personality, giving a visual cue of what's going on in their head at the time. People rarely stop and think about how a fully functional "Mood Ring Eyes" would negatively impact the possessor's lives. She would never be able to lie about her feelings or secrets. Any crush, any secret resentment, any boredom during somebody's story, would instantly and undeniable be aired.

Sometimes referred to as Mood Ring Eyes, this trope refers to when the character's eyes change on their own. Minor sight gags (har, har...) such as blank white eyes don't count and neither do contacts.

Subtrope to eye colour change. Not to be confused with technicolor eyes.
