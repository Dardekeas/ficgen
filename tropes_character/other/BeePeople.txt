A race with an allegedly eusocial structure; roughly, one queen and lots of workers. Since this inevitably brings to mind ants and bees, it's often a one-gender race with some military/warrior overtones. Almost always occurs if the race is even vaguely insectoid, even though this isn't a common set-up for most insects. It's just very easy to associate a hive with a civilization structure, as bees and ants are often seen as extremely advanced insects who act a little like us.

Which group is designated as "drones" depends on the writer's knowledge of what those actually are, but they rarely get a break. Occasionally there's a small subversion that shows that drones do perform vital functions besides breeding, that most people just don't notice.

the queen herself looks different from everyone else, although she'll act like a human queen and is implied to be the strongest, instead of just being an egg factory.A "hive mind" or telepathic link among members of the race, whether by supernatural or more scientific means, such as radio antennae, is an almost universal feature. Naturally, it will actually be completely centralized within the hive queen.
