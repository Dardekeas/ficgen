Misery loves company.

A gang of misfits whom no one likes and/or don't like themselves either get together or, more often, an elder, often a zen survivor, brings them together: he (or, more rarely, she) just hides it better. A circle of true companions forms out of everyone's lives sucking so much they ended up stuck with each other. If they actually want to stick together because otherwise they would be alone, they are lonely together.

Very common in superhero teams who, while, fighting evil, tend not to have flashy headquarters or a get a lot of public support or respect. Also could be used for villains, when they're not qualified to be a quirky miniboss squad. The villain version is usually led by a straw nihilist.

A concise way of saying it: most, if not all of the cast, in the group count as the woobie (or at least have a lot of wangst) in their own individual way, even if it may not seem so at first.

Named after the classic teen film The Breakfast Club.
