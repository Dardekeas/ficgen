Our heroes are a force of nature. United, there is nothing in this world that can stand against them. Divided is another story.

Whether due to a plot device, a scheme by the villain, or internal strife, the heroes separate. They may be scattered all over the world, they may just go their separate ways, but the point is they are no longer a team. It may take multiple story arcs to get them back together. They may never get back together and even if they do their separate adventures and tribulations will have caused them to change and drift apart in ways they could not have foreseen.

When this happens, expect it to be the belly of the whale, even the darkest hour. No group would ever do this willingly because you never split the party. Expect the episode where this happens to be a wham episode.

Note: For it to count as this trope, it should be a whole arc, not just one or two episodes. If just one character leaves, or it lasts for a very short time, it falls under other tropes.

Compare let's split up, gang, where they split up, but intend to find each other again later, party scattering, where they are split up involuntarily and sent on solo sequences by an external force, and the fellowship has ended, where the split-up becomes permanent.
