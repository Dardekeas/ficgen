Works titled after the organization or team that they revolve around. A blanket way of naming character titles.

If it names the characters explicitly (or implicitly by numbering), it's a multi-character title. If their team name is their number, it's the notable numeral. If the team is a group of parents/children/siblings/cousins or otherwise relations, it's a family title.
