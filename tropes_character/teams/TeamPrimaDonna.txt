Someone on a team, like a military or superhero, who is self centered and wants everything her (and sometimes his) way. Acts haughty and superior to everyone on the team, especially to the na√Øve newcomer. This character can even be offended if the newcomer is in any way better or given special treatment.

Is often the lancer, and likely grew up a spoiled brat or royal brat.

But the character does have skills invaluable to the team, even if this character pulls the occasional leeroy jenkins in battle.

Also, if this character and the naive newcomer are of the opposite sex (or same sex depending on the genre), they are as likely as not to become love interests, or at least a potential love interest.

Watch out for break the haughty in some cases.

Compare glory hound, insufferable genius, attention whore. Contrast rookie red ranger.
