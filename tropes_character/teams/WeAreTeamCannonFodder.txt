When a main hero or team leader is so important to the story that the secondary characters' actions will have minimal impact when it comes to the big fight. This can happen in the natural evolution of the story, and is more tolerated when the terrible trio does it. When it happens to the characters we've known for a long time, it's depressing. The one bonus is this usually gives the main hero the best motivation to try his best.

Ironically, this is less jarring when the other characters have no special abilities, since it's logical the hero could be the only one to do things. In these cases, the secondaries will still find ways to help.

Goes hand-in-hand with only i can kill him. This is the result when they can't catch up when it applies to everyone. At best they end up overshadowed by awesome. See gondor calls for aid for an inversion. Compare/contrast hero secret service, where the team is useful but still cannon fodder. When it's done with extras rather than characters, they often become a redshirt army. Finally, compare spotlight-stealing squad.

For cannon fodder as part of military and warfare tropes, see... well, its own article.
