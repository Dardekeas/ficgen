Some groups or teams act as a character magnet. The group keeps on attracting new members and/or close allies. In shonen anime, especially, a former villain of the worthy opponent class tends to become a new teammate.

This is often used near the beginning of a series to build the cast. When done well, this makes a character's entrance more interesting. When done poorly, it is an anvilicious way of adding a new character. If it's done often, it will ensure that your series will have loads and loads of characters.

Sometimes, this happens to replace other characters in series with high turnover. Usually there's a magnetic hero at the center of the team, though other characters around him will also exert "pull" to attract newcomers.

This is the logical extension of the debut queue. Compare hitchhiker heroes, where the team is attracted to the new members. See also you all share my story for a similar phenomenon.
