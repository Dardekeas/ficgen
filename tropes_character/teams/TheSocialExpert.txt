The Social Expert is a character with people skills, especially when dealing with large groups of people. He can recognize the social patterns in a group, figure out people's motivations, and know who the person in charge is. The Social Expert can identify who's manipulatable, who's a manipulator, and who's neither. The Social Expert can make himself likable even to his enemies, and is normally clever enough not to make very many of them.

Social expertise is an alignment-neutral skill, but it's practically a prerequisite for manipulative bastard, magnificent bastard and the chessmaster. Nearly every deadly decadent court will have at least one, probably more. May also be the charmer. On the team, they are the face. Protagonist Social Experts are guile heroes, supporting Social Experts end up as mister exposition, and villainous ones are normally large-scale manipulative bastards. Contrast with no social skills.
