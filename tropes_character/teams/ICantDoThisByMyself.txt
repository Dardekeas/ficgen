the hero has accepted (or even jumped at) the call, and is ready to embark upon his grand journey to defeat the big bad. Unfortunately, in his excitement, he's left his old friends in the dust. Even more unfortunately, he's just discovered that he has feet of clay or that his powers are fueled by the power of friendship.

Feeling greatly humiliated and apologetic, he must now convince his friends to rejoin him in the fight. A simple apology won't cut it after the way he brushed them off. They're not coming back until he says "I Can't Do This By Myself"; only then will they rejoin him, and even then they often feign reluctance to drive the point home.

This is also said when an otherwise independent person tries to recruit people. The independent people are embarrassed to admit that they're unable to answer the call by themselves. They don't have the added guilt of having abandoned their friends because, well, they don't have friends â€” they've taken too much care in avoiding friendships before this. The person they'll be asking help from will be an acquaintance, a coworker, or, for maximum emotional torque, the rival.
