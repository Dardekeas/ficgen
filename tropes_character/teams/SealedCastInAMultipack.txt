Many thousands of years ago, alice and bob were sealed away (possibly to fight for all eternity). Cue modern times and they have, of course, been released by some idiot, starting the conflict anew. However all those millennia ago, Alice and Bob weren't the only game in town. There's an entire cast's worth of characters for both sides ranging from dragons to mooks and lancers to redshirts. Well then idiot, would you mind freeing alice's forces while preventing Bob from bolstering his army? jolly good, off you go!Welcome to the opportunity of a lifetime, writers, this is when rather than having just one count of sealed good in a can and/or sealed evil in a can you have loads and loads of characters worth of cast members trapped and preserved by the same means, all waiting to be released when the plot calls for them. Perfect for fleshing out your cast while making big savings on introductions and origins! but wait, there's more! This exciting offer comes with hundreds of packages to choose from. Pick our mixed pack and have the villains and heroes scramble to track down their allies! Pick up our all evil pack and have the heroes fight a new monster of the week, or pick up our all hero pack and introduce a new member of the true companions per episode! Or try our new wild card pack; each "canned" character will pledge their allegiance to whoever released them!

Disclaimer: Offer may require plot coupons. We take no responsibility for any characters who end up unpopular or too popular. If you want a large number of elite mooks who are in the same place instead of individual characters, please see our sealed army in a can. Cast members may resent being treated like macguffins.
