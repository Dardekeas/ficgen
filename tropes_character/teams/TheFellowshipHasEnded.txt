A ragtag bunch of misfits is pulled together on emergency to accomplish some grand goal. they succeed. And then realize that they are not exactly held together by much anymore, and the team falls apart, with each member now free to pursue their personal endeavors.

If this happens during the time skip between two installments of a series, it can become rather uncomfortable for the fans, who must suddenly start seeing the protagonist's former siblings-in-arms, to whom they've become attached, as semi-strangers again. In real life, groups of people grow close to each other and part ways again all the time, but this is always a gradual, continuous process, while in fiction, it is often fast-forwarded to save narrative space, coming across as abrupt and forcing the fandom to adjust on the fly.

If the team falls apart because the single member who held them together is gone, it's we were your team instead. That said, to qualify for this trope, most of the team must survive the ending (see everybody's dead, dave for when most don't). If the sequel rolls along, this may be followed by putting the band back together (to which this is a counter-trope of sorts). Compare let's split up, gang and breaking the fellowship, which are temporary split-ups, either on purpose or because of external circumstances.
