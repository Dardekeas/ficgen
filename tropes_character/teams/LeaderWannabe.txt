Who doesn't want to be the leader? Your team/army/country listens to you and respects you, you're the one to come up with the team's attack plan, and when all of you get publicly recognized, you get most or all of the credit for saving the day because you're the "face" of the team. Because of these perks, many people desperately want to be the leader of their team.

Those aren't, however, the only reasons a character wants to be the leader. There are times when a character resents the actual leader of the group, either due to an ego issue or due to justified resentment of the leader's methods. the lancer is likely to be a Leader Wannabe, because of his position on the team. Other times the Lancer doesn't especially want to lead but the Leader assumes he does, causing the Leader to watch his back unnecessarily.

This trope often manifests as the character declaring himself the leader of whatever group he wants to lead, but no one acknowledges him, often because he either annoying, does nothing to contribute, or a combination of the two. They will often be a miles gloriosus.

A super trope to the starscream.
