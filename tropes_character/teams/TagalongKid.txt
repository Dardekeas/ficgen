Typically the youngest member of a group, the Tagalong Kid is usually the Hero's or the Chick's younger brother. He gets to save the day about once per season, but in the worst case scenarios he'll end up being the load or designated victim in every other episode.

If the kid is part of the team instead of just a tag-along, the kid might sub in for just about any role but with the proper tropes behind him or her.

    Contrast token adult. Compare improbable age, really 700 years old, kid-appeal character, kid sidekick, the team normal, the team wannabe. token mini-moe is sort of the inverse trope; a cute kid added to appeal to older viewers through moe in its purest form.

Not to be confused with a child who's just part of an ethnolinguistic group of people of the philippines.
