Come on, guys! Let me describe The Team Wannabe here! I can be a great troper!A character wants to be part of some group, whether a gang, club, or being a superhero's sidekick. He/She will follow them around constantly to the point of stalking. He/She will hang around wherever they hang around. He/She will keep begging and pleading until he gets in. Sometimes he/she even might, but usually he/she just stays the wannabe since status quo is god. In a few cases he/she might get spurred enough to start to resent the group that rejected him/her, becoming a villain (or hero, if the group turns out to be evil).

The tagalong kid is often this. An ascended fanboy is often a former wannabe.

A sister trope to leader wannabe.

Compare never be a hero, i just want to be special, hero with an f in good.

Contrast the drag-along.

Compare/Contrast jumped at the call.
