The sneaky guy is the one in the team who searches things out, looking for traps, enemies, and other hidden things. If they go first, they sneak and hide, not relying on speed and strength like the big guy. They are usually mobile, carrying little equipment. They rely on spotting danger first, stealth, reflexes and their wits to stay alive. They are often stealthy, but the focus can also be on choosing paths thought impossible, being inconspicious, or some other strategy.

In a fight, the sneaky guy will probably try to stay inconspicuous, looking for a weak spot to exploit or a way to confuse the enemy. Ranged weapons are common, as are daggers and short swords. Very likely to be a combat pragmatist.

Many games, like Dungeons & Dragons, has prepared roles for the sneaky guy, like thief or rogue.

Related tropes are stealth expert, technicolor ninjas, army scout of the western movies, or the scarily competent tracker. Sometimes clad in a spy catsuit. If a character manages to be both good at fieldcraft and fighting straight-up, it's usually a ranger or the point man variety.

The sneaky guy corresponds to the thief in fighter, mage, thief, just as the big guy corresponds to the fighter and the smart guy to the mage. Duos with a big guy are common. the sneaky guy can also easily serve as the Beauty in a beauty, brains and brawn trio, or the chick in a group â€” at least they get to do more than as the heart. In a five-man band, the lancer or the smart guy can double as the sneaky guy. If serving in the squad, a not uncommon variation is serving as the point man, where the sneaky guy often takes on elements of the big guy.
