Blood siblings of either gender working together as equal partners. Their business often involves ass-kicking, in which case they are likely to be bash brothers or smash sisters as well. The easiest way to tell that a sibling duo fits this trope is when they are most commonly referred as "the Surname brothers" or "the Surname sisters".

brother-sister team is a gender-specific subtrope. Related tropes are badass family (for when the whole clan is in on the ass-kicking), super family team (when the whole clan has superpowers), unrelated brothers (a Sibling Team in professional wrestling - who aren't actually related), and wonder twin powers (for twins with superpowers that only work in concert).
