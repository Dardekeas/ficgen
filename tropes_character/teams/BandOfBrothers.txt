A Band Of Brothers is a group of people, dedicated and loyal to each other beyond all other considerations, due to the dangerous (often combat-related) circumstances they have faced together. The spilling of their blood, mixed together with a desperate life-or-death struggle, make them a family as close as any mere blood tie can make them. Beyond mere comradeship, being a Band Of Brothers evokes an ideal of grim determination to face whatever comes together, and to see it through together. It is this shared struggle that they become a Band Of Brothers.

Members of the Band Of Brothers know that they can depend upon each other. Their relationship is often deeper than mere friendship. After one helps another in danger, gratitude is often dismissed with think nothing of it because "You would have done it for me." A similar concept is esprit de corps.

The individual members of the group might not even actually like each other all that much, and may spend a lot of their time deriding and insulting each other... but those activities are strictly kept within the borders of the brotherhood. An outsider, someone not a member of the Band Of Brothers, who insults a single member of the group will find himself opposed by all members of the group, including several who had but recently been tossing insults themselves.

A Band Of Brothers is often formed after a misfit mobilization moment. They are equally often a badass crew. See also the power of friendship, blood brothers, a friend in need, fire-forged friends. Sometimes explain why the mildly military organization manage to remain efficient despite its apparent lack of regard for discipline and normal military procedure.
