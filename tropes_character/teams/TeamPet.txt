The default mascot of the team and usually the most outlandish of the bunch. Can be a robot, magic animal, or in a more realistic setting, a little girl much younger than everyone else. Often a small annoying creature.

Most of the time, the Team Pet is comic relief. For obvious reasons their mere presence can ruin a dramatic scene most of the time. More seriously, their motivations for fighting may seem kinda vague, especially when they are optional party members. You wish more of them were.

If the Team Pet is an otherworldly being, it may end up as an amusing alien. It may also be a pet monstrosity. In some cases of this, the team pet is a unique, "tame," example of a type of creature which the heroes usually fight.

team pets do have their other uses, however. We hear lots of stories of dogs pulling people from burning buildings or otherwise saving their lives, for example. Also, the Team Pet can go get help if its master (or someone else on the team) gets in trouble. And a Team Pet can act as an adorable scene partner for a heartfelt surrogate soliloquy. It can be a sealed evil in a teddybear if it is a not-so-harmless villain once it's restraining bolt is loosened.

gratuitous animal sidekick is a special category of this, often used in an animated adaptation of a live-action show. See also intellectual animal, nearly normal animal, talking animal, and timmy in a well.

tagalong kid is the human equivalent to this, robot buddy the artificial version.
