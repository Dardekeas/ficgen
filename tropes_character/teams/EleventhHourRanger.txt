A subtrope of the sixth ranger. The Sixth Ranger is always someone who joins an ensemble later on and changes it into another type. However, sometimes, they decide to take their sweet time and don't join the group until much, much later. So much later that the term "late to the party" is a gross understatement.

An eleventh hour ranger is any person who joins an ensemble right before or during the endgame/grand finale, sometimes even right before the final boss fight.

Compare last episode new character, gondor calls for aid and eleventh hour superpower.
