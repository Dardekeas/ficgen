In almost any movie or novel with a ragtag bunch of misfits or an odd couple, there will come a time (usually during the darkest hour) when they transform from a dysfunctional group of losers into a well-oiled machine. Perhaps the hero or the leader makes a rousing speech that rallies the troops, or the big bad has sufficiently scared everyone to stop bickering and finally come together.
