A dream team is needed for the con, the caper, or to save the world. Each teammember is contacted in a short scene revealing their specialty. This sequence culminates with all the members being in the same room together.

For the animated TV series that uses this phrase a lot, see avengers assemble.

Compare with a-team montage, everyone meets everyone, intro dump, lock and load montage, misfit mobilization moment, the order, & putting the band back together.
