A team falls apart after the heart or their magnetic hero dies, leaves, or ascends to a higher plane of existence. Without his or her unifying influence, there isn't much holding them together anymore, so they drift apart to pursue their own endeavors.

we cannot go on without you is a video game-specific subtrope, where the protagonist's death ends the game even if companions are still alive. Presumably they drift apart immediately, without even stopping to use a phoenix down.

If the hero comes back from the dead, expect putting the band back together. Compare the fellowship has ended, when the team was held together by a unifying purpose rather than a particular member, and losing the team spirit.
