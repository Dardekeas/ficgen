In a lot of video games, as well as most other media forms, there are usually two types of characters: Those who handle the main objectives (i.e. the main protagonist), and those who support whoever is handling said main objectives (i.e. the main protagonist's various companions). Sometimes, it's in the form of the soldiers who fight on the battlefield, and the operators who guide their troops from the mission-control room. Other times, it's the mentor providing teachings to the hero, who would make good use of said teachings to complete the rest of the mission.

Regardless, you can't have too many people handling a single job. Have everyone handle the combat role, and they'll die too quickly and easily. Have everyone handle the support role, on the other hand, and they'll be unable to complete their main objectives. Split the whole team into two halves, one focusing on combat, and the other focusing on support, and you've created a well-balanced team that can handle anything.

This concept is very much truth in television. Everyone can only do so much in modern militaries (and likely long, long past that...at least older than print, since European knights had squires to take care of their equipment).
