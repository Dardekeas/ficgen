The one member of the team who is most often shown cooking. May or may not be the only member who can cook, but is usually the absolute best cook in the team. May be, but not necessarily, a chef by profession. May be viewed as more important than the hero or the team mom if separated from the team with either or both of those two, but this occurs only in more comical situations. hilarity ensues if this character is also a lethal chef.

May express friendship for his teammates in a non-romantic form of through his stomach.

Often overlaps with other character archetypes, with more humorous variations including the big guy and the trickster. Compare camp cook and supreme chef.
