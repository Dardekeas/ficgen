Your super team is really popular! So popular, in fact, that the powers that be have decided it deserves a spin-off. What to do?

Make a West Coast Team, of course! Take all the offbeat, second-string, and popular guest characters and have them start their own team, in a separate setting.

A West Coast Team is typically composed of characters with totally different worldviews from their East Coast counterparts, but with a similar team dynamic. They are so named because most American comic books take place in the Northeast, specifically new york or a no communities were harmed version thereof (metropolis, gotham city). Thus, the West Coast Team tends to relocate to the second-biggest US population area â€” california.
