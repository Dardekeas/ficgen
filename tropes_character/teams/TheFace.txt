In a team character dynamic, this person is the Face of the team and they are the one you want doing the talking. They are charming, socially savvy, and otherwise know how to get things done with words. At worst they will be the least dysfunctional team member. This is the super trope for the characters that could fit in that role.

They could be the heart of the group and thus its moral compass. They could be the mentor if they're more into guiding and teaching. They could be the tagalong kid if younger and perhaps less mature but possessing certain insight. They could be the chick because everyone knows women are wiser, and her girly clothing will contrast the men. Together with the big guy and the sneaky guy, they round off the combat, diplomacy, stealth trio. In a talker and doer duo, they constitute the former half.

In a action oriented series, their role could be mission control so they can do their social thing without being on the front lines. Their special abilities include talking your way out, talking the monster to death and break them by talking. If they have personality powers, they will also likely manifest as psychic powers: telepathy, the empath etc.

    Not to be confused with face. Also not the face of the band, though the roles can overlap. The name comes from the tradition of Dungeons & Dragons where a character in a player party would be the face of the group: they have stats and skill sets based on talking and resolving conflicts without fighting.
