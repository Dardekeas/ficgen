True Companions are just like a real family Â– they may not necessarily like each other, or actually have liked each other at first, but they know they can depend upon each other in a crisis. It is a relationship considered to be deeper than mere friendship but more innocent than romance.

This sort of group dynamic appeals to younger audiences who are unfamiliar with romance, and appeals to older audiences who live in a world of complex relationships and convenience masqueraded as false friendship, who are feeling nostalgic about the times when friendship meant a lifelong bond.

A writer may use this to avoid writing romantic relationships, though this usually doesn't stop fans from making up their own.

This trope was originally known as nakama, a Japanese word that means friends or companions.    Compare the power of friendship, a friend in need, close-knit community, and undying loyalty. Contrast enemy mine, a house divided, we are struggling together, headbutting heroes and occasionally teeth-clenched teamwork.

heterosexual life-partners and platonic life partners are this trope distilled down to a two-person group (same sex and opposite sex, respectively). Often, a group of characters become true companions after a misfit mobilization moment. If the characters happen to be particularly badass, you get a badass crew.
