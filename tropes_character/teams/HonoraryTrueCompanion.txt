This character is on good terms with most, if not all, of the true companions of the series. They will fight alongside them, shed blood and tears, and join in the celebrations. With their close-knit relationship with the main cast, you would expect that it would be a no-brainer for them to join them in a heartbeat. Alas, their alliance is always only temporary and once the goal is completed they're off on their merry way; perhaps on their own adventures, not mentioned here.Unlike the sixth ranger, when presented with an opportunity to join the squad on a permanent basis, the Honorary True Companion is always prevented from joining due to some force of nature. Either they are "needed elsewhere" and other times they just politely refuse. Just the same, the series will leave it with the offer to join still being on the table for team. Despite never officially becoming a member of the team, they will remain the groups closest ally, being the first to respond in the need of help. And the rest of the team always leave the offer on the table if they ever change their mind.

Compare to the sixth ranger, eleventh hour ranger, and guest star party member. Contrast with sixth ranger traitor. Sometimes may also be remember the new guy.
