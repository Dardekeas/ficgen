A Villain Opening Scene begins the story with the villain. As it's an establishing character moment, often the villain's first act will be a kick the dog or moral event horizon crossing moment that serves to show how evil or badass he is, and often sets up the situation that the hero then has to resolve.

Common in stories in which the villain and the plot are essentially synonymous.
