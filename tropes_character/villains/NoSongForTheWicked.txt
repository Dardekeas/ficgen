Many villains, especially from musicals or disney animation, have impressive songs in which they boast about how good it feels being evil, or that use to expose their evil plan.

But there are also villains that don't have a song. While the hero and his or her companions have their own musical numbers, the villain doesn't sing a single note. This choice can be made for various reasons: to show that the villain is a serious business individual, to highlight his or her scary nature, or maybe because the villain has a bad voice. It could also have happened that the villain was originally meant to have a song, but for various reason it ended up being cut.

Remember: this trope applies when there's the lack of a villain song in a work in which such a song would be expected.

Could overlap with evil has a bad sense of humor, but not always. evil is cool and evil is hammy have less chance to apply to a villain who follows this trope.

Contrast villain song.
