A villain/overlord so evil that they literally eat babies.This is often used as an indication that a character is well beyond the moral event horizon. Can be played for laughs, given the sheer over-the-topness that the accusation of "baby eating" usually invokes, but can also be played for drama (or for sheer squick).

This is a subtrope of i'm a humanitarian as well as of would hurt a child. Also compare exotic entree. If the villain specifically targets babies, rather than just being repugnant enough to eat one if the chance comes up, then he's a child eater as well.

If this trope is invoked to test a potential Baddie's moral fiber (or lack thereof) it's if you're so evil, eat this kitten.

There is a word in the English language - Brephophagist - specifically meaning "one who eats babies".
