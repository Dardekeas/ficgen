The villain is merely told to stop his evil scheme, and he does. Usually, this is a way to teach the audience a lesson about the importance of communication, and sometimes it stands as a testament to the hero's badassery, but just as often it's played for laughs due to the sheer unlikeliness of the idea.

It's the moment of truth. The villain, cackling, stands before his doomsday device. His finger hovers unsteadily over the big red button, and you know he's enough of an asshole to push it. All hope seems lost... but then, the hero kicks open the double doors and bursts into the room. He looks at the villain straight in the eye, points his index finger at him, and says:

"Stop it! Stop it! What you are doing is wrong!!"the villain concedes. He powers down the machine and turns himself in. Battle over. Everyone lives happily ever after. And the viewer is left thinking, "worst! anti-climax! ever!"

Compare talking the monster to death, where the hero has to spend some time speechifying first. Contrast unhand them, villain! where the villain obeys the hero's exact words in a way not intended.

Oh, man!
