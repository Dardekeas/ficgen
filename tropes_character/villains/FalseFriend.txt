This describes a person, who may be a manipulative bastard, a bitch in sheep's clothing, alpha bitch, etc. who gets close to you and pretends to be your ally, friend, lover, etc. Basically, they earn your trust, and when you least expect it, they betray you and reveal they've merely been playing you this whole time. Another variation on this is that the manipulative character may find himself becoming the mask, developing real feelings for the person he betrayed. Sometimes, the betrayer may turn out to be someone you've known pretty much your whole life.

If a character with a friendless background finally finds a person who appears to believe in him or her, and then that person turns out to be a False Friend, it's almost certain that the character will then have crossed the despair event horizon.

the mole is perhaps the best-known practitioner of this brand of betrayal.

Closely related to was it all a lie? and i just want to have friends. Can lead to an et tu, brute? situation. If the False Friend turns out to be the guy behind everything, he's a big bad friend. Contrast true companions. The polar opposite of both vitriolic best buds and with friends like these... if true friends are always mean to each other but still remain friends. If it's about a character revealing their hatred for another during a fall out, then it's hidden disdain reveal.

Not to be confused with the term in linguistics for words in two languages which look similar but do not mean the same thing. ("Embarazada? ButÂ… I trusted you!")
