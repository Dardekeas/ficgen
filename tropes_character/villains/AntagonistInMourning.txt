An antagonist discovers the hero they've opposed for quite a while has apparently met their end, death or otherwise. After all these years, they're gone. It's too good to be true.

cue a rather bizarre sense of a loss and perhaps suddenly feeling more sympathetic towards the hero than ever before. This may just be the result of the loss of the thing that was a driving motivation in the first place, but occasionally the villain might even seem to genuinely miss him and/or feel that a fallen foe deserves respect on general principle. Luckily, the hero may well turn up alive somewhere else, and the mourning will quickly be dismissed as things return to status quo. Also a common cause/symptom of foe yay.

Contrast and there was much rejoicing. Sister trope of victory is boring. When the fandom does this to a hated character's death, it's alas, poor scrappy. Compare and contrast reminiscing about your victims, which may go hand in hand with this.
