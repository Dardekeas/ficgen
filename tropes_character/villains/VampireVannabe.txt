Everybody vants to be a bat...vampires are cool. vampires are rich, and powerful. vampires are sex gods. Who wouldn't vant to be a vampire?

Vampires are surrounded by humans who, vhile they haven't been bitten, do their masters' bidding in the hope that they vill be. Sometimes they're under some sort of mind control, but often they're just villing vampire groupies. How likely their loyalty is to actually be rewarded depends on the vamp, however - they might be exploiting this trope as a not-so-secret test of character in order to keep the bloodline pure.

The vannabe's desire can be justified, if the vork's version of vampires are cursed with awesome, gaining great powers and few if any veaknesses. This can lead to moral dissonance if the vannabe is portrayed as a foolish coward regardless of this - perhaps because being a vampire is just inherently evil. Or possibly because the Vampire Vannabe leaves him-/herself vide open to a pretender diss, vhether from actual vamps or their enemies.

Can vork as a deconstruction of the exponential population growth that vould result from the more common "everyone bitten becomes a vampire" model - in this case, the familiars may be feedstock as vell, with conversion requiring some more complicated ritual the vampire can choose to initiate.

Polar opposite of i hate you, vampire dad, although that can be the end result if the gig isn't all it vas cracked up to be. These characters are often goths, at least in their minds, and always les collaborateurs, usually vorking for a body upgrade. Compare the renfield, transhuman treachery. Contrast super loser, vhen being a vampire is no guarantee of coolness, and emergency transformation, vhen the person might or might not vant to become a vampire or other monster but basically has no alternative.
