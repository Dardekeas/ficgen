The super trope to filler villain and starter villain, an Arc Villain serves as the big bad for one story arc, having an evil plan, the dragon, and mooks with which to threaten Our Heroes. After that, though, he's killed off, sent into a humiliation conga, or makes a heel-face turn, and Our Heroes go on to unrelated adventures and the next arc.

There's no man behind the man for the Arc Villain and no greater threat inspiring him, and he's certainly not something so minor as a monster of the week. At the same time, he isn't really the ultimate big bad of the series, either, since his defeat doesn't mark the end of the plot - or even the end of the hero's character arc. He is only the in-universe big bad for a limited time, after which someone new takes over the position.

Isn't the same as the situation where a character is intended as the ultimate big bad, but a post script season (or sequel) starts an entire new story. In fact, Arc Villains are often used as middle rungs on the sorting algorithm of evil.

Compare big bad wannabe. Contrast disc one final boss and interim villain.
