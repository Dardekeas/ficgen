the man behind the man turned out to be about the least conspicuous person possible. The hidden villain was underneath your nose the whole time. The dog was the mastermind! Guess sometimes it is the person you least expect.

you've seen him before. Maybe once, maybe a few times, maybe repeatedly throughout the story, but you never suspected a thing up until the reveal. sucker. the butler did it is the classic, cliché example (which never really was a cliché.)

Beware, however, in certain types of fiction, such as when you are supposed to guess the identity of the villain, this can come off as an enormously crappy twist ending. Or at least a really confusing one.

Keep in mind that this is a Reveal Trope, so beware of spoilers!
