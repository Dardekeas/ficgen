In a high school series, there's pretty much always an evil popular girl. We'll call her the alpha bitch and give her an entry of her own, otherwise she might tell all the cute boys that we have smelly man feet.

She always has a posse of well-dressed, mean girls with her (two to four girls at the minimum), who don't really say anything except to parrot her opinions and attitudesâ€”sort of the high school version of evil minions meets satellite character. If the posse members are slightly more developed, expect at least a devoted second-in-command (who may or may not be an insecure mess), a pretty but dimwitted follower (who occasionally overlaps with the second-in-command), and possibly a new girl, who will be briefly suckered in by the alpha bitch.

They are often gossipy hens as well. They are very unlikely to be a friend in need, even to each other. May also overlap with terrible trio.
