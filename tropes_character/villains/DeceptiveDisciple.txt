The Deceptive Disciple gives the impression he is faithfully and respectfully following the teacher of whatever Way is being taught, but in reality he has his own agenda and will end up betraying both the teacher and the Way. The "Way" can be anything â€” magic, religion, martial arts, business methods, governmental policy, or any combination of these things.

Compare bastard understudy, a pupil of mine until he turned to evil (the pupil actually was good before), and the paragon always rebels. Compare and contrast the rule of two. A merlin and nimue pairing is likely to have this character.
