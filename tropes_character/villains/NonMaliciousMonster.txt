A specific species of anti-villain: a creature that could be called monstrous, but can't actually be viewed as evil, since it lacks any actual malice.

This is not to say that they're not a threat; they're usually a literal monster, and if they're not dealt with, many people will die. It's just that, in theory, options besides killing the monster exist.

Note the difference between a reluctant monster and a Non-Malicious Monster is that the Non-Malicious Monster is always an antagonist; the reluctant monster can be a protagonist. In addition, the reluctant monster is usually sapient or can sense people's responses to its monstrosity (see, e.g., casper the friendly ghost). The Non-Malicious Monster is more along the lines of a completely instinctive beast with no sapience; in other words, it's just reacting to stimulus in incredibly dangerous ways without bearing malice towards anyone. Imagine a 100 foot tall rottweiler if you will. If they do have any sapience, it's a case of being obliviously evil. Typically true neutral.

Certain portrayals of eldritch abominations go out of their way to portray the Abominations as, well, dangerous only because we're in the way. remember the last time you cared about the bugs you step on when walking in your yard?Sometimes compared to a more normal villainous character, frequently a corrupt corporate executive, to make the distinction between "monster" and "evil" more explicit and obvious (although authors using this particular variation should be warned that said normal bad guy is especially prone to becoming a designated villain). Expect early victims to be assholes for the usual reasons: we don't feel as bad about a giant dick being killed, and it doesn't hurt any sympathy we may have with the monster.
