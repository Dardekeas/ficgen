A character that is thought to be one of the good guys turns out to have always been evil.

For example, the hero is searching for a very special treasure. Too bad he doesn't know his way around. He meets a very nice person who offers to help the hero find the treasure. But wait, wasn't the temple supposed to be toward the south? Then why are you walking north? And why won't his guide answer his questions? And oh drat, there's the big bad. That "guide" was his minion, and thus evil all along.

Compare big bad friend and bait the dog. Contrast good all along.

See hidden evil for subtropes. Not to be confused with face-heel turn, which is a legitimate good guy going evil. This is when the character was always bad and faking good, not a fall to the darkside.

no real life examples, please!.
