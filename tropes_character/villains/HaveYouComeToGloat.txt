When someone is captured, and then one of the captors goes to visit the captive. The captive says the name of this trope. But usually, if it's shown, then he hasn't come to gloat, and it's just exposition. Sometimes he gloats anyway, though. Not limited to captures, either - it can be spoken any time when there are two longtime rivals and one of them suffers a misfortune. Sometimes the rival makes an unethical offer. For example, he may offer to buy the other partner's half of their business (the price is good, but it'll still mean they're out of business), or offer to pay the other partner's debts in exchange for getting the Love Interest, etc.
