This is when a villain doesn't look like a villain, and is even more terrifying because of it. This does not apply to particularly handsome or charming villains - that goes under evil is sexy. Characters following this trope look completely ordinary. You could pass them on the street and never notice them, let alone suspect that murdered someone just the other day.

In fantasy and science fiction shows, this is often what makes mundanger villains so terrifying. While the normal beasties the protagonists hunt down and slay are obviously fantastic monsters that don't exist in our world, these monsters could be living right next door.

Please note: The identity of many of these villains may be part of a reveal, so please use spoilers wisely.

An enfant terrible is usually one of these. Contrast obviously evil and devil in plain sight. Related with but not to be confused for they look like us now, where previously inhuman beasties learn to pass for human. the nondescript is when their "normalness" is taken so far that people can't even remember what they're like.

This is truth in television. who knows? maybe one of the tropers could just be this.
