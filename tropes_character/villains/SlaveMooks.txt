mooks who have been enslaved, and sometimes considered meat puppets. If they aren't brainwashed they normally rebel, if only in small numbers (due to fear). Normally played to tug at those tug-proof heartstrings. Nine times out of 10, the brainwashed version won't rebel, and any supporting characters are depressed by their existence. These mooks are normally controlled by the big bad or are part of a hive mind, and rarely do things willingly. Slaves enthralled by more than mind control are less likely to rebel, even against a perniciously bad boss, and may even hannibal lecture other characters about their suitability for slavery. If they aren't used depressingly, expect them to be comic relief. They can be pushovers or bosses, but they share the fact that they have about as much free will as a zombie. If they rebel, it will be in small numbers normally. On rare occasions they will be a boss, but rarely the dragon and never the big bad.

Subtrope of forced into evil.
