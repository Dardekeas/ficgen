Our favorite heartwarming orphan has recently lost his beloved parents and is in danger of being sent to an orphanage of fear. But what's this? that uncle we've never heard of has agreed to be our legal guardian! The family fortune is saved! We just have to wait until we're 18 and... what's uncle doing with that axe?

This is the Illegal Guardian, who may be an evil uncle or wicked stepmother or no relative at all with an evil plan to get all the money from those darn cough, cough beloved children.

Not to be confused with a nanny whose only crime is being undocumented.

 In  Subverted by  In  Count Olaf throughout  Sheridan LeFanu's   The main character of  In  In  In   Mime from  Rooster Hannigan and Lily St. Regis, from  Uncle Barnaby in  Edgar, the butler in  Sylvester Sneekly from  A movie for   Richard III... maybe.
