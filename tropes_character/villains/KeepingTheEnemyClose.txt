Alice knows that if she ever turned her back on Bob, he might stab her in the back. Surely, Bob is too dangerous to keep around... but, on the other hand, so long as Alice keeps an eye on Bob, she'll always know what he's doing. So, what better way for Alice to keep an eye on Bob than to keep Bob around Alice?

Often times, Alice keeps Bob close by appointing him to a position of power, such as her personal adviser. Alternatively, Alice might associate herself with Bob's friends, or in rare occasions, might even try to form a relationship with bob himself. Anything that can work to keep Bob under check at all times.

This trope does not necessarily apply only to villains or traitors, but also to any character who could become a dangerous loose cannon if left unmonitored, such as a blood knight. It is safer to keep these characters around you, so you always are aware of their actions and motivations, than to risk letting them slip under the radar. In the case of the aforementioned Blood Knight, it is safer to keep the Blood Knight in your army than it is to discharge him and not know where he is or whom his next target might be.

This trope is risky to pull off, since it can backfire and Bob will have a much easier time stabbing Alice in the back than he would have if she stayed far away from him.

Compare living with the villain; contrast go karting with bowser. If you get too close, it may result in foe romance subtext or dating catwoman.
