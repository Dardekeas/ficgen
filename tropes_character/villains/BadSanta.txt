You can't spell "Santa" without "Satan"... wait, what?

Sometimes, the anthropomorphic personification of a beloved holiday just can't take the stress anymore. This may simply lead to shameful behavior, or it might end in a full-blown violent rampage. Alternately, there may be an impostor bringing shame to the red suit. Or maybe an ordinary mall santa is just a jerkass. Either way, we have a Bad santa claus on our hands.

For children brought up with the 'commercialized' form of Christmas, Santa Claus can be seen as something of a symbol of divine judgment as well as a jolly child-friendly icon, making the Bad Santa almost like a combination between the knight templar and the monster clown. It isn't uncommon for the Bad Santa to herald his appearance with a twisted form of the 'naughty or nice' list - usually with severe penalties for whoever is judged 'naughty'.

An extreme form of paranoia fuel. Named after the movie of the same name. Usually ends up fighting the real deal, badass santa!
