The Peek A Bogeyman is one level more harmless than the harmless villain. He's (almost always) a cartoon monster who is more of a jerk than "evil". He takes advantage of the frightening image for which other more industrious of his kind have labored, and uses his existence to frighten people.

"Boo!" And then he laughs when they run away. This is all he does. Sometimes it's his designated job. He probably wouldn't know what to do if someone wasn't frightened of him, which is often an aesop.

Characters should be careful about what genre they are in, because true horror movie ghosts often pretend to be this to lull their so-called "genre savvy" prey into a false sense of security. Alternately, all it takes is one good scare to trigger a fright deathtrap.

Often the foil of the reluctant monster. Compare to the noble demon, who is a more serious version of this. Shouldn't be confused with the real bogeyman. Not to be confused with the actually scary peek-a-boo corpse.
