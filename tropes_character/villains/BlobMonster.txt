Blob monsters. Amorphous, often implacable due to their unique (lack of) anatomy, these creatures range from mindless eating machines to tricksy shapeshifters. Usually nigh invulnerable, and sometimes capable of voluntary shapeshifting. Often based on jellyfish, amoebas and similar invertebrates (or, in sillier cases, gelatinous desserts), this creature can be found throughout horror, fantasy and speculative fiction environments. Often acidic, it is usually defeated by being frozen, or by heroes who take advantage of its chemical composition with a stream of techno babble.

If it has anything resembling a mouth, phlegmings are assured.

A recent sub-variant has become popular on the various internet art sites — that of the "Goo Girl" (deviantart or Danbooru) or "Slime Maiden" (pixiv) — which is effectively the Blob Monster given the cute monster girl treatment, with jamanen and melona being the poster girls of this variant.

In video games, these will sometimes be the goomba, although sometimes some palette-swapped varieties are harder. They're also generally are resistant to drowning, especially if it's the player-controlled character. Sometimes, they can split into smaller ones when killed.

Another feature they commonly have in video games is being highly resistant to one form of attack, yet vulnerable to another. Typically this takes the form of them being hard to hurt with conventional attacks (how do you stab something that has no heart?) but vulnerable to, say, fire or some other sort of special type of damage.

Makes a good monster of the week. See also mega-microbes. Compare muck monster and grey goo. Related to the rubber man and talking poo.
