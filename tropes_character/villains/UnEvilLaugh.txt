A villainous laugh so remarkably stupid-sounding that, instead of striking fear into the hearts of those who hear it, it causes bouts of uncontrollable sniggering. A not-so-harmless villain may do this on purpose to deflect suspicion. A minion with an f in evil is likely to do it by accident. The most pitiful form of the Un-evil Laugh is reading the stage directions out loud. In other cases, if there's no lampshade hanging, it may be hard to tell if the writers or actors meant for the laugh to be genuinely menacing and just missed the mark, but only examples that appear to be deliberate on the creators' part should be listed.

Contrast giggling villains, whose seemingly unimpressive laughs only make them creepier. Also contrast annoying laugh, which sometimes coincides. Compare laugh with me in which the villain demands that someone laugh as well.
