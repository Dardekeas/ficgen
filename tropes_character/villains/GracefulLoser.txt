The heroes have struggled long and hard, but they have finally foiled the evil plan and beaten everything else that the big bad can throw at them. They have clearly defeated him. The villain, rather than trying to escape, freaking out or try and take the heroes with him, graciously acknowledges their victory and yields, surrendering himself to their justice.

This is not a trick to catch the heroes off guard: the villain really chooses to lay down his sword. He might one day return to fight the heroes, but that is definitely another day. Might occur in the case of an affably evil or harmless villain, or a magnificent bastard. Most likely seen if there is limited (or even no) hatred between the villain and the heroes, and especially if there is a sort of camaraderie between them, or both were trying to do the right thing; in this case the villain was simply misguided. Needless to say, the worthy opponent is almost guaranteed to do this. it might even cause them to join your side.Can happen more often in series where there is a cardboard prison involved. A villain who happens to know when to fold 'em just may do this. Can also happen when he chooses to face death with dignity.

Compare touché.

Contrast sore loser, unsportsmanlike gloating, i surrender, suckers.

super trope to villain's dying grace and touché, which the villain is likely to say.
