Most often a fantasy trope, the Religion of Evil has no pretenses of being anything other than... well, evil. Quite often it'll be a card-carrying villain that refers to itself as evil; sometimes it won't say that word straight out, but its tenets and actions will be such that its followers are necessarily evil.

Whatever the religion of evil worships will generally be the bigger bad, with demon lords, archdevils, eldritch abominations, gods of evil and satan himself all being likely candidates.

Media portrayals of Satanism tend to fall directly into this trope; for this, see hollywood satanism.
