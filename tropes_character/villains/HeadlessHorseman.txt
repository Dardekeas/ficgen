A specific type of undead (sometimes a ghost, sometimes a physical revenant), the Headless Horseman is a headless rider who haunts woods and roadways, often the one where he lost his head, in search of victims. Sometimes a Headless Horseman just seeks to scare, other times he will try to take others' heads. Sometimes, the Horseman will carry a jack-o'-lantern in place of his lost head.

Tales of headless riders have existed in folklore for centuries, most notably the Irish legend of the Dullahan (see examples below), but the trope codifier is Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, although that is arguably an unbuilt trope, as it is strongly implied that the Headless Hessian that pursues Ichabod Crane is actually local blade Brom Bones playing a prank to scare the shit out of the schoolmaster.

A common modern variation replaces the horseman with a headless biker on a cool bike.

The probable sister trope to losing your head.
