The other stock Egyptian style villain alongside the mummy.

The appearance of this character is pretty recognisable, chances are, you will see a striped head dress, called a 'Nemes', and perhaps some sort of ancient looking robe with sceptre.

And if the work in question isn't set in ancient egypt, they may be found sealed inside some kind of tomb or pyramid and vow to curse any explorer who comes near.

In video games, this character has a 50% chance of being the Boss found in shifting sand land, with the mummy being the other.

See also aristocrats are evil and mummy, the latter is arguably a sub trope.

The trope maker, trope codifier, and ur example is probably the bible, with that nasty pharaoh as one of the villains of the Old Testament, making this older than feudalism.
