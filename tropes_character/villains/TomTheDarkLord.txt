Generally played for laughs, Tom the Dark Lord is when a character that's evil doesn't have a particularly evil-sounding name. In fact, this could effectively be used as nightmare fuel if you have the character human. Tom the Dark Lord sometimes goes hand in hand with embarrassing first name, but not always. Bonus points if it manages to be meaningful or ironic. Contrast with names to run away from really fast, which is about evil people with obviously evil names. See also fluffy the terrible, which is about vicious animals and beasts with cutesy names. Compare special person, normal name. Not to be confused with ron the death eater, although that can lead to this in fan works.
