Long, long ago, there existed a terrible evil. The people of the time managed to defeat the evil and seal it away never to return. There's just one problem: they may have sealed away the being itself, but they didn't manage to completely seal away its power.

To be clear, the evil in question has been sealed away, but in a way that allows it to still influence the mortal world, most often in destructive ways. In religious and mythological uses, the evil is usually not aware it has this ability. In fictional stories, especially in the horror and cosmic horror story genres, it is likely to be aware of its ability to affect the mortal world, and will probably use that influence to facilitate its release.

Is a Subtrope of sealed evil in a can. If the evil is sealed in a person-shaped can it will usually become this trope. If the evil is sealed within a physical object, that object is likely to become an artifact of doom. Compare might as well not be in prison at all, for when this applies to mundane criminals. See also evil is not a toy, made of evil and villainous legacy.
