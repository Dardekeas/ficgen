Fair-haired guys in media frequently end up evil. This is especially noticeable if he is compared to a nice, dark-haired hero (think harry potter vs. draco malfoy) or if he is on the opposite end of a love triangle. In many ways, this trope can be seen as the less extreme version of the evil albino.

If they're not evil, they're still jerks, although they may or may not be nice underneath, and they usually lose. Where a betty and veronica usually has a blond Betty and a dark- or red-haired Veronica, a male version of this setup will do the reverse. In the latter, the female love interest will often be blonde herself, creating a double standard implying that blond hair is only acceptable for women.

The shade of blond may also play a role in it. light blond guys are much more likely to be portrayed as evil than dirty blond guys.

In the 1980s, this trope was almost inescapable, particularly in teen movies. The jerk jock in these movies was more often than not blond - and the hero was virtually always dark-haired. But before that blonds were often heroes, so this may be a cyclic trope, albeit with a longer cycle time than that for female "bad hair colors." That said, it has certainly become a much more prevalent trope in the days since world war ii, which may be responsible for this, since the Nazis did love blonds. Note also the above-mentioned tendency for a long-haired blond villain to be a sissy villain, thus implying that blond hair on a man is by nature effeminate, and reinforcing the trope that the epitome of manliness is still tall, dark and handsome.

Often synonymous with light is not good; after all, blond guys are more often associated with an angelic appearance than black haired ones.

Compare evil redheads, white hair, black heart, and evil albino. Contrast hair of gold, heart of gold. The distaff counterpart is blondes are evil.
