Rather than just feeling fantastic racism towards a particular group, these people look down on everyone who isn't them. They'll likely be the empire or the horde (generally led by an evil overlord or a charismatic president evil), and might possibly be always chaotic evil, though it's also possible most of them are simply fed on propaganda rather than seriously believing this. In any case, they'll hold to an ideology based around the idea that they and they alone deserve to rule the world/universe, and everyone else needs to fall into line or be exterminated. In extreme cases, they may simply want to exterminate everyone else without bothering to dominate them.

See also scary dogmatic aliens, and there will likely be in- or out-of universe comparisons made to those wacky nazis. If said comparisons are explicitly in-universe, they'll likely be nazis by any other name who go round putting on the reich. May show up as a central teaching of the religion of evil or path of inspiration. Contrast superior species, where the work itself presents a race as inherently better. They're almost always bad guys (as you can't play them as heroes without getting into a motherlode of unfortunate implications, though individual members can be sympathetic, especially if my species doth protest too much is in force) and they'll often show up as villains in works that are preaching an aesop against racism.

Note: Does not apply to races or cultures who think they're superior but have no interest in conquering the outside world. The Master Race wants to master the rest of the world, not be apart from it. They may already be served by a slave race, servant race, or henchmen race, though some extreme examples are too xenophobic even for that. Compare and contrast the absolute xenophobe, who skips the "mastering" part and goes straight for extermination.
