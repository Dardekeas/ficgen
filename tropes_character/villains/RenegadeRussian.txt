How to have a red scare villain without insulting the Soviet Union or the Russian Federation.

The renegade russian, formerly Renegade Soviet before the great politics mess-up, is (or was) a member of the Soviet/Russian military, government, or secret police. They are involved in an evil scheme, as either the dragon or big bad. They may well have Communist beliefs.

However, there's one big caveat. Their actions are neither authorised nor condoned by the Kremlin. Indeed, the Kremlin may well be actively trying to stop them, at the time of the DÃ©tente in particular. If you're too bad for the Soviet Union, then you are really bad.

This sort of villain may also be used in post-Cold War stories (usually as an ex-KGB or Russian army official gone rogue, who may or may not be trying to bring back the Soviet Union).

Note that it is also possible to have renegade chinese and in today's context, renegade middle easterners.

Some works have also used Renegade IRA in a (mostly unsuccessful) attempt to have western terrorists without getting into the irish question.

Compare renegade splinter faction. See also the mafiya, another popular Russian villain group. rogue agent is an individual version of this trope.
