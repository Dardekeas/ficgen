One of the oldest required dress codes by the Forces of Darkness. A Black Cloak villain sometimes even refers to himself as "evil" or "dark." The higher-up Black Cloaks may be supernatural beings patterned after the grim reaper. lesser Black Cloaks are often cultists of some kind belonging to a secret circle of secrets or religion of evil.

The black cloak may have sleeves (making it technically a robe). A hood that conceals the face is often a required matching accessory.

Often Black Cloaks will wander around in public. nobody ever seems to question the people who are obviously concealing their identities. As with Stormtrooper armor, it's very easy for good guys to steal the uniform and walk around undetected in enemy territory, at least for a little while. Wearing a black cloak also signifies if a hero is dallying with the dark side, or is an anti-hero.

This is sometimes paired with a malevolent mask for extra creepiness.

Can overlap with ominous opera cape.

A sub-trope of evil wears black.

See good colors, evil colors.
