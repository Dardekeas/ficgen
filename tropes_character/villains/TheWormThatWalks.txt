Sometimes, when you want a really scary monster, a giant insect just won't do. They've been done to death and look really cheesy to boot. But you still want a bug monster — what do you do?

Well, you call this guy. He isn't just one bug — he's millions! Millions of tiny creepy crawlies make up his body, as if his entire body is composed of synchronized swarming controlled by a hive mind. Sometimes it's worms, sometimes it's insects — bees are always good — and sometimes it's just any creepy thing you can think of.

Villains like this aren't always the most lethal, but are often very hard to hurt. Trying to punch one is like trying to punch water (only far more disgusting). In some cases, they are almost impossible to kill, because if even one of the creatures that makes up its body survives, there is the possibility that it will return (though it may take a while). kill it with fire is often your best bet.

In real life, these are called colony organisms.

Could be considered an extreme of the totem pole trench. This trope is almost always combined with healing factor or even from a single maggot. Just don't confuse him with the worm guy, or earthworm jim, or the ghost who walks. one to million to one is a variant where a creature can become the swarm, but it isn't its common form. See also combining mecha for the mechanical counterpart of this trope.
