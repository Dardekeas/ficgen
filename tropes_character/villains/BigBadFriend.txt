The Hero is looking for answers, beating up bikers, paying off informants and searching through the great big library of everything. His best friend and partner pleads with him to stop, it won't bring "her" back, and it just puts him in danger. Yet still the hero persists.

A few acts later, he's getting beat on by the giant mook, it looks like it's all going to fade to black when... his partner shows up, gun in hand! Wait, why is he pointing the tranquilizer gun at hiâ€”

When he wakes up, the friend is terribly distraught. Says he tried to get him to stop, that he warned him what would happen. Saving him is out of his hands now, it's all on his head. Wait, what?The best friend has been in league with (or is) the big bad behind the whole plot. However, they genuinely like the hero and would rather he live a long and happy life. He might try a circling monologue to bring him onboard, but chances are he already knows the hero's moral code is such that he'd just be wasting both their time by doing it. Still, he just might try, for old time's sake. Compounding matters, he's usually a straw traitor to some horrible ideal, is either directly or indirectly responsible for much of the hero's recent suffering, and/or was covering it up.

Compare evil former friend. Contrast friendly enemy and living with the villain. not to be confused with another type of big bad friend. If the hero is being chummy with the big bad, that's go karting with bowser. evil all along is for anyone who turns out to be evil, not just friends. Related to they were holding you back.

This is a Spoiler Trope, so beware.
