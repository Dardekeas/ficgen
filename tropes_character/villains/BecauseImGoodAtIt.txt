Someone has a less than morally sound job, like a drug dealer, arms dealer, assassin, or lobbyist. They usually get into the job to make ends meet, especially if the job is illegal, but when they become financially sound or even get a legal job, they refuse to stop. Why? â€” because they're good at it. The fulfillment of being competent has surpassed the fulfillment of being a "good person." Or, they're willing (if in a legal job, like lobbyists) to let their job damage their personal lives and public facade for the simple reason of competence.

See also do wrong, right and punch clock villain. Compare evil virtues. Contrast reluctant warrior, who fights because he has to... and isn't necessarily good at it.
