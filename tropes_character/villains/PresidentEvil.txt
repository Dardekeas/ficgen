This supervillain doesn't just have an elaborate underground base, they have their own country, often a ruritania, banana republic, or qurac. Just like the evil overlord, but with an international scope. This affords them so many resources and so much power that the heroes often are never able to truly beat them.

Usually, the heroes aren't fighting against the country itself, apart from the occasional loyal citizen who's been turned into a super soldier. Their beef is strictly with the villain, and the country is usually just a convenient plot device.

The villain's leaderly reputation varies between villain with good publicity and 0% approval rating. Sometimes, the heroes go into the country and foment a rebellion to get the villain kicked out; naturally, this often leads to someone even worse stepping up (as with hitler's time travel exemption act) and an enemy mine storyline to restore the status quo. Or, the "oppressed masses" are actually gullible lemmings who like their leader, and might not be oppressed at all!

See also the caligula, which is this trope turned up to eleven, sans the Democracy. a different sort of president. Not to be confused with hoss delgado's appearance in the fictional video game within a show President Evil, or with the actual video game series Resident Evil.

In terms of the ranks of authority tropes, the tropes that are equal are god save us from the queen!, the woman wearing the queenly mask, and the high queen. The next steps down are the evil prince, prince charming, prince charmless, sheltered aristocrat, warrior prince, the wise prince, and all princess tropes. The next step up is the emperor.

If the president evil has the same name as a real life president or is an expy of a real life president, then this is demonization.

For very obvious reasons, no real life examples, please!
