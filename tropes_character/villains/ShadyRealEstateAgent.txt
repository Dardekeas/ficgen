A seemingly helpful character whose job is to help people like newlywed couples looking for their first home to find the best possible domicile, but whose personality practically screams "real estate fraud" to the viewer. Whether he's a real con man or just a really, really immoral entrepreneur, you can be sure that the characters will be cursed with leaking roofs and drafty windows as soon as they have signed the papers...Or worse.
