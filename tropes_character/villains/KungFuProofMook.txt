Some baddies aren't particularly dangerous, but they are annoying to deal with, because the usual tricks used by our heroes don't work on them. This kind of opponent proves difficult to be overcome by a hero who is used to fighting using a small repertoire of techniques. As such, these encounters force our heroes to think outside of the box. Mostly because it's cooler than showing them win fights the same way all of the time.

Common reasons for this include:

       Runs on the same principle as kryptonite is everywhere, as an attempt to avert boring invincible hero. May be overcome with attacks for massive damage. May be part of an elemental rock-paper-scissors system. back stab and one-hit kill are popular abilities to be immunised against. punch! punch! punch! uh oh... is a common consequence. Subtrope of no sell, supertrope to invincible minor minion which is this up to eleven. injured vulnerability is where you can break the Kung Fu Proofing by harming them enough.
