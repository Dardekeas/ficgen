This trope generally arises in situations where the hero and the big bad (or some other substitute boss villain) are staring each other down, ready to engage in mortal combat. The big bad challenges the Hero to a duel, but then instead of said fight being one-on-one, as the viewer and the Hero might expect, the villain promptly yells for his ... guards!

May result in the invocation of big damn heroes if the good guy is in too deep. Conversely, should the hero do better than expected, the villain may realize that he needs reinforcements and act accordingly. At any rate, the use of this trope can demonstrate that the villain is sufficiently dangerously genre savvy to know not to fight the hero one-on-one when he can bring in his minions to support him.

Can overlap with bait-and-switch boss in video games; however, more often the flunky boss fights alongside his mooks or at least remains present to observe the fight. May even cross-pollinate with summon bigger fish if the hero seriously outclasses the villain and/or the Mooks are sufficiently powerful in their own right.

The villain may be disappointed if the fight is subject to conservation of ninjutsu and/or mook chivalry, or if he's dealing with an invincible hero. This is the antitrope of leave him to me.
