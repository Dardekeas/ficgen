A Hanging Judge is a ruthless judge who rules his courtroom with an iron fist as his own personal fiefdom. He will hand out brutal sentences for the most minor infractions. He may be corrupt and using the law for his own ends, a corrupt hick using his power to dominate the local community, a knight templar who believes his punishments are justified, or a bully who gets off on abusing his power. Any hero who ends up hauled before him can expect no mercy and precious little justice. You better have an amoral attorney at your side when you confront the Hanging Judge in the courtroom, or it's guaranteed that you won't walk out as a free bird after the trial.

A subtrope of the judge. This character typically presides over a kangaroo court and can give longer than life sentences. See also the equally-bad joker jury.
