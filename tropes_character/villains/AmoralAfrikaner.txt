south africa: land of amazing varieties of wildlife, breathtaking mountain views, and one of the world's best rugby national teams.

However, fiction would have you believe that South Africa isn't much more than a spawn point for mercs and bloodthirsty military types, who are probably racist to boot.

There's a degree of truth to this: after the end of the apartheid era, the South African military and police forces downsized a lot, which left a lot of highly trained South African soldiers and paramilitary operators looking for jobsâ€”which they found as private military contractors. When those battle-hardened guys brought their Apartheid-era sensibilities to the table... well, look out.

Going back even further, the Boers (Dutch settlers in South Africa) fought a pair of unsuccessful uprisings against the ruling British Empire in the late 19th century, during which time the Boers coined the word "commando" (and during which time the British made use of concentration camps). Needless to say, there's a long tradition of brutal warfare in South Africa.

despite the title, this trope isn't only for Afrikaners (Dutch South Africans). It's possible for Rooineks (British South Africans) to be just as nasty. Even native black South Africans, such as those of Xhosa or Zulu descent, aren't exempt, but these are very rare in fiction and are more likely to show up under badass native or scary black man.

See south africa, second boer war, and the apartheid era for more information, south africans with surface-to-air missiles for the current military of South Africa, and private military contractors, former regime personnel, sociopathic soldier, bounty hunter, and hired guns for related tropes.
