undead mooks are the entire point of the zombie apocalypse. May be zombies, skeletons, or even mummies. An extreme form of faceless goons, in that while it's pretty hard to identify with someone with no face, it's basically impossible to sympathize with a corpse. May be spawned from clown car graveyards, which act as mook makers. They may need to be killed in a certain way, or may even be completely unkillable, getting back up every time. If there's a necromancer involved, defeating them may bring down this keystone army.

Sometimes the officer class will be made up of more strong-willed, sentient types of undead, such as vampires or wights. May be the official army of the necrocracy.

If you really want to find these guys, look in the designated big boo's haunt. raising the steaks is sometimes a sub-trope of this. They are a staple of video games, tabletop games, and live-action alike.

Compare everything's deader with zombies.
