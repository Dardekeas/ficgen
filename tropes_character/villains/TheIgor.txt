Igor is the sidekick and manservant to a mad scientist. He's an absolute toady, loyal to a fault, and has no problem doing unsanitary scut-work (such as grave robbing) for his genius master, who is always addressed as "master," sometimes with an impressive lisp. He'll typically be a hunchback, dwarf, or even some small variety of monster. evil sorcerers can substitute a tiny imp or demon. A vague european accent and/or a Peter Lorre impression (despite Lorre's not having played that sort of role until late in his dotage) round out the vocal category.

Igor can't fight (usually), and if encountered by the hero in a combat situation, will high-tail it out with or without his master, unless the master tries to sacrifice him to enhance his own chances. abduction of young screaming ladies, however, is within Igor's power.

This character is completely defined by Fritz, a character who appears in the 1931 universal pictures adaptation of Frankenstein. (He does not appear in the book; he was imported from an 1832 play adaptation, Presumption: or the Fate of Frankenstein.) the name "igor" comes from a similar character named ygor (played by bela lugosi) who appeared in the second sequel, Son of Frankenstein. Most modern uses and references include at least a subtle twist. justified for works set during the steam age or earlier, as the logical choice of dumb muscle for a mad scientist would be a deformed, despised and illiterate guy nobody would listen to if he decided to snitch his master and also who would be cheap.

A very stylized, specialized, and specific variant on the renfield. Is often working for a body upgrade. Can overlap with satellite character. Compare to battle butler, crusty caretaker and professional butt-kisser.
