Going into your neighbor's yard is a death wish. The milkman, the mailman, even the kid who lost his Frisbee disc doesn't want to go in there, because that neighbor has an Angry Guard Dog.

Most of the bigger breeds of dog have been used for security jobs, especially Dobermans, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, and Pit Bulls. You also have different types of dogs that are supposed to guard whatever, such as a watchdog (who is simply required to bark, so even mister muffykins would do), a guard dog (who merely has to look imposing, like a Mastiff) and an attack dog (who has to be athletic and very trainable). Your stereotypical Angry Guard Dog, on the other hand, is all three. It looks intimidating, and if you enter its territory it will bark, but only on the way to mauling you. This dog's bite is every bit as bad as its bark.

Ironically, few Angry Guard Dogs are pitbulls. This has less to do with emulating realism and dodging current stereotypes than with indicating the old age of this trope. Bull terriers were highly regarded during the World War II era, and considering current media trends, no one wants to really highlight them in an opinionated way. And strangely enough, while bulldogs tend to be used in media for this trope, they tend to be one of the worst suited breeds for guard dogs in real life, due to their amiable disposition and poor athletic ability.

A pack of these (usually three or more, and usually Dobermans) is standard issue for any scrapyard or vehicle impound lot, while any big fancy house worth its salt will have them chained up and ready for the master to snarl "release the hounds".

Nowadays, the trope is mostly found in cartoons. They occasionally subvert it, showing the dog is a big softie and/or coward if confronted, with the aesop that a bully's bark is always worse than his bite.See also right-hand attack dog.

Contrast big friendly dog, they have the scent. Neutralized by scare the dog. Sometimes named fluffy.
