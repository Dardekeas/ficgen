Some people grow old gracefully, and sit back to enjoy the last few years of their life. Others want to spend their final days as the supreme ruler of all humanity. Not all senior citizens can be kind, loving grandparents, or old masters. Some are just as evil in their old age as they were in their youth, and still want to destroy everything, conquer the world, or generally be evil.

To qualify for this trope, a character must be old (by their species' standards), and must also be visibly aged. Even if they're really 700 years old, it doesn't count if they look like a ten-year-old child. Just being a cranky old man is not enough to qualify one as evil, either. World domination, death to humans, or anything else that could be pulled off by younger villains are all suitable goals to make one qualify as an Evil Old Folk. If they happen to be really old and remain young by stealing the youth of others, it can count so long as they occasionally look old.

So next time Mr. Jenkins next door yells at you to get off his lawn, you might want to listen â€” he might be hiding a death laser under his rocking chair.

Due to their age and the fact that they are still committing evil, they are never likely to go face on the sorting algorithm of face heel turning chart.
