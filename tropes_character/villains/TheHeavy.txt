The Heavy is the antagonist whose direct actions are the primary focus of the storyline. This is a big role for an actor, if not the largest role, in a play or movie. The term, which goes back to theater in the 1800s, refers to this player having the most lines and thus the heaviest script.

This can be the big bad, but is also often the dragon, since keeping the big bad mysterious generally makes him scarier. This is especially true in the case of a non-action big bad. In the original Star Wars trilogy, Emperor Palpatine may be the big bad, but Darth Vader is the plot driver. He's seen more. He has more to do. He dominates the films, and as the prequels prove, the story is about him.

Actors often cast in such parts are known for "playing the heavy."

Compare dragon-in-chief, which is when the dragon fills this role specifically because he overshadows the big bad as a threat. Likely to intersect with villains act, heroes react. If they railroad the plot too strongly, it may result in a pinball protagonist.

Do not confuse with the heavy weapons guy, who is the big guy. Or the band.
