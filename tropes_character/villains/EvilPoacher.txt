Be aware! The wild is just filled with Evil Poachers willing to murder any human who gets in their way. Poaching means any illegal hunting, but Hollywood poachers only hunt endangered species, such as cute panda babies or meddling kids.

Many Evil Poachers have no motivation to hunt and threaten people other than to be evil. They are like the evil polluters in Captain Planet who never manufacture anything. If Evil Poachers do get a motive, it will probably be selling their prey on the black market.

Evil Poachers are villains by default in a kids wilderness epic, a genre in which they tend to end up as slapstick idiots dressed in scary animal skins.

In real life, most poachers are poor people trying to get out of poverty; they are unable to afford a license. This is also a major reason why poor poachers will often target endangered animals - the rarity of their parts increases the value. However, they do often shoot at park rangers if they encounter them (they're the reason why most rangers in Africa are heavily armed) and are often hired by people in organized crime. There are some illegal trophy hunters as well, ranging from amateurs hunting without a license and off-season to wanting the glory of getting a rare animal.

The inversion, roguish poacher, is most common in older works, particularly fairy tales and folk music. The roguish poacher always hunts for food (usually for his starving family) and lives in a peter rabbit-vs-farmer macgregor kind of relationship with the evil fatcat landowner. Compare karmic thief.

A sister trope to the egomaniac hunter. Compare with cruella to animals. Contrast the hunter trapper, who hunts and traps legally and is much more likely to be reasoned with, the roguish poacher, this guy's justified criminal counterpart, and the great white hunter, the heroic counterpart.
