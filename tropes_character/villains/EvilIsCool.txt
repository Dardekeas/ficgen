There is a reason actors fight for the chance to play the bad guy. The lines are great, the costumes are awesome, the songs are spectacular, the villains often look much sexier than the heroes, and they don't have to spend the whole shoot pretending they are nicer than anyone they've ever met.

Plus, there are all those wonderful toys!

Why is all that true? Why does the bad guy get all the cool stuff? The more interesting the bad guy, the more interesting the story. It really is that simple. You don't have a story unless you have conflict. The bad guy in most cases is the conflict.

Plus, there are all those marvelous toys... Wait, we already said that.

Compare good is boring. Contrast this is your brain on evil and being evil sucks. See also balance between good and evil. Ignore good feels good, those traitors don't know what they're talking about. Those wonderful... Ahhh, forget it. The reason love to hate exists. dark is not evil, noble demons, and some types of anti heroes are able to harness the coolness of evil without the actual evil. Compare the subtrope damn it feels good to be a gangster when criminals are consciously portrayed as cool by the work itself. See also draco in leather pants for when this trope is a fandom reaction.

ooh, look,
