Sometimes the big bad gets bored doing everything himself. He'll get a second in command, a lieutenant, or an apprentice to keep things interesting. This is the rule of two. There are two big bosses, and both have to be taken down. If the hero is about to take the dragon down, expect the big bad to try to turn him to the dark side. If the dragon is about to take the hero down, expect him to offer an alliance to overthrow the big bad and take his place. Compare and contrast big bad duumvirate, deceptive disciple and bastard understudy.
