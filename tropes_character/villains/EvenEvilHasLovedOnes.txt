Being evil doesn't always mean negative emotions 24/7 against everything and everyone. Even evil characters (and real people) can feel and show love. Often, that love is twisted, a cause for villainy, or an act but sometimes a work can show an evil character's love is genuine and deep. This serves to humanize the character, to give the hero doubts about fighting him/her, or to provide a weakness for the hero to exploit. At an extreme end, can provoke mama bear or papa wolf reactions if they are threatened, or prompt the loved ones to avenging the villain.

even bad men love their mamas and unholy matrimony are subtropes.

Compare even evil has standards, morality pet, mad scientist's beautiful daughter, daddy's little villain, villainous friendship. If the evil character in question is a mook, and said love brings them in conflict with their own boss, that's even mooks have loved ones. Can often overlap with moral myopia when the villain sees no problem with their own methods, until those methods are turned on the ones THEY love.
