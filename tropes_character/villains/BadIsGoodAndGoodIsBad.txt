A common trait of card carrying villains.

Sometimes it isn't enough for a villain to be evil. They have to prove their evilness by eschewing all that is good and embracing all that is bad. They'll eat foods that disgust the good guys and laugh at funerals. They may also carry this over to their speech, making sure to only use negative phrases when most people would use a normal one, and correcting themselves if they "slip" ("Oh, goody! I mean, 'baddy.'") They'll kick puppies for sport, and describe things as repulsive like it's a good thing. They often describe sunny weather as depressing. They may be plagued by a minion with an f in evil.

Makes your head a splode if you think about it too much.

Can also be why evil cannot comprehend good.

See nightmare fetishist for the non-evil version. Not to be confused with so bad, it's good.

Compare above good and evil and what is evil?. Villains whose strong point is not logic will sometimes use both tropes to justify this. See also bizarro universe and blue and orange morality.
