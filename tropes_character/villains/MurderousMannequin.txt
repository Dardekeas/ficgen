A sister trope to demonic dummy, the Murderous Mannequin is a clothing mannequin brought to life and sent to kill. Like mecha-mooks, a hero can be shown cutting down swathes of these without moral qualm as they are 'not truly alive.'

Also make for excellent paranoia fuel â€” they're everywhere, and they're staring at you.

Like the creepy doll, demonic dummy, and perverse puppet, part of the eeriness is down to the uncanny valley.
