That kindly old European man who lives at the end of the street, who tends his garden and waves at you with a smile when you walk by? Yeah. Seems he has a dark secret. Back during world war ii he was a card-carrying member of die nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei and a fervent supporter of adolf hitler and all the man stood for.

But that was then. Now? Now he's an old, and very bitter, Nazi.

If they're living incognito in some other country (usually the United States), it's not uncommon for them to be the target of nazi hunters who have found out his true identity.

A very specific sub-trope of grumpy old man. Married to the racist grandma. Related to retired monster.

For obvious reasons, evolved into a stock character in german media, in serious works, but often also played for laughs, where the joke is for example that he seems to be oblivious to the fact that his attitude isn't acceptable at all in mainstream society anymore. See also racist grandma.
