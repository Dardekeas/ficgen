Science created the atom bomb, it unleashes monsters, it angers the gods â€” science is bad. As a corollary to this, intelligence in media is often used for evil, or belongs to the mad scientist.

At least half of the characters in comic books whose names begin with "Doctor" are evil. Even the good Doctors are often weird, being prone to mad science, a blind pursuit of forbidden knowledge, or proving their critics wrong.

Actual practicing medical doctors are usually exempt from the evil evil title, probably because it's hard not to get behind a surgeon or doctor who actively works at saving people's lives, even if they're a jerk. Those who aren't in a medical drama tend to get less slack on this... In a nutshell, it's a mitigating factor, not an exception. (See "mad doctor")

Interestingly, it's actually possible to get a doctorate in the study of evil. The field is called Ponerology, although very few universities actually offer such a degree. Definitely issued by the academy of evil.

Compare mad scientist, which is often synonymous with this, as is evil genius. When they're not that kind of doctor, there's overlap with aristocrats are evil, in that the title is an indicator. Not to be confused with morally ambiguous ducktorate (though it's also related to evil).

A dentist is technically a doctor, but see depraved dentist for examples of when they turn evil or insane.
