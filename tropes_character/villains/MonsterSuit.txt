The time has come, and after much journeying and many plot twists, the heroes are finally going to face the big bad. Unfortunately, there's a problem: said big bad is much stronger than they ever could have imagined. Its power is monstrous, its defenses impenetrable, and no matter what they do, the heroes can't so much as get it to flinch. Despair and woe, the villain has triumphed! His victory is assured!

But wait! All is not lost! Upon closer inspection, the heroes realize that this monster isn't the real big bad. The real one is actually inside, pulling the strings. Bonus, he's puny, and could probably be knocked over by a stiff breeze (also, provided the heroes didn't bring one of those along, a big sword). After that, the heroes find themselves faced with the much simpler task of tearing through the faux-Big Bad, reaching the real one, and slicing it to bits. Once again, convenience saves the day!

This trope occurs primarily in Japanese media, for whatever reason, but has been known to crop up in Western fiction from time to time. Similar to mobile-suit human, except slightly more dedicated. The faux-Big Bad could also be considered the dragon after the reveal.
