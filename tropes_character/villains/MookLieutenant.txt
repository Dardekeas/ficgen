It's not very leader like to give orders yourself when you're trying to rule the world. Whilst you leave the hunting of the macguffin to your champion and the creation of the world ending device to your mad scientist, who's leading your legions of terror? That's where the mook lieutenant comes in.

The Mook lieutenant is the commanding officer of the evil army. He will be seen in the background to give orders, ask boneheaded questions about the weather controlling device and give the big bad someone to talk to when the dragon is a man (or woman) of few words. Very rarely in for the evulz, he's normally a career military man who views the heroes as rabble and does not question orders. Has a high mortality rate where failure is concerned. More often than not he will look exactly like any other Mook, except that whilst all the other Mooks are wearing masks, the mook lieutenant will not."Lieutenant" here refers to the position of right hand man in general, rather than a specific rank.
