We've all heard about them: Lazy, incompetent, always passing the buck, and more than willing to accept a bribe to "speed things up". This character type exists somewhere in the overlap between punch clock villains and obstructive bureaucrats. They are only lazy and incompetent when it prevents them from getting any work done, however. If someone threatens their position or privileges, they forget about laziness and incompetence and become relentless in abusing their power. They are not above committing murder itself, of crossing the moral event horizon, if their cushy jobs are at risk or they have the object of their ambition within reach.

This type of villain usually does not belong to the aristocracy or get power from money or businesses. Instead, the power comes from a position on the government (usually obtained through personal favors rather than merits or hard work). Compare dirty cop.
