The hero has a secret identity, and so does the villain. On the days that they're not battling, they live or work uncomfortably close to one another - or at least it would be uncomfortable if they only knew who that guy across the room really was. But each one simply doesn't recognize the other one when the costumes are off (as if the voice wouldn't give it away in seconds). Often, they're even best friends or even dating in their uncostumed lives while fighting tooth and nail when in a cowl. Sometimes one of them is aware of it, but chooses not to do anything whether due to manipulation, confidence, or not wanting to touch off a simmering powder keg.

They don't always live together; heroes and villains may work for the same company or go to the same school.

the reveal tends to be... messy.

Compare enforced cold war, where the two sides know that each is the enemy, but are forced to co-exist anyway; go karting with bowser, where the two sides know that each is the enemy and are friends in spite of it; and keeping the enemy close, where one side holds the other within close proximity so they can't catch them off-guard, not to mention when one within their own ranks is a potential traitor. cain and abel and dating catwoman can be subsets of this.
