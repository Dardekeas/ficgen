An interesting twist on conventional storytelling is to make the big bad the plot's protagonist. Sometimes (but not always), this villainous main character will even get the sympathetic p.o.v.. On the other hand, it is not necessary for a villain to be sympathetic for them to be this trope. They simply need to be a villain whose morally reprehensible actions (however well-intentioned) are in no way glossed over or justified within the context of the story. We are seeing the story from the big bad's point of view.

A Villain Protagonist (especially in a comedy) is quite likely to go down in flames at the end. Whether this counts as a downer ending or not generally depends on how many dogs they kick along the way and/or how entertaining their humiliation conga or karmic death is. They may also do a heel-face turn and become a hero protagonist.

When this is done for one episode, it's a villain episode.

This trope often overlaps with a nominal hero and/or sociopathic hero, and sometimes with the more extreme cases of an unsympathetic comedy protagonist.

Not to be confused with the byronic hero, who is simply a deeply flawed person, heroic or not. Many Byronic Heroes tend to zone in and out of Villain Protagonist territory, though.

Contrast hero antagonist, both in terms of morality and role in the story. Compare and contrast villain antagonist and hero protagonist.
