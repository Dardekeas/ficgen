A potential villain who is consistently a failure or never gets the respect that he thinks he deserves, and may even be angry that the heroes don't take him seriously.

He may not necessarily be inept or have a laughably mild idea of what counts as villainy. villain decay is usually too simple an explanation. This is sometimes a relative situation, and the hero's rogues gallery just happens to include people more showy, better financed, or just plain scarier than him.

This does not mean that he doesn't bear animosity; that's a punch clock villain. He's probably jumping at the opportunity to outdo his rivals and the hero. But there is something about his perseverance or attitude about the whole thing that is just short of sympathetic.May also be a determinator out of necessity or overlap with draco in leather pants. If they get even more pathetic in regard to the hero, unknown rivalry looms. Just watch out, they may suddenly turn out to be a not-so-harmless villain.

video game versions of this trope frequently overlap with the goldfish poop gang if they are just as pathetic in actual battle as they're treated by the story. They may maintain threat status if conservation of competence allows them to keep competent supporters.

The evil counterpart to failure hero. Arguably a subtrope of boisterous weakling.
