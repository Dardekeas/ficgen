The bad guys from The Bible are well known and as such don't require introduction, and everyone knows they are evil. The really handy thing is that many of them are regularly theorized to be cursed with immortality as part of their punishment for being bad guys, providing a decent reason for them to show up in any time period.

Note: satan, god is evil, and the horsemen of the apocalypse have their own tropes.

Note 2: Simply sharing a name with any of these is symbolic, but not enough for a character to qualify. They have to actually be the same person as the one in The Bible to be this trope. If the name is the only connection, see names to run away from: biblical names. See also the name of cain and the descendants of cain.
