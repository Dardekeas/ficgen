This trope deals with individual stories from a series/franchise that feature several members of the series'/franchise's rogues gallery. These tales don't necessarily fall under villain team-up or legion of doom, although there's considerable overlap; they just involve stories in which a lot of villains appear, whether they're working together or not. Writers sometimes refer to these stories as "gang bangs", a name best avoided because of the unfortunate implications.

Video game adaptations of comic book properties tend to indulge in this to take advantage of the source material's rich rogues gallery.
