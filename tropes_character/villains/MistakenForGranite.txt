Obviously, guarding the macguffin is a hard job, especially if you are a 4000 year old civilization. Booby traps can be dodged, guards require resources, and curses can be awesome. So why not just use the obligatory scary statues as guards?

This trope refers to times when an important room has statues around it which seem like normal statues, if perhaps heavily armed. However, upon something important happening, the statues will come to life and start attacking. If the work in question is a video game, the statues will most likely respond to an attack. One way to gain these for your room is to take people for granite.
