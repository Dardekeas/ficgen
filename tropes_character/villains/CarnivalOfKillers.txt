A Carnival Of Killers occurs when a villain either hires the best assassins from around the world and sends them after the hero, or offers an open bounty on the hero's head that attracts a variety of assassins. A typical Carnival Of Killers will involve a large collection of assassins with radically different styles (e.g. a cold sniper, a knife nut, a mad bomber, etc), and sometimes will include last season villains that have since fallen below the sorting algorithm of evil's current threshold. Sometimes one of the assassins will decide the best way to win the bounty is to take out the competition before taking out the hero.

Compare legion of doom and quirky miniboss squad. Not comparable to circus of fear, unless being chased by the worlds top assassins posing as clowns is the hero's worst fear.
