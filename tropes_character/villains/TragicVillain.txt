From the villains wiki:

A type of anti-villain and the ultimate deconstruction of the villain, a Tragic Villain is completely aware of their evil but takes little (if any) pleasure from it. Rather, they feel compelled to engage in evil due to circumstances beyond their control.

A common form of Tragic Villain is one who has his heel realization after crossing the moral event horizon: he has no hope of redemption, so despite my master, right or wrong, he continues to follow orders. A knight templar who stops attacking potential rebels may realize how his orders are doing more wrong than right, but the side of good will never take him... there's no turning back from where he is standing.

Or maybe a hero was forced to commit a necessary evil, and never forgave themselves, deciding they were now a villain beyond hope/not deserving of salvation or redemption, possibly becoming a death seeker in the process.

May also be a tragic monster; there is strong overlap. a prime candidate for redemption, but also everything associated. Compare to well-intentioned extremist, who commits evil actions in hopes of producing good results. Also compare byronic hero, who is a similarly sympathetic but flawed and morally conflicted character, except portrayed as a hero rather than a villain. Overlaps with woobie, destroyer of worlds when their destruction is a result of the extreme mistreatment they have endured.
