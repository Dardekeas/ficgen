With the fall of communism in Europe, Russia lost some of its villain status, so writers were stuck on how to find evil Russians with mnogo nukes on hand. Because, frankly, there's no one else with cruise missile subs and carriers for the US to fight. And if you try to set up the conflict in a work of fiction as yanks with tanks versus chinese with chopper support, suddenly you've gone and alienated one of the largest markets in the world.

There are two solutions: renegade russian, or Make the Bear Angry Again.

The latter is where Russia stays in its authoritarian military democracy, or ditches that silly "democracy" bit altogether, and grows increasingly aggressive, possibly reabsorbing the post-Soviet states as some sort of a Rebuilt Soviet Union, Eurasian Empire, or something equally scary sounding. This allows Russia to start attacking places again and being generally assertive. Probably will not involve actual bears, unless russia decides to get serious this time.

More or less truth in television: while diplomatic relations between United States and Russia did improve after the end of the cold war, antagonism still exists between the said two countries. It should be noted that things got a bit more sour when vladimir putin came into play. As of his latest term in his revolving-door presidency, 3/4 of a trillion dollars has been marked for the modernization of the Russian military (as well as the adoption of more modern conscription system). Meanwhile, Poland and Norway have started investing billions into their armed forces, and the european union is setting up two multinational divisions, the Nordic, and Visegrad battle-groups.

This trope is also played with in some Russian fiction; it's close to playing it straight, but of course it's not viewed as a bad thing.

Compare/Contrast the great politics mess-up, why we are bummed communism fell.
