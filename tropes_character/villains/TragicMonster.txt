When a background character becomes a monster, you generally don't care. You just watch the protagonist wipe the floor with them like they're nothing. But what happens when it's a character that the hero has come to love and care about over the course of the work?

Nothing can wrench the gut of any protagonist like being forced to fight a loved one or ally (except maybe if said loved one is weeping uncontrollably and begging for death as he/she tries to kill you). This isn't just brainwashed and crazy, this is forcing the unlucky character to become a terrible beast or other nasty critter with no means of changing them back. Not that it will tend to stop the heroes from trying. In many case the hero will do everything they can to avoid staking the loved one. Even if it means keeping them contained for their own safety while they hunt for a cure.

In many works, this can amount to a form of player punch. It's par for the course for any zombie apocalypse, since doubtless somebody important is going to get turned into a zombie.

May bring dying as yourself into play.

If a loved one must kill the monster, see staking the loved one. For cases when it's only a monster imitating a loved one, that's shape shifter guilt trip.

Compare interrupted cooldown hug and "i know you're in there somewhere" fight.

Not to be confused with a tortured monster, although they can overlap.
