For some reason, writers seem to like to use the name "Roy" or "Leroy" to name a less than lovable character - either as an out and out villain or as the butt monkey of the story. This is perhaps because the name comes from the word "Royal", and therefore could sound like the name of a privileged person who needs to be taken down a peg or two.

Named for Evil Roy Slade, a TV movie about a wanted outlaw.
