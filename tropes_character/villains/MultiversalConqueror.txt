Sometimes an evil overlord, galactic conqueror, dimension lord, demon lord, archdevil, physical god of evil or eldritch abomination decides there's only one evil goal big enough that suits him - bring the multiverse to its knees. Not only our Earth, but every dimension, every alternate reality, every single planet and life form in the whole multiverse. He may want to conquer it. Or he might want to destroy it. In both cases he's the ultimate threat, more powerful than anyone else our heroes has ever met. He can destroy planets, blow up entire cities with one finger, erase whole dimensions. To show how strong he is he can even kill the guardian of the multiverse, very first person that will oppose him. And when he says a god am i, he's being modest. Fighting with him is usually our hero's greatest task ever. To defeat him there's usually a gathering of the greatest army of heroes that multiverse has ever seen. If he comes back after being defeated he will most likely be a shadow of his old self.

Is often used as an original generation villain or a legion of doom for a intercontinuity crossover.

Compare with omnicidal maniac.

This is one of the two highest-ranking authority tropes, the other being guardian of the multiverse. The next rank down is dimension lord.

Note: Technically, the Universe means everything in existence, so if two "universes" have any connection, they are one universe. "Dimension" would be more accurate for a parallel "universe", but this is one of those comic book things you have to let slide. (Although some modern physical cosmological models, such as M-Theory, are beginning to dispense with the classical definition of a universe as "everything" and are now more adapting to the definition of "one everything". science marches on.)
