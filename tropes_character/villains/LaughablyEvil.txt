Villains can be many things... magnificent, horrific, self-obsessed, philosophical... but special attention goes to the villain that makes you laugh. It might be because he's an idiot, it might be that you empathize with him, or it might be simply that his actions are so unexpected. In any case, some villains will always be funny.

Of course, funny does not always equal weak. Praise be to the villain who can cause a chuckle from his audience, right before viciously thwarting the hero's best efforts. In fact, if done correctly, the very things that make a villain qualify can make them downright disturbing once they begin crossing the moral event horizon. Villain laughing at faking someone out with a gun with a "bang!" flag coming out? Funny. Same villain doing the exact same laugh when shooting them for real a few seconds later? Creepy. A truly well written one can manage to pull off both at once. See the trope picture for an excellent example of this subtype. Just because a character qualifies, it does not prevent them from being a complete monster and there are many villains that manage to be both. In these cases, what makes them funny also makes them very unsettling because of how much fun they have committing the most horrific acts possible.

Often overlaps with the harmless villain (Harmless Villains are inherently funny, but funny villains are not inherently harmless), affably evil (get the joke?), faux affably evil (who are often funny), the ineffectual sympathetic villain and magnificent bastard. And with large ham (playing a villain seems to be very fun). It's also a prerequisite for the terrible trio and the quirky miniboss squad. Contrast with monster clown, because clowns make people cry. Interestingly, this either subverts or complements evil has a bad sense of humor, as does too funny to be evil, a closely related sister trope. Tends to be the sort who crosses the line twice.
