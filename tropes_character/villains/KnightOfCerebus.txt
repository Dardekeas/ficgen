In order to add more drama to a series which has been, up until that moment, lighthearted and comedic in nature, a villain (or antagonist of some sort) is introduced and is portrayed as a genuine threat, in contrast to the bumbling and comedic villains the heroes have faced before.

This villain's arrival is usually heralded by a sudden downturn in humor, to show the audience this guy means business. In other words, a catalyst for a drastic change in mood toward the dark and dramatic.

In shows that are generally lighter and softer, said villain may have some light-hearted or comical traits, but still gives a much higher sense of dread and genuine threat to the heroes than previous adversaries. Some cases of the trope may be harder to define by comparison in a particularly ineffective rogues gallery, though a clear cut example at the very least can actually place the protagonist in real danger compared to the harmless villain that poked his poodle in a previous arc. A typical symptom of cerebus syndrome.

A Knight of Cerebus is very likely to be dangerously genre savvy, but also runs the risk of becoming a villain sue. Arguably a subtrope of threshold guardians. See also dead serious, not-so-harmless villain. The show may shoo out the clowns first. Often, this results in a case of vile villain, saccharine show. When this kicks off cerebus syndrome, his arrival is a gut punch. Sometimes, this type of character can be a complete monster if they have no redeeming traits and do terrible things by the standards of history in an initially more lighthearted series.
