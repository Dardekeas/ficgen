In the natural progression of the sorting algorithm of evil, a stronger big bad will replace the previous villain for the new season. However, what happens if the previous villain is still here? One of the things the former big bad can do now is to work for the new big bad as his dragon. This is Demoted to Dragon in a nutshell.

Demoted Big Bads will almost always become the starscream or a dragon with an agenda.

Contrast dragon ascendant, the inverse, and big bad duumvirate, when the previous big bad isn't explicitly subservient to the new one. See also big bad wannabe.
