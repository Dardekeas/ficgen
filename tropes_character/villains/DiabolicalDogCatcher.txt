A forgotten trope, this trope describes an animal control agent who enjoy their job a little too much. He/she gets a sick thrill out of capturing stray dogs, imprisoning them and even putting the poor things down. A tag won't matter to these people and are likely to get rid of it so they can get the satisfaction their prisoners are not going to good homes and loving families.

Not a very popular trope among actual (modern day) dog catchers, who are more concerned about taking good care of stray animals and finding them a good home. This may have been more truth in television in the past, however, due to values dissonance on animal welfare.
