These human characters not only agree that humans are worthless scum, but think this makes it absolutely justified to slaughter a few innocent humans now and then. They may even desire the destruction of the entire human raceâ€”with themselves probably excepted.

Sometimes, they tend to be straw character malthusians who want to "solve overpopulation" or restore the planet to its "natural" (i.e., non-human) state.

More commonly, they appear during an alien invasion or its rough fantasy equivalent, believing in the superiority of the invaders. As such, they probably belong to les collaborateurs, and expect to be rewarded with overlordship of the surviving humans. This version of the trope is common in the sci-fi "alien invasion" serial films of the 40s and 50s wherein there was always a human collaborator who never seemed to mind that his actions, if successful, would bring about the destruction of his home and everyone/thing he knows.

Nonhuman characters who believe in the moral bankruptcy of their own species may be presented in equivalent ways, but they tend instead to be the more sympathetic my species doth protest too much.

A subtrope of boomerang bigot. Compare straw nihilist, transhuman treachery, hates everyone equally, hobbes was right.
