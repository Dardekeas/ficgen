A villain joins the Nazis during world war ii, impresses adolf hitler enough to get his own squadron/unit, then uses these resources for his own gain. This villain often sees Hitler as just another obstacle to overcome later. This trope also works if you substitute Hitler/Nazis with any other historical dictator (joseph stalin, Kim Jong-Il, Pol Pot, etc.), but those examples are less prevalent.

Expect stupid jetpack hitler or ghostapo if the villain in question comes from the future or has access to mystical powers.

Compare/contrast with dragon with an agenda; here you don't need to be the dragon, and with this trope you get an instantly recognizable yardstick of evil for the villain to compare himself to and to rob of funds.
