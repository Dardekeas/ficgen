So, the villain has taken a hostage, and to make sure the hero understands that this is serious, the villain is holding the hostage off a roof, or over some other height. Usually, in this case, the villain just has one simple, quick request: they want the code, or the macguffin, or the hero's surrender. The hero gives in to the demand. And then says something along the lines of "Now let him/her go!".

Poor choice of words, it turns out, because just this once, the villain is going to comply. Immediately and literally. They let go, and the hostage goes plummeting towards whatever they were being held over.

This happens so reliably that asking a villain to let a dangling hostage go, without being very specific, probably qualifies you as genre blind. Even so, this trope is almost always played completely straight. We can only conclude that the sight of a hostage held in the air is the hero's cue to grab the idiot ball. Typically, the hostage will survive, but it may require a very well timed big damn heroes moment, or just plain luck.

Variations can occur, as particularly cunning villains may find other, less obvious ways to turn a demand that a hostage be released into a request to kill them. antiheroes have their own special variation, where they hold a bad guy over a ledge to get information, and then, when the bad guy demands he be let go... well, you know the rest. Sometimes someone's plea to let them go starts at a survivable drop and quickly turns negatory once they get higher up.

This can be a type of literal cliffhanger. For pretty much the exact opposite trope, see take my hand. The extremely literal version of a villain complying with you said you would let them go. And the extremely literal version of this would be an arm and a leg.
