An Ambassador's job is two-fold: to maintain healthy relationships with the country he is sent to, and to be well-versed in the customs and minutiae of their culture. The Ass in Ambassador forgets this. He is rude, makes no attempt to do as the Romans do, and shows little sign of being friendly (or even respectful) at all. Even attempts by his staff at tactful translation rarely undo the harm he causes. As a result the other ambassadors or representatives are forced to bend over backwards and take every insult or unreasonable request, because if they ever decide to resist for one moment, the ambassador will be immediately insulted and threaten to break all ties.

A variant on this is an ambassador who is friendly, but perhaps too much. They are eager to learn the customs of the new culture and are constantly asking questions. While not mean, they seemed to have skipped the chapter that teaches about personal space, privacy, and uncomfortable questions.

See diplomatic impunity for when ambassadors are outright criminals. A subtrope of poor communication kills. When the Ambassador is trying to be good, but his government's spies are doing everything he says they wouldn't do, it's right hand versus left hand. Contrast (hopefully) ambadassador.
