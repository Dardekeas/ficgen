Dwarfs (not that kind, the real kind) in fiction are fairly uncommon. When they do show up, they tend to be either comic relief or playing a fantasy creature. But then, there's these guys.

The Depraved Dwarf is a pint-sized bucket of malice. He (and it's pretty much always a he) is either a sadistic psychopath, a twisted rapist, or at the very least a violent, cold-blooded criminal. Can go hand in hand with the napoleon, if the Depraved Dwarf's misanthropy is implied to be a response - albeit blown out of proportion - to discrimination and abuse faced as a result of their short stature.

They tend to show up when the hero has been rendered helpless. Often, expect giggling.

If he's the don or a similar leadership role, see mister big.

Contrast little people are surreal.

For villains with other disabilities, see evil albino and evil cripple.
