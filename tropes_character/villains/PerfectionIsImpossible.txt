A common motivation of villains is the perfectly understandable desire for a perfect worldâ€”one where their little sister wasn't murdered and people are all nice to each other, a world where everyone ascribes to their political philosophy. A work is usually set as they try to achieve it, with the protagonists opposing, or after their goals have had some measure of success, and the protagonist has to make others see how imperfect it is.

The reasons perfection is impossible are myriad- existence becomes boring, people are chaotic and changing them is either impossible or requires fundamentally changing them, such as instrumentality. The most basic reason is that everyone has a different perception of perfect.

Occasionally, even though the characters feel they have found perfection it may not jibe with what the audience would consider perfect, requiring euthanasia or some other societal taboo.

Sometimes the point will be made that while perfection is a worthy objective, it is an inherently unattainable one and any who claim to have found it are deluding themselves.
