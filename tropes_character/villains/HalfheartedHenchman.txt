The opposing side is fleshed out by being given one or two one-off henchmen, not unlike the ones you usually fight, but having them slack off, have no motivation, and complain about it to their coworkers. Sometimes they honestly suck, but sometimes, they just don't care. All that matters is that it's their job, and they're bad at it. Compare minion with an f in evil who are more enthusiastic, but also more clueless.

Compare those two bad guys and mauve shirt, who are part of the main cast rather than one-off characters and who tend to be more dangerous and sometimes more dedicated.
