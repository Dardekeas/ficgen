The heroes seemed to have defeated the ultimate villain but then the player realizes that they're on the first disc of a multi-disc RPG (or the audience realizes that the show is only in midseason). He's not the final boss; he might look like it, but he's defeated long before the story ends. They are the driving force in this early part, but they are not the ultimate threat. The real villain, the man behind the man, will show up later. Or maybe this guy will take a break to get your guard down, then come back and go all one-winged angel on you pitiful, mortal fools. This may lead to the plot being hijacked by ganon. This may also lead to you can't thwart stage one.

A cross between a red herring and the dragon, with a little bit of your princess is in another castle thrown in. It takes its name from the video game trope of a final boss, not a management figurehead â€” as much fun as it'd be to find your boss's boss is bringing about the Apocalypse. See also disc one final dungeon. Compare decoy protagonist and sacrificial lion. Likely to also be a climax boss.

Spoilers abound, obviously.
