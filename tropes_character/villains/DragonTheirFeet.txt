So we have a big bad, and he has his dragon. The plot unfolds as our heroes do what heroes do. Laughs are had, tears are shed, and finally they reach the end of their quest.

Somehow along the way, though, they missed the Dragon. Then the Dragon turns up. He's not the man in front of the man, he just wasn't around when the Big Bad went down. Sometimes there's a reason for it, but sometimes... he's just absent. He was dragon his feet.

His motives for persisting in going after the heroes can vary. He might be out for revenge for his murdered boss, he might have an agenda all his own, or he might simply have not got the memo that his side's already lost.

May result in a post-climax confrontation, or a dragon ascendant if the heroes are really unlucky.
