Sometimes when the heroes defeat the big bad, he goes down gracefully. Sometimes he tries to take the heroes with him. Sometimes the villain is so badass he just won't stop fighting until he's deader than dead. This trope is not about those villains.

smug snakes, dirty cowards, and bad guys who suffer from villain decay rarely go down with their heads held high. They're much more likely to get on their hands and knees and beg for mercy. This also serves to contrast them with the hero, as heroes usually don't beg for mercy from the villain in the opposite situation, at least not for themselves. Very rarely, it's the act of a noble demon who is consistent about offering his foes mercy, and expects the favour to be returned. Depending on where the hero is on the sliding scale of idealism versus cynicism, they might call the villain out on how many people they've denied mercy before sparing them anyway. Others may deliver a "reason you suck" speech and leave the villain alive just to spite him. or they might just shoot him.

If the hero does grant him mercy, its very common for the villain to attempt to attack the hero one last time, usually while his back is turned. this will rarely work.

In popular works, such as James Bond and such, where killing the villain is considered standard operating policy, you will rarely, if ever, actually see someone begging for mercy and then be killed by the hero as the resulting mood whiplash would be too great and might result in the audience turning against the hero. Of course, there are always darker and edgier exceptions, such as with 24 and its licenced-to-kill lead character Jack Bauer.

Compare i surrender, suckers if the villain uses the surrender to trick the hero. When the hero does this, it's ain't too proud to beg.
