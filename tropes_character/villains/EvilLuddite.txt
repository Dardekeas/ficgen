science is bad? new technology is evil? ludd was right? Well, probably not. But don't tell that to these guys. They're utterly convinced that technology is evil...and so is anyone who uses it. They burn down factories, engage in fantastic racism against robots, cyborgs and transhumans, call for the execution of people who have had life-saving surgery and lay siege to laboratories. If their motive or justification is religious, they will often overlap with the fundamentalist. If their motive is environmentalism, then they're almost certainly part of an animal wrongs group. Sometimes they don't really believe in what they're preaching and just want all that shiny, shiny tech for themselves.

Characters like this are generally villains in science fiction. In stories with a nature hero, they might exist (as the big bad or a second villainous faction) to provide a foil. A story where ludd was right might have this accidentally if the protagonist is too much of a designated hero. Contrast with the generally peaceful space amish. See also evil reactionary, who opposes modern changes to society, rather than to technology (naturally, the two may overlap).
