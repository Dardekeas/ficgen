This is differentiated from the villain song in that it is not sung by the villain, but about the villain. The Villain Sucks Song basically just describes how the villain is a horrible person in every way, hopefully with lots of witty jabs. This song is sometimes interrupted because the villain is right behind me.

Sometimes also becomes a insult backfire, because some villains actually find it flattering. Normally the villain is a card-carrying villain.

Note the character this song is aimed at doesn't have to be the villain. It can also be sung about a main character who starts off bad, but who is destined to undergo a heel-face turn. Not to be confused with the villain sucking at being a villain, though that might also be the case.

In period pieces, this can overlap with hail to the thief. If it's sung to the villain, it could count as "the reason you suck" speech. For the heroic version, see the hero sucks song.
