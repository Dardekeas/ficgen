The heroes have defeated the big bad, and as they step out of the ashes and rubble, they congratulate themselves on a job well done. Now that the day is saved, they can relax and have a nice evening at home, knowing that the world is once again a safer place.

But wait! the dragon rises from the rubble, filled with determination and a thirst for vengeance. Maybe he was loyal to his former master, or now he's free to fulfill his own ambitions without a pesky overlord in the way. He might even turn out to be worse than his predecessor.

This is often a sequel hook.

Compare and contrast dragon their feet, dragon with an agenda, the starscream, and bastard understudy. take up my sword is the heroic equivalent. Sometimes overlaps with as long as there is evil. While they are very similar, there's a crucial difference between this trope and being The Starscream: the Dragon was not directly involved with the Big Bad's downfall. There is a grey area with this, as sometimes the Dragon "drags his feet" or has his own agenda, but so long as he displays at least nominal allegiance to the core leadership, he's not the Starscream. The opposite of this trope is demoted to dragon, where a character who was previously big bad in their own right becomes the dragon to a new big bad.
