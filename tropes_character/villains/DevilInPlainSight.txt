Someone who is so obviously up to no good that the one character who seems aware of it is shocked no one else seems to notice. Everyone else, especially those with a tendency to be horrible judges of character, may just consider them a little quirky and wonder what the observant character's problem is.

Sometimes this can be a villain hiding as a lesser immoral person. For example, no one would be the least bit surprised to find out that any given politician is a slimy scheming jerkass, and thus they manage to hide their greater villainy as the simple pettiness of your every day scumbag.

Less extreme than the villain with good publicity, who is thought of highly by most people; the Devil In Plain Sight is mostly met with inattentive indifference. May also be a bitch in sheep's clothing. Might also be a case of notice this (for the audience only).

too dumb to fool can be their most dangerous enemies.

Compare with it was here, i swear, not-so-imaginary friend, mama didn't raise no criminal, mistaken for an imposter. Contrast they look just like everyone else and most definitely not a villain. For when the Devil In Plain Sight is actually the big D-man himself, see louis cypher. Often crosses over with obviously evil.

See hidden in plain sight for when a macguffin does this.
