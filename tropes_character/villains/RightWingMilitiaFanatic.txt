These people are members of an underground militia which holds suspicion that the government is going to declare martial law, seize everybody's guns, and perhaps cede national sovereignty to the united nations to form a one world order, or implant everyone with microchips to make it easier to track them, and start sending patriots like them to prison camps any day now â€” but not on their watch! Particularly unsympathetic examples will have them displaying white supremacist or neo-nazi sympathies. The methods employed by the more fanatical of them may even include brazen violence and terrorism toward the government.

While the militia movement has antecedents going back decades (many militias themselves claim the "Minutemen" of the american revolution as spiritual predecessors), most of these characters appeared during the nineties in American media, particularly after the Ruby Ridge incident, the Waco Siege and the Oklahoma City bombing, which involved government confrontations with supposed real life versions of these characters. The truth about them is a bit more complicated; see the analysis page for more.

Compare and contrast red scare, the revolution will not be civilized, yellow peril and malcolm xerox. A common source of western terrorists. Often a crazy survivalist. For the left-wing version, try dirty communists or bomb-throwing anarchists.
