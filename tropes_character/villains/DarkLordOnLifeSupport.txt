An event has left a villain severely injured or drained of power. It doesn't have to be a machine; it can be the inability to survive without attaching to another body.

This can be a way of creating sympathy for the villain by showing that he is weak or dependent. The weakness can be exploited by someone attacking him â€” the evil overlord may not have full strength because of what's happened to him, or may be stuck in one place. Dependance means that the hero can destroy the support system to destroy his enemy. Frequently, the very thing that made the dark lord this way was done by the hero, sometimes in a battle that didn't succeed in completely killing the villain. This can be a sign that the hero wasn't ready to fight the villain, that he did so rashly, etc..

This may result in a dragon-in-chief. May or may not be an evil cripple. See also man in the machine, brain in a jar and no immortal inertia. May also be a trait of a villainous symbiote.
