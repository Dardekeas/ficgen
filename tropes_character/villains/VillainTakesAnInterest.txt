So you have a pair of arch enemies: a hero and a villain. And then... the villain gets interested in the hero.

The hero and villain are very similar to each other, and both grow aware of that fact. But they have different reactions. While the villain genuinely wants to take the hero under his or her wing, the hero is opposed to any friendly interaction—but may fear the villain has a point. The kind of obsessive behavior and mind games this generates on both ends is a prime source of foe yay.

If the hero and the enemy do end up becoming mentor and student, the ensuing relationship can range from the worst kind of training from hell to a downright parental role. Both will still probably end up at odds. And it'll end badly for at least one of them.

the hero will usually consider the mentor to be their arch-enemy and be very personally devoted to taking them down; the mentor character is typically more amused by this than anything, and may take the role of a stealth evil mentor. foe yay may lead to a mind game ship, a mentor ship, or both.

Related to we can rule together, but rather than offering a position, offers a study period. Note that this requires a mentoring role—worthy opponent offering a team-up doesn't cut it.
