Whether you consider it short for villain credentials or villain credibility, it's a measure both of how much respect a villain gets among his fellow rogues and of how credible a threat the do-gooders and the authorities consider said villain to be. It's earned through successful completion of bold, daring and devious deeds; in other words, nothing so pedestrian as robbing bank or holding up a liquor store will suffice. It can also be lost in a heartbeat if one runs afoul of meddling kids and their talking dog.

A specific villainous version of a karma meter. Often a major motivation factor for a card-carrying villain or noble demon.

A supertrope to arson, murder, and admiration, a more comedic take on the concept. Contrast unintentionally notorious crime, where a villain gets too much cred.
