if our protagonists are visiting commie land or a banana republic, they will never run into the secret police.

Why would they? You only need a police force if there is crime, and the country the heroes are in either has the lowest crime rate in the world or absolutely no crime at all. Any troublemaker just tends to "disappear" overnight; people who see their neighbors being taken away know it's best to look away and not guess why. As there are no criminals, there's no need for any kind of law court, judicial system, anti-torture laws or state prison either.Common in dystopian fiction. If the secret police existed and had their own military force, then it would be a state sec.

If the culture isn't so bad, or the police—while secret, or at least very quiet—aren't altogether evil or brutal, they may just be the men in black.
