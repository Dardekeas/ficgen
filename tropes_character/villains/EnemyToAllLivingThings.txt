This is the pure is not good version of the friend to all living things. While a Friend To All Living Things causes animals to flock to him/her because of their sweetness and innocence, the evil energies of an Enemy To All Living Things causes animals to flee from them or, if he/she's powerful enough, die. In that case, their energies can also cause plants to rot and decay.If the character causes living things to die, the heroes are sometimes (but not always) exempted from this. Expect them to suffer as if under a slow acting poison, mana drain, or to have their stats lowered.

Constrast fisher king, where they have to rule first, but cause destruction on a much vaster scale. See also animals hate him for when the creatures don't run away.

Compare with omnicidal maniac and, to a certain degree, eldritch abomination. See walking wasteland for a more powerful form of this. See poisonous person for a toxic touch variant. This is also why the evil-detecting dog is man's best friend. If others are drawn to killing the person rather than running away or dying, it's everything trying to kill you.
