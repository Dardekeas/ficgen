This trope applies whenever a villainous character has romantic and/or sexual feelings for a heroic one.

If this crush takes a turn for the perverse, this can lead to tropes like i have you now, my pretty, forceful kiss, bathe her and bring her to me, and now you must marry me, scarpia ultimatum, and go-go enslavement, although none of those require a Villainous Crush. Additionally, the villain may become a stalker with a crush. If the crush itself is a motivating factor in their start of darkness, then it's love makes you evil.

Conversely, this trope can be played as a humanizing factor, making the character into more of an anti-villain, and the love interest may act as a morality pet. Taken all the way, it may become love redeems.

If the feelings are mutual or an actual relationship develops, then it's dating catwoman instead. When this is purely subtextual, see foe romance subtext. The specific variant when the Evil Empress captures the hero to seduce him is villainesses want heroes.
