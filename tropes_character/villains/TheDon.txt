This is the patriarch of a crime family â€” most often, as captain obvious would suggest, the mafia. He is shrewd, ruthless, and better not be crossed. Often he will hold to an arcane code of honor, which is perhaps incomprehensible to non-mobsters. He will be very protective of his family and he will ensure that his dear little girl wants for nothing, all while maintaining the illusion of morality. Unlike other villains this type is often fairly genre savvy. Quite likely he did read the evil overlord list. Also more likely than many villain archetypes to be an anti-villain, whose sole interest is in keeping the peace in his town and the money flowing.

The Oyabun is his yakuza counterpart.
