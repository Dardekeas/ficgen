So there is some cosmic being locked away so that it cannot interfere with the outside world. Some sort of powerful being... good, evil, or neither, it doesn't matter. But this time, they didn't lock away the being in a magical jar of some sort. Rather, they somehow managed to bind the thing into the body of a person. A person who may, or may not be aware that they are carrying around some dangerous being within them.

Unleashing the cosmic being usually results in the "can" either dying or being subsumed into it, or killing the "can" results in the destruction of the being. Occasionally causes a battle in the center of the mind. Occasionally results in a superpowered evil side, for the evil, neutral and knight templar examples. reincarnation may be involved.

A Subtrope of sealed evil in a can, sealed good in a can, and sealed badass in a can. Contrast grand theft me. Compare macguffin girl and treasure chest cavity. See also restraining bolt. Evil beings sealed this way are almost always a leaking can of evil.
