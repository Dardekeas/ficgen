The villains of any sports series or movie. Mostly made up of designated villains and villainy free villains, the Opposing Sports Team is the number one team before the main hero's eventual victory. They got to this point not because of team spirit, but because of either cheating or a grueling, soulless regimen that goes against whatever the aesop of the show is. They almost always wear a uniform that is mostly black. These may be to sports what the "stop having fun" guys are to video games; the types who play the game solely to win, and will resort to any means to do so.

Also seen in commercials as the side that doesn't endorse the main product, whom the hero defeats through cereal induced superpowers.

In 1980s and 1990s vintage sports movies, this team is the posse of bullying, snobbish, white private school rich kids, while the hero's team comprises ethnically diverse middle- to lower-class public schoolers. Watch for a dirty scheme to close the neighborhood rec center, and lots of northeastern-accented trash-talk.

If the competition is international, expect the Opposing Sports Team to be either soviet (Red Commies trained from birth in athlete factories and pumped on steroids) or german (hyper-efficient, arrogant, and we'll never forgive them for the war). For bonus points, they could be East German, combining both. Nowadays the reputation of the from birth athlete factory has largely shifted towards the Chinese, as Russia radically downscaled old soviet youth sports programs, while China took this tactic and ran with it.
