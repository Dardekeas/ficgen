If your story is set in the medieval or early modern period, and if its geographical scope is closer to a town or county than a kingdom or empire, then the villain of choice for you is the feudal overlord. This sinister noble rules over villagers and peasants with an iron fist, being surrounded by a guard of armed mooks that enforce his oppressive taxes and get hold of beautiful maidens that have caught the lord's eye. He may have to answer for his acts to a higher authority such as a King, but either the king will also be evil, or he will be distant and unaware of the sufferings of the commoners. Therefore the feudal overlord will have effectively unchecked authority over the region, and will of course use it for his benefit and pleasure.

At least, unless he goes too far, and la r√©sistance takes arms...

Historical examples of this trope are a main reason why aristocrats are evil. See also corrupt hick, which is a modern deep south equivalent. Can also feature in the feudal future, if travel is limited.
