This trope is when even though the villain of a work is no longer around, the plot continues to be driven by things they did while alive. This can be done by his organization being taken over by someone else, his descendants being evil themselves, someone continues his plans without him, and so forth. If it's an ongoing series where one way or another every villain can be traced back to the first one despite his defeat, it's this trope.

This trope is not, however, when the original villain is still manipulating things behind the scenes. For a true Villainous Legacy, they must have actually been defeated and are no longer the main threat. If the villain somehow continues to directly act against the heroes in some manner, it is not this trope. This trope can still apply if the villain is still around, as long as they are no longer the primary antagonist of the current story.

Compare predecessor villain, bigger bad, hijacked by ganon, as long as there is evil, and my death is just the beginning, each of which can overlap with this trope. Contrast eternal hero, which is the heroic version. See also the man behind the man, the man behind the monsters, someone to remember him by, leaking can of evil, the remnant, avenging the villain, which can be assorted ways this trope is invoked.

NOTE: Because this trope focuses on a villain being behind other events in a series (and often dead themselves), expect unmarked spoilers.
