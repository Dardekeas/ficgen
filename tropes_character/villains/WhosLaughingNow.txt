So you have a character who is the butt of every joke. They are regularly put through hell, purely for the audience's amusement. And they have had enough.

What did the heroes do wrong? Maybe the harmless mook wasn't so harmless after all. Maybe that last jibe went too far. Whatever the reason, this character is through with being the comedy sidekick and determined to show the heroes precisely why you should beware the nice ones.

And what better way to go about it than to become a villain?

Who's laughing now, hero? Who's laughing NOW?!

This can occur with victims of a world full of jerk jocks, where the kids are cruel and teens are monsters. By this point, they don't realize the irony: that by taking revenge, they have become as bad as those who victimized them. This could also result in the butt monkey being pushed back down into the former position, or the character could become relatively harmless but still extremely annoying. May result in the character becoming arch enemies with the most abusive.

A deconstruction of tropes such as butt monkey and the chew toy, a specific variant of face-heel turn and he who fights monsters, and a form of freudian excuse. Compare start of darkness, beware the nice ones, break the cutie, woobie, destroyer of worlds, kick the dog, not-so-harmless villain, and then let me be evil.

Not to be confused with Who's Crying Now.
