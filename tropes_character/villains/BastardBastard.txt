He's the son of the ruler of the land. Therefore, he's the Prince, next in the line of succession, and a privileged member of his society, yes?

No. royal blood aside, he's a nobody. he's a literal bastard, and the reason for the negative connotation of the word.

Born with the shame of unmarried parents, he is marginalized at best, reviled and banished at worst (not to mention unable to inherit), but unlike his more sympathetic counterpart, the heroic bastard, the bastard bastard is not trying to rise above society's expectations. Instead, his parental abandonment has created the ultimate freudian excuse. He's the jerkass woobie who's got it in for his father, his siblings, or maybe even the world. His issues have driven him to seek revenge, or made him vulnerable to manipulation by the forces of Evil. Generally male, although female examples are becoming more common.

This trope can be found in any society where rank or wealth can be inherited, if it also has a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate offspringÂ—making it older than dirt.

While not exactly a discredited trope, the subversion is more common today. Modern audiences have a less stringent view toward children and wedlock and tend to be more accepting of a literal bastard character. While modern settings don't really make use of this trope as plenty of modern fiction deals with settings that draw inspiration from the middle ages (particularly high fantasy but plenty of other genres too) it'll continue to be relevant for as long as people want to write about aristocracies and so forth.

Stands a good chance of being a manipulative bastard. While it's possible, he is unlikely to be a magnificent bastard. There's nothing magnificent about this quivering pile of daddy-issues. Don't you dare compare him to his legitimate brother the evil prince. A subtrope of the resenter.
