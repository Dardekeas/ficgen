Lawyers other than the main characters are typically opportunistic, unlikeable, arrogant, cynical, slimy characters, especially the corporate ones. Lawyers come in various degrees of oiliness, but the worst defense attorneys will actually seem to know their client is guilty and act as though they just love seeing guilty people go free, and the worst prosecutors will ruthlessly hound defendants even when they personally acquire knowledge of their complete innocence. If the main character is poor and/or not that intelligent, the Amoral Attorney is the Goliath in the david v. goliath scenario.

In reality, attorneys are simply acting and arguing on behalf of their clients, and are supposed to be amoral (not immoral!) in their advocacy. An attorney is a true punch clock villain or punch clock hero depending on who hires them. In fact, in some jurisdictions, like the uk, advocates have no choice who they defend, socially: if approached, it's considered extremely unprofessional to not work for that client—what barristers call the "taxi rank" system. Criminal defense attorneys, in particular, are often very kind-hearted, civic-minded people who genuinely believe that even the worst members of society deserve a fair shake—even if they understand perfectly well that their client is almost certainly guilty. Ideally, a strong defense of their client serves as an important check against false accusations, corrupt cops, hanging judges, kangaroo courts, and other forms of fast-but-unfair tyranny. Thus the defense attorney's arguments slow down the legal procedure for the sake of long-term accuracy. What an attorney should not be is unethical. In trope terms, a good lawyer is (ideally) lawful neutral in practice and (dare we say it) lawful good in intention. In the wonderful world of fiction, however, cheat-to-win is the name of the game. After all, it's not much of a "drama" if the opponent isn't villainous and unlikable, is it?

Another thing that people often forget is that for all the attention crimes get, they are actually a minority of the cases that appear before the courts. The vast majority of cases are civil cases, where in most instances everyone has something a bit off about them. This is particularly true in business-related cases, but except in family court (where very often someone is beating someone in their household up), either side could be seen as slimy or at least culpable in most suits.

If desired, they can be made more sympathetic for audiences by having them do their jobs through gritted teeth for their loathsome clients as they quietly and firmly tell them to sit down and behave themselves. Furthermore, if they win, the lawyers in question can treat their clients coldly afterward by refusing to accept their thanks and responding that they will send them their very expensive bill for services rendered, since they were only in it for the money. A reasonably friendly social meeting between the prosecuting and defending lawyers after work can show that there are no hard feelings for each other doing their jobs as officers of the court.

This trope is also usually averted if the lawyer in question is working for a cause such as environmentalism, legal aid, civil rights, or against corruption, which are often portrayed heroically. Often if the main character is a lawyer, they will be forced to choose between a high paying but amoral position with a business law firm, or a low paying job for an environmental or civil rights organization.

It is worth pointing out that an Amoral Attorney is competent. They do not bring silly frivolous lawsuits - that's the ambulance chaser. Although often unethical, this villain isn't necessarily corrupt. Being rules lawyers, they don't necessarily break the law to win, they merely work around and within the law's limitations with the assumption that their opposition will be doing the same thing in their own favor (or at least that the opposition would be stupid not to and thus would deserve a sound thrashing).

No real life examples please. We don't want to get sued.
