In real life, Pyromania is a mental disorder that compels a person to set fires, and causes the sufferer to feel enjoyment and stress release (and in some cases even sexual release) from firestarting and watching fires. In addition to being a very rare disorder it also has the standard mental disorder caveat of no two cases being identical and usually coming bundled with other issues and a difficult childhood.

While real-life pyromaniacs tend to be somewhat mentally unstable, fictional characters with this disorder tend to exhibit it to the level of evil murderous ax-crazy who really only get their kicks from death and murder with fire. Pyromaniac characters enjoy lighting fires, watching fires, playing with fires, killing with fires, and generally make and use fire whenever they're able to; whether they have inherent fire powers, or merely use flamethrowers or other incendiary weapons, you really don't want to get in their sights.

Note that using or favoring kill it with fire does not automatically make a character a pyromaniac: Having a mental disorder that makes the character feel enjoyment in the act of starting fires is what makes one a pyromaniac.

Compare psycho electro for electricity-based powers, and mad bomber for a common, terrifying overlap. For a more light-hearted take on mental illness-induced criminality, see the kleptomaniac.
