The shining gem of the non-serial movie, an antagonist who is inevitably related (especially romantically) in some way to one of the characters. The trouble occurs when they revisit, and the current situation (say, a character's new love interest) is one that doesn't suit them at all. For maximum effect, the reveal pulled off near the very end gives a little twist to the "villain" as well as some surprising insight to a relevant character. These work well for such a movie because it is much easier to add backstory without affecting things later, and is often never mentioned again in the television series proper.
