Most people take an understandably dim view of abandoning a military post. Even works that disapprove of warfare on general principles usually won't approve, especially if it took place "in the heat" of battle, (thus leaving more loyal soldiers hanging). So those who say screw this, i'm outta here! to a legitimate group tend to be bad people.

The problem is often not just their dishonorable abandonment. The real problem is their now-desperate situation. Desertion is usually punishable by death, so these people have no more incentive to refrain from other capital offenses, like murder, and every reason to engage in them if they think you'll turn them in. They tend to steal what they need from the surrounding countryside. And they can't just settle down, lest they be caught. They may try to pass themselves off as war refugees.

There are a few sympathetic deserters out there, usually having left a villain's army which they had no choice about joining, but they are not this trope. The Dangerous Deserter is hardened, desperate, and, well, dangerous.

Contrast rebellious rebel.
