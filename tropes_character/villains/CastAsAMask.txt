When an actor is too famous, looks too distinct or sounds too distinct to disguise their identity from the audience, cast someone to be the mask; in other words, bring on a different actor to play the character whenever they are wearing their disguise.

This way (one can only hope) the audience won't guess the secret, at least not until you want them to.

Although this is often done for villains, it is not limited to them.
