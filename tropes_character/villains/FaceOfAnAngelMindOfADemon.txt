Most of the time, evil characters will have a stereotypical "evil" look to them. Not these guys. These villains have the looks that are generally associated with absolute innocence. Of course, don't be surprised if they use that to their advantage.

Not to be confused with beauty is bad or evil is sexy, as looking attractive and looking innocent/virtuous are not necessarily associated with each other. (If anything, they are sometimes contrasted.)

Also not to be confused with the killer rabbit, who looks weaker than they are, but not necessarily more innocent. (And definitely not to be confused with bitch in sheep's clothing, since they're not necessarily jerkasses.) Parent trope to enfant terrible if applied to children.

Compare divinely appearing demons. Contrast with face of a thug. Very frequently overlaps with light is not good, since light and innocence are almost synonymous in aesthetics.
