So, you've got the atoner, he has done some bad things and regrets them. He works hard to be redeemed and you think he's going to get support, right?

Wrong. There is a character, a very vindictive person who wants nothing better than to force the Atoner to wallow in his guilt.

Perhaps the atoner was once the dragon, and his master wants him to feel that redemption is virtually impossible, perhaps it was someone who was hurt by the atoner and doesn't want them to be redeemed, because they did something they find unforgivable. The former often overlaps with evil cannot comprehend good and the latter case usually overlaps with he who fights monsters.

Compare to never accepted in his home town, inspector javert, and he who fights monsters. Contrast with karma houdini.
