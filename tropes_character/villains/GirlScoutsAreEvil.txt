Is there anything more adorable and innocent than a Girl Scout? Definitely yes, if you ask some people (especially in the webcomic community). For some reason, they often end up depicted as vile monsters who use deceptive cuteness and innocence to guilt-trip adults into buying a product they neither want nor need (viz., Girl Scout cookies) at greatly inflated prices. And if that doesn't work, they've got other weapons they can resort to...

Evil Girl Scouts are a type of killer rabbit. They may not actually be called girl scouts. Expect them to kick shins. Sibling trope to milkman conspiracy.
