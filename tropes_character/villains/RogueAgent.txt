A member of a government intelligence agency or military unit who starts operating on his own authority. Often this is merely a cover for activities the government in question would denounce if anything went wrong. If more than one person is involved, it will be described as a "renegade operation" or "rogue elephant".

For writers this is a good way to have a villain with all the skills and knowledge of the heroes, should they also be spooks or special forces soldiers. Also useful if you're backed by the pentagon, as you're not disparaging the organization as a whole, just a "bad apple". Likewise, Irish terrorists are often described as being from rogue factions to avoid having to deal with the irish question.

For the group version of this, see renegade splinter faction. Also renegade russian and terrorists without a cause for specific examples of this trope.
