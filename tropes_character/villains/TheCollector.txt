One of the characters runs afoul of the collector of the strange, who decides to add them to his collection. Usually this is seen in speculative fiction: the collector is an alien, often of the sufficiently advanced variety, and the collection is only revealed at the end in a twist ending. But he could just as easily be a slaver or an obsessed lunatic in a present or past setting. He's prone to saying "it must be mine" and "if i can't have you, no one can!"

Where the horror of being added to a collection is not the point of a twist ending, then the remaining cast members mobilize to rescue the kidnapped individual â€” and usually free all the other "specimens" in the collection in the process.

A variation sometimes seen in children's shows has the collector stealing the character's unusual/unique pet. Vulnerable to interrogation by vandalism. If they have somewhat altruistic motives, their "collection" will be a comfortable fantastic nature reserve. Of course, it may just be a gilded cage... Compare living doll collector.

Not to be confused with the bizarre as hell gorn movie released in 2009, or the 2004-2006 canadian tv series, or the 1963 stalker with a crush novel by John Fowles or the film based on it starring Terence Stamp.
