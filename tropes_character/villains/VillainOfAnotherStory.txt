The villainous version of hero of another story, Villain Of Another Story is when a villain is not a villain in the main narrative but is a villain elsewhere in the setting. That means a character that is not treated as a villain in the story can be legitimately considered a villain by other characters. The Villain Of Another Story may have little to no impact on the main plot.

This trope is common in role-playing games, where sometimes an NPC might be a villain depending on what actions you take in the story. Sometimes, you can avoid fighting the villain, but he/she will be evil in other places in the setting.

A subversion would be that the supposed Villain of Another Story eventually gets dragged into the main story and dealt with by the heroes, as then they become a villain of the main story.

Compare bigger bad, an evil, antagonistic force different than a villain or a big bad in the sense that it never confronts the hero directly, but still causes most of the trouble in the setting's world (possibly including being responsible for the Big Bad's existence). Also compare lone wolf boss, where a boss in the game isn't in league with the Big Bad and may or may not be a Villain of Another Story. When a villain has no impact on the story except in filler, it's a filler villain. If "elsewhere in the setting" is the setting's past (i.e., a flashback or an older story), it's a predecessor villain. When the villain of the main story also commits villainous acts that are not part of the narrative, it's offscreen villainy.
