When a malicious group is investigated and busted, a member brags how the group is everywhere. The group member will further claim that their movement is growing, and will rule supreme someday, leaving the heroes concerned that there will be more trouble in the future.

The most common associations are with right-wing militia movements, which became a trope of their own following the militia scare in the media after the Oklahoma City bombing.

Note also that the same claim may be made by the heroes when they are the resistance to a despotic regime. Naturally, the message is inverted this way.

Contrast red scare and yellow peril. the syndicate is very fond of this line, as is the conspiracy. People involved with the masquerade generally don't brag about it, but might make an exception if they're dying anyway.
