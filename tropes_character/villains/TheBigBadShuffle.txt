The audience is presented with a number candidates for the big bad, the true source of evil actions.

The writers are playing the Big Bad Shuffle when Bob, the good guy, defeats Big Bad candidate Mr. Corrupton, but learns that Mr. Corrupton was really just being manipulated by Big Bad candidate Dr. Unethik. So Bob, the good guy,  kills Unethik, but finds out that Unethik was secretly controlled by the Big Bad candidate omniscient council of vagueness, which turns out to have Bob's scheming trophy wife as a member and who is now — you guessed it — a Big Bad candidate. And so on, with a few station breaks to sell you some of the aspirin you now need.

Tropes by which this can be invoked include the man behind the man, hidden villain, the dog was the mastermind and hijacked by ganon.

Multiple reveals and unreveals are mandatory. Contrast big bad ensemble, which is when there are several Big Bads operating at once.
