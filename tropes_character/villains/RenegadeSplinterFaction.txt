Basically, a group who separates from a larger organization - holding the main beliefs or goals of the original, but are wholly or mostly evil.

Two common ways of applying this trope:

 The writer doesn't want to paint some organization, nation or religion black. It may be a real-world institution, or an institution from this fictional world which was previously described as at least semi-decent. But the author still wants villains belonging to it, so they invent a renegade group.

 A faction that operates without authorization, and their methodology differs from the main body. Often they are extremists: escalating a conflict, willing to break the rules, far more infamous than their mother alignment - but this isn't always the case.

Note that it doesn't apply to out and out turncoats: the faction must still keep the general ideas of the original; only with less benevolent policies. If the factions are religious in nature, related to the heretic. Can result in enemy civil war. renegade russian is a common nation-specific subtrope, since Russians and Soviets get this treatment especially often. If the original organization was bad-ish, but not bad enough, this may result in the good, the bad, and the evil. This may be used to provide an inversion of my species doth protest too much by setting up an antagonist, then revealing that the rest of their faction doesn't like them either.

For the individual version, see rogue agent.
