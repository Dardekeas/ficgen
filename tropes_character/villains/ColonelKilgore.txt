In most if not all war movies, there's an officer who seems to actually enjoy the war. He runs into battle with a smile on his face and seems sad that the war has to end someday.

named after colonel kilgore in Apocalypse Now, though you'd be forgiven for thinking it's a pun on "kill-gore" we made.

This trope is the intersection of blood knight with colonel badass. Not necessarily the neidermeyer (who wants to get something out of the war), and usually not a general ripper (who's paranoid and crazy), nor a sociopathic soldier. Not necessarily mean to the troops or totally obsessed, just someone who enjoys the war a bit too much. Any commanding officer from a proud warrior race will automatically be this trope; just expect the words "honor in battle" to be thrown around a lot more. See also it amused me and blood knight.
