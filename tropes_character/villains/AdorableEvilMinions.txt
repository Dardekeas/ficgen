The big bad has arrived, and he has with him, his teeming army of...tiny cuddly wuddly mooks who nonetheless do his bidding.

Instead of using elite mooks or eldritch abominations, the big bad instead employs an army of adorable, mostly-harmless creatures who are only a threat via full on zerg rush, which is OK, since he does have a rather large army of them.

A hand wave is usually given, such as these adorable minions are simply practical due to being easy to produce (if they are artificial beings), work for practically nothing, or are enslaved.

Expect them to be fairly incompetent, and hilarity ensues whenever they are left on their own. Despite knowing they're hardly dependable, expect their employer to moan at least once about how he's "surrounded by idiots". When they do prove to be quite dangerous after a fashion, this trope shifts to killer rabbit.

Frequently overlaps with mascot mook.
