A big bad is a common driving force behind conflict in stories, so it makes natural sense to write one in. But villainy requires villainous acts... so a villain who doesn't really perform those is a bit hard to swallow.

If one is written in anyway, the result is a character who is treated as a bad guy by the plot, despite never actually doing anything as to justify the amount of hate that they receive from the good guys. any astute arguments and observations by this character are to be dismissed by the audience, because they are obviously evilÂ™, just as the designated hero is regarded as 'good' despite having no significant virtues.

In fact, this may only prove a character a jerkass, especially in regards to the protagonist. This isn't a case of a deliberately over-the-top villain, it's a personification of being an ass for its own sake. That being said, there are cases where just being a jerk can qualify one for being the antagonist by itself.

Alternately, it might be a character that could fall under hero antagonist. Keep in mind that antagonists and villains are very different things.

If a work is too anvilicious with this, than the audience might start rooting for the empire out of spite.

Compare and contrast designated hero, poke the poodle, villain ball magnet, hate sink, and villainy-free villain. Also see felony misdemeanor. Not to be confused with designated evil.

Not to be confused with offstage villainy, which is where the bad guy did bad things... but not on screen.

Please note that tropes are not bad, as this can sometimes be done on purpose to add more shades of grey to a story, or to show that the heroes are not completely perfect.
