The inverse of he who must not be seen. In fact, this villain's appearance may be the only thing about them that is seen. Their agenda, their goal, their target, their motives â€” all secret. We're shown their face, we know their name, we see what they do and how they operate, but we're never told why. They're after the macguffin, but what're they planning to use it for? They consistently send mons and mooks out to kill the hero, but why? It's rarely ever as simple as taking over the world (rarely, but one shouldn't say never).

Note that this does not apply to the occasional episode-long secret plan. True Hidden Agenda Villains have a hidden agenda for an entire series or arc. If they ever "discuss" it with minions or partners, expect the omniscient council of vagueness.

Don't bother trying to decipher their hidden agenda; sometimes even the writers don't know. They're playing it safe until they come up with something good without having to retcon. If and when an explanation is revealed, it may involve a luke, i am your father. Note, no matter what happens, it's probably exactly as planned.

A poorly written example of this trope can easily become a generic doomsday villain if the characterization behind the hidden agenda isn't believable.

Compare with the enigmatic minion, which is a just as mysterious underling or lesser villain working for - or possibly against - a more comprehensible big bad. Or perhaps not. If the agenda is so hidden that the other characters don't even know there is a villain, or if they do have no idea who it is, see hidden villain. See also outside-context villain, whose hidden agenda is only part of the menace. Compare motive misidentification. Contrast with ambiguously evil.
