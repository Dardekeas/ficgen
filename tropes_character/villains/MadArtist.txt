The right-brain equivalent to the mad scientist and mad doctor. May work in any medium, but the subject is almost always evil. He may make statues by dipping live people in concrete/wax, he may redecorate other people's houses with explosives, or he may try to get the perfect ending to his murder mystery novel by starting a real murder mystery. The unifying thread is that he always sees a few incidental deaths as meaningless compared to the eternal majesty of his masterpieces.

Mad performance artists, singers, actors, and the like do outrageous and sociopathic things in public either as art, or so that people will pay attention to their art.

This character's motivation and descent into madness may be similar to his scientist counterpart, caused by a shunning from the community or a dismissal of his work as too crazy or unorthodox.

The Mad Artist is somewhat rarer a trope than the Mad Scientist since, while science is bad, art is almost always good, or at least benign (even if it is angsty or incomprehensible). Some characters actually embody both tropes at once, using super science to fuel their mad artistic vision. While a mad scientist can be one of the good guys, you'll practically never see a Mad Artist so venerated — to escalate into Mad Artistry, the artist must usually break too sacred a taboo (eg. murder or torture) to be an acceptable good guy.

There is an element of truth in television with this trope. The list of creative people who have exhibited symptoms of mental illness is inexhaustible. However, most Real Life Mad Artists aren't violent  they're much more prone to Angst.

For actual artists who draw for MAD (who may or may not qualify as this, depending on the point of view) see that Trope Page.
