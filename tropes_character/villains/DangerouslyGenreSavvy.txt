Some villains don't play by the rules. A point comes when a typical genre blind villain would make the tiny, critical but common mistake that would lead to their defeat like every other villain before them in an identical situation.

But this time, the villain has an attack of real life common sense and uses their genre savviness to their advantage. No need to waste your breath asking why don't you just shoot him? â€” they do!

In brief, a villain that's read (or even written) a rule or two on the evil overlord list, and will usually bring attention to this very fact. Though they don't always overlap, being Dangerously Genre Savvy does help on the road to being a magnificent bastard and/or no-nonsense nemesis. Bonus points if the action is only superior if one assumes that the world runs on narrative logic rather than reality.

This trope can also apply to darker and edgier heroes who use their Genre Savviness to bump off villains.

A subversion of the villain ball. The opposite of contractual genre blindness. Compare flaw exploitation, and fake weakness. May lead to defied trope and (from there?) reality ensues.
