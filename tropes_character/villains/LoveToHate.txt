"Love to hate" is a term we (and others) use to describe villains we enjoy. We love them for various reasons, such as excellent character development, being hilarious, getting the best writing, having a memorable personality, or being lucky enough to have a top notch performance by their actor. But at the same time the fans still want to see the baddie get their comeuppance in the end. There is still hatred, after all. Also named Heel Hate.

faux affably evil, affably evil, laughably evil, magnificent bastard, and card-carrying villain are sub tropes for different reasons. Being a large ham definitely helps (see also evil is hammy). An anti-villain is often one of these due to the character development they often get. A villain who's the scrappy, or creator's pet is typically not eligible for this trope as are some villains who cross the moral event horizon.

Not to be confused with draco in leather pants, which is when a villain's fandom will gloss over the actual nastiness of a villain and insist that he or she is just misunderstood. Also not to be confused with when the heroes would love to hate the villain, but just can't manage it.

This is someone whom the fans enjoy and even maybe respect because of their unapologetic evilness. Their shamelessness is cathartic to us, and they retain their awesomeness as time goes by without villain decay.

In order to be eligible, a villain must be generally well regarded/well liked by said fandom while the same fandom still acknowledges they're a villain. Being here means that said villain is part of the pantheon of great villains.
