They come sweeping down from the mountains like an avalanche, or surging from the deep forest like a tide of vermin. They come from across the sea in their dragon-prowed ships, or storming from the forsaken wastes that no other men can dwell in. They come to rape, pillage, and burn, howling like death itself, and leave only destruction and despair in their wake. They waylay travelers, ransack peasant villages, and even lay siege to the bastions of civilization. They take only what plunder and slaves they can carry, and torch and butcher the rest.

The third standard fantasy government alongside the empire and the kingdom, the horde is a large group of barbaric or beastly warriors bound solely through either tribal ties (if disorganized) or the will of the evil overlord (if organized). Like the proud warrior race guy, they value strength above all else, but are usually not as honorable. Their leader is usually the strongest, toughest, and/or most vicious or cunning of the group, often because the fastest way to advance through the ranks is via klingon promotion.

Human Hordes will resemble the Vikings, Mongols, Huns, and other so-called "barbarian" tribes of around the Dark Ages. The Horde is also the most common depiction of orcs, regardless of any other differences. Any "sub-human" or monstrous race will do, though, be they goblins, lizard folk, or beastmen - a coalition is even possible since evil is an equal opportunity employer. In some settings the legions of hell or the undead may serve as The Horde. In a pinch you could even have large bandit gangs filling this role.

A popular convention is for the horde to originate from the east, with the west portrayed as the civilized society that is being overrun.

Often part of the fantasy axis of evil. Compare the usual adversaries and the horde of alien locusts.
