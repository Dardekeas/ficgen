What might be considered the inverse of offing the offspring, and is equally aberrant behavior is when a villain murders their own parents. Any character behaving this way will probably be ax-crazy and/or a psycho for hire. An evil prince can also do that if he's impatient enough. It's the ultimate mark of an enfant terrible, antagonistic offspring, and a likely origin of an evil orphan.

It can be justified if the parents happen to be abusive or cruel mockeries of humanity from beyond the void â€” insofar as murder can be, but at least it's then the domain of the dark and troubled protagonists. It's more justifiable if the parent is an outright villain. In addition, there are also instances where the child either unintentionally killed his parents or something genuinely horrific happened to his/her parents that they are forced to kill them. It can also be justifiable if said parent was going to be offing the offspring anyway, and needed to defend him/herself and had no choice.

Contrast with even bad men love their mamas, which is based on the premise that no one, no matter how bad, would act this way. If it happens before the murderer is born, this is the grandfather paradox. If only the father is killed and it's played for drama then it would be patricide. The extreme version, where a person kills not just their parents but their entire people or clan is genocide from the inside.

One subversion is to have this happen by accident and/or for the parents' death be ultimately caused by their own actions involving the child. If said parent's child also happens to be a Mook of the parent, it can also overlap into the dog bites back.
