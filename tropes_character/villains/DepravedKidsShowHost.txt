Kids' show hosts. They laugh, they sing, they smile, they bring joy to children all over the world... at least, on the surface. But beneath that shiny, happy façade lies the Depraved Kids Show Host, a character you would not, under any circumstances, want your children around.

Unlike his zany-go-lucky cousin, who's excitable but pretty nice off set as well, the Depraved Kids Show Host is at the very least a jerk ass. When he's on air, he's Mr. Snuggles, happiest figure in Friendlytown. But in his down time, he (and it's usually a man) is a sex, drug and gambling addict who drinks, cavorts, and swears enough to make a sailor blush. He smokes like a tilt, lashes out at techies, and absolutely hates kids. or likes them too much.This trope plays on the irony of a jovial character who interacts with children actually being a horrible person. As such, it's related to monster clown and other like tropes.

This is especially popular in real life urban legends, the insinuations of which can ruin someone's career. For some reason, people just can't believe that a right-thinking adult would want to spend his life teaching kids manners and helping them grow as people. Fred Rogers would respectfully disagree; this is generally not truth in television. On the other hand, Fred Rogers wanted to be a kids TV presenter - many others only do it as a way into TV, and, as former kids TV presenter dara ó briain attests, "those people are the most ambitious bunch of pricks you will ever meet." And he's a stand-up comic!See also nice character, mean actor; villain with good publicity. He may also hate the job love the limelight. May exist in a subverted kids show, but most often they're villains in regular shows. In real life, they cause the show to be undermined by reality. Surprisingly, not related to the depraved homosexual or depraved bisexual, although sometimes they overlap.
