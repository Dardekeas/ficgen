You're a power trio or five-man band who just got themselves a new sixth ranger. Things are looking pretty good right now — your team is expanding, you're making new friends. Looks like things might change permanently!

Wait, changing the status quo? gasp, heretic!

Surprise! It turns out your fancy new sixth ranger is evil! He now knows all of your secrets, how to exploit them, and how to push all of your emotional buttons. You've got a new enemy, and the best part is — you'll have an excuse to keep your team down to a power trio or five-man band from now on, so the status quo will remain unchanged.

Just fair warning, this is a trope about betrayal. The names mentioned below may spoil the emotional drama their moment of betrayal brings. However, since Sixth Ranger Traitors tend not to stay with their adoptive teams for long, that may not exactly be much.

Like the sixth ranger, The Sixth Ranger Traitor is its own villainous counterpart in a five-bad band, instead reflecting the member of the group who betrays the others, either by pulling a heel-face turn, or simply for their own ends.

The name is derived from sixth ranger. sub-trope of the mole.
