A long time ago, the Punishment committed a terrible crime. It was decided that the only way to truly make him pay for his deeds was a torture of the darkest supernatural sort. A side-effect to this, however, would be the punished one becoming immortal and/or gaining control of the forces of life/death/darkness itself. The Punishment then uses this new power to bring terror and death to everyone.

Which may prompt the audience to wonder "Wait... they're giving him magic powers and immortality as a punishment?! Is this cursed with awesome or not?" The answer, is, of course, "yes." So now the punishers must face a supernatural being, in as much pain as possible, who hates them even more than before. good move, geniuses. They now have to keep them locked away somehow, but this usually doesn't bite them in the ass. At least, not them. No... it's the present generation's problem. More often than not, the result of a neglectful precursor's bad parenting. If you're lucky, there will be an achilles' heel that can break the Punishment.

Of course, even with great power it's still implied that it hurts. It's sometimes more a punishment to humanity for having allowed such a person to exist. Or, the punisher just doesn't care what kind of threat they would become if free... just as long as the Punishment is in as much pain as possible.
