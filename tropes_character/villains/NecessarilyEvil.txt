A villain may believe that the Ends (involving a utopia or the survival of the species) justify the Means, but has in no way lost his conscience, or otherwise had a heel realization during his deluded time. He knows full well that what he's doing is evil and that heroes may try to bring him to justice for his crimes. He may in fact be counting on it, feeling it to be a just punishment for what he feels he must do. He may bear the heroes no ill will, and may instead commend them for trying to stop him.

Oftentimes, in the event that he succeeds in his goal, he will flat-out refuse to take part in his newfound paradise: the things that he did to create it are inexcusable in the new society.

This is the more anti-villain version of the well-intentioned extremist or knight templar. They will regularly shoot the dog and carry out a zero approval gambit.

He does what he has to do, because he knows that something far worse will happen if he doesn't. He knows he must pay the price for his deeds, but not before his goals are accomplished. what a senseless waste of human life... In some cases, said actions may be unnecessary towards that goal, and there may be a better option, but the character is either too far gone in morality or sanity to see the light.

This trope is the source of much values dissonance in real life. Some do believe that yes, there is such a thing as a necessary evil, and others believe that sort of thinking is wrong and encourages needless suffering.

The polar opposite of the sociopathic hero.
