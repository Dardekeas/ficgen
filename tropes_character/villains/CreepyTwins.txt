Although casting twins on TV are rarely incidental, this is a specific non-comedic use of identical twins who tend to speak, move, and act in tandem just enough to weird out the audience. Usually relegated to villainous or morally ambiguous characters. They may even display an intense, very intimate fondness for each other.

Especially creepy versions may show what amounts to a psychic affinity with each other, being able to finish one another's sentences or divine what the other is thinking/doing when not present.

See also synchronization, finishing each other's sentences, creepy child, emotionless girl, incest, twincest, twin telepathy, brother-sister incest, ho yay. Not the same as evil twin.

half-identical twins can sometimes make this category, especially when they try to look like each other (or switch off with the other twin), and trick people.
