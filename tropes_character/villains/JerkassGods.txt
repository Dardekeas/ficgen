These gods aren't lazy, but you really wish they were.

Perhaps they view all of life as a cosmic game, with humans as mere pawns and tools. Perhaps they're hungry for worship, either literally or figuratively, and are willing to resort to manipulation to get it. Maybe they're just keen on disproportionate retribution (a very common trait in religions throughout history). Maybe it's the age old adage "power corrupts", or maybe they're just trolls, but whatever the case, the deities are just jerks. They view human life as a source of entertainment, or an inconvenience.

This trope is older than dirt. The ur example might be Inanna, Sumerian goddess of getting laid and ultraviolence. As might be expected from someone of that description, she took exception to being spurned by the hero Gilgamesh and summoned a heavenly bull to go on a rampage through his city, and if her father denied her that bull, she would have caused a zombie apocalypse. It did not help that as he turned her down, he listed all her exes and how she arranged their terrible deaths.

Compare and contrast abusive precursors, and for cases where jerkass doesn't really cover it, god of evil, and god is evil; or, for a milder version, consider god is flawed. Related to god and satan are both jerks. Anyone playing religious russian roulette with a Jerkass God probably won't like how it ends. In video games, where you are the god, see cruel player-character god. For the inversion, see god is good.
