It's been said that the villain tends to have the best songs in any given musical, full of flash and gloating. But sometimes, the villain (or perhaps a villain protagonist, anti-villain, or character who made a heel-face turn) has a moment onstage in which they list all of their misdeeds or mistakes... and the audience realizes that the character really, really hates themselves for what they've done, and the song has clearly strayed from fully villainous territory.
