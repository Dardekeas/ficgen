A class of stock character that allows a big bad to operate on a large scale. Evil cousins to the red shirt and yet "technical pacifist" brothers to normal mooks.

Evil Minions are the non combat version of Mooks. They tend to the villain's science labs, clean up the corpses from the shark pools, give the dragon stress relief via being choked or other dog kickery, and generally run around like headless chickens when the hero pushes the big red button.

Usually drawn (if animated) or dressed (if live action) alike in overalls, space clothes, or other utilitarian "science" or "engineer" garb depending on their job. This is so the audience can easily pick them out as nameless and expendable. On the bright side they're rarely completely faceless like other Security Guard mooks, affording them at least some protection from amoral heroic rampages, though they're still "evil" innocent bystanders to the heroes' wrath. If they have lines, expect them to complain about work conditions, desperate need for better insurance, their pay and their bosses' idea of "incentives".
