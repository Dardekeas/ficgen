You've seen it a dozen times since batman in the 1930s:

A villain traumatizes the hero in the opening pages of a comic book's first issue, possibly scarring him physically. Driving the hero to train him/herself into the very definition of a perfect warrior/detective/vigilante/wizard/whatever you will, this scumbag quite literally made the hero what he is today.

One would think that a villain of such importance to the very mythos of the story would be a continue to be a source of character motivation and story importance...

...only that by the final pages of the first issue (or at the end of the first story arc), having served his purpose of making the hero the way he is today, he is unceremoniously disposed of, and almost invariably never spoken of again.

This phenomenon occurs in many retrospectively popular works, which like all fiction must compete in a market that does not give second chances. Particularly in the first productions of many comic and manga authors, one is encouraged to finish his story as soon as possible in case it proves to be unpopular, so the publishers can have an easier time cutting the losses. Only when the successful sales figures come in are the authors forced to bear the awkward responsibility of expanding a story beyond the scope of the now already-dead villain that has created it.

Most Token Motivational Villains are starter villains, although that's not always the case.

They are often left out of adaptations altogether to be replaced by the hero's real nemesis.
