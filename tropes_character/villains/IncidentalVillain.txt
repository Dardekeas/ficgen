Some people have evil as a way of life. Some just have it as a job. But others still have it as a tool, using it to serve their ends but able to use it only as far as they need it. They're perfectly willing to do a crime or hurt people if it suits their needs, but when it doesn't, they're also willing to do things the peaceful way.

Basically, the Incidental Villain is a character who technically is a villain, but he only actually does something worthy of a true villain occasionally; most of the time he's not doing anything particularly bad, only when necessary. The rest of the time, he has no problem playing by the rules or being amiable to our heroes. So, half the time the hero doesn't have to worry, because at the moment the enemy doesn't really care to antagonize: They know he's capable of villainy, but they tolerate him because he's not currently doing anything wrong.

Just don't piss him off, get in his way, or otherwise force his hand. Because if he thinks he needs to deal with you, or even think it might be to his benefit, you will regret it, though a necessary part of this kind of character is that he doesn't actively plot against the heroes. He more or less takes schemes as they come.

A punch clock villain is often this way, due to evil being only a job to him. Note, this character does not go through the heel-face revolving door, because he doesn't actually change sides; he just decides not to do anything evil for lengths of time. If anything, these characters are extremely neutral until they decide to do something devious, and go right back to neutral afterwards.

Compare and contrast with heroic neutral.
