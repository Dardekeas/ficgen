There is a rightful holder of some position of authority â€” the throne, the presidency, the chairmanship of a company, or something else. But someone with a lesser claim, or no claim at all, in some way manages to grab the position.

How this is done varies. The Usurper might have managed to drive out the rightful holder in disgrace. He might have managed to kill the previous holder while the rightful heir is unable to respond. He might have pulled off a classical coup. However, one thing is always in common: the move to power is almost always done clandestinely, except maybe in the final phases of a coup. The main exception to the clandestine behaviour is when the rightful authority is away for some reason, and have trusted the usurper to run things.

The displaced and rightful holder may end up as man in the iron mask, noble fugitive, the exile. May cause a civil war. Often appears with the evil prince, the mole in charge, or the evil vizier. Frequently ends in rightful king returns.

Fiction being fiction, this is often bad, and it's usually truth in television as well, though for different reasons. See the wrongful heir to the throne.

the other wiki has a list of historical usurpers, not all of them wholly bad.
