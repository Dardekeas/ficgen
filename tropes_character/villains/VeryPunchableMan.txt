A bit character whose only purpose is to deserve a beating, and get it from the hero.

People love to be badass, and people love badasses. But if you try to be a badass when there's no bad around, you're just an ass. You see?

But don't worry, someone will come along any minute now to pick a fight with you, mug you, threaten you, or something like that. It doesn't matter how long you stay manfully stoic in the face of their crap, they'll keep at it until whatever you want to do to them looks completely justified.

Hey, someone's getting beaten up! Why? Because! Clearly, that poor guy isn't as badass as the hero. Have at them!

This is very common in the superhero narrative, where heroes do tend to witness terrible crimes even when they're just wandering around. It can also be used in a casual, less idealistic way, when a guy in a bar is obnoxious, and your badass can wipe them out (see the quote above). If you need people to bond over a rescue, a bad guy can provide a handy bit of danger.

A common variation is to have a woman get sexually harassed, and kick the guy in the crotch, to show that she's tough and empowered.

It can even be used with a villain, if you think they're a bit too calm and collected to kick the dog for no reason.
