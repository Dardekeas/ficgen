An inverted form of the man behind the man. Rather than a new evil being behind an old villain, an old villain is behind a new one.

This is common for iconic villains (such as many of the ones from nintendo games) with joker immunity â€” no matter how many times the hero beats them, they keep coming back in the next game. Frequently, they even retry the same evil plot.

This can be a subversion of outside-context villain, in that the outside-context villain (the original) is actually subordinate to a villain who is not outside context. Similarly, it could be that the original outside-context villain is not actually the big bad, but instead the replacement. See also bigger bad.

Nothing to do with hijacked by jesus.

Inverse of make way for the new villains.
