In real life, "cult" is a pejorative-laden term for what is more objectively termed a new religious movement. These groups are, as the term suggests, religions of recent origin. They struggle with small membership, low social standing (generally), and a nigh-unbreakable association with a single charismatic figure (which can be devastating if this person is still alive and capable of scandals and social missteps). All this, coupled with the understandable anger of established groups at being labeled "cults," means that fiction is likely to stick to a tropable stereotype (which is interesting) over an accurate depiction of a new religious movement (which is likely to be offensive and/or boring).

You can expect a fictional new religious movement to fall under one of the following:

In SF series, it's likely that what they worship is real, and at the very least more powerful than anything they have experienced before; see sufficiently advanced alien and god guise. In comedy, it's common to build one around something truly ridiculous.A cult-like cabal is often at the center of an ancient conspiracy.

Many aspects of the standard depiction are drawn from real events, based on such incidents as jonestown, the Heaven's Gate, the Branch Davidian incident in Waco, Texas, and others. Expect there to be an element of religious horror. If a cult is being played for humor value, it will usually very closely resemble the Church of Scientology.

Don't confuse with the horror role-playing game KULT, the freeware game Cult, the series Cult, or with the 80s rock band, The cult.

Even the most well-regarded cults should not be confused with cult classics, which are almost always entirely different.

Former Cult members are given to coming up with religion rant songs once disaffected.
