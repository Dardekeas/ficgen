A Heroism Addict is an individual who craves the attention and glory that comes with heroism...and thus, creates a catastrophe to play the hero in.

The Heroism Addict suffers from Hero Syndrome, a real life disorder most often found in firefighters, in cases where they are also arsonists who start fires so they can get recognition from putting them out, or similar jobs like emergency workers or the police. Usually they are also losers â€” they have huge egos, but they tend to be low on the hierarchy of whatever job they have (for example, a Deputy who thinks he should be Sheriff), and thus their delusions of grandeur do not match their reality. Acting the hero thus gives them the chance to be the center of attention before they go back to their menial work.

Hero Syndrome is a fairly common trope in fiction and serves as a textbook example of evil cannot comprehend good. It is a symptom of Narcissism; it is pathologically self-centered, and involves a callous disregard for the victim. A Heroism Addict does not care at all about the people they are supposedly "saving" and are only interested in the glory, whereas the true hero traditionally always cares about the people they are saving and, while they may be susceptible to thrill-seeking and the limelight, they don't let that override their sense of duty and empathy. This guy, however, has a warped sense of duty and no sense of empathy; hence, he is almost always a villain, or at best an anti-hero.

Needless to say, has nothing to do with chronic hero syndrome, which is about real heroes. Might be related to munchausen by proxy. Compare fake ultimate hero, glory hound.
