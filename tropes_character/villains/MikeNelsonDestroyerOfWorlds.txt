Plotting to destroy the planet is a good source of conflict for your standard evil overlord, but, when it comes right down to it, destroying the world isn't really a very effective evil plan â€” especially if it's the world the evil overlord is living on: it's where he keeps his stuff. Basically, plotting to destroy the planet is a good way to demonstrate that you're evil, but there are hardly any situations in which this sort of destruction is going to have any sort of value for the villain.

Once this is understood, you find yourself in the curious situation where the sort of fellow who goes around destroying worlds isn't actively evil. More often, he's more a sort of buffoon. A guy who just doesn't have the sense of responsibility or the ability to wrap his mind around the consequences of his actions to realize that blowing up a planet is a particularly bad idea. Or, just as likely, does it purely by accident.

Compare with the omnicidal maniac, the "serious" version of this trope who can wrap his head around the concept and wants to do it anyway. If this goes to the next step and the destruction is only really caused by the character's indirect actions, then the character is a doom magnet (though the normal version of this also applies as well).

Not to be confused with woobie, destroyer of worlds, who wants to destroy everything because of past mistreatment. Can be considered a subtrope of nice job breaking it, hero.
