Somewhere between satan and the legions of hell are these guys: Maybe the setting doesn't want to deal with a single representative of all evil, maybe they felt dividing the stuff up makes for more fun intra-demon politicking. Maybe they felt it allowed for more specialization and character, or maybe it's easier to deal with underlings than Old Scratch himself.

For whatever reasons there are these guys: usually with names taken from the Apocrypha, ars goetia or Dante's Inferno, these guys can be described as Almost-Satan, for when the real deal isn't as fun to use. They're often given fancy titles and pretty much do whatever satan would have done had he been present. Also, if you actually kill one or stop their schemes, it's still an accomplishment, but it's hardly a collapse of the demonic system. There will always be another to replace the one that falls. perhaps even the killer. Keep in mind, killing one is a lot harder than it sounds, because miraculously driving one's hit points to zero usually involves fighting a shadow.

Common in all sorts of fantasy works, usually serving under a god of evil (or possibly satan himself) and plotting against them. May be the center of a religion of evil or the true identity of the being worshiped by a path of inspiration. This trope is the evil counterpart of the council of angels, although these guys tend to be a lot less likely to cooperate with each other. When the enemy civil war breaks out, they're the ones in charge of either side.

Compare and contrast the legions of hell for the grunts and satan for the big guy himself. See also our demons are different. Much like deer, the size of their horns can denote their status. Typically also a monster lord. See also, elite mook.

The good equivalent are either called celestial paragons or simply archangels.
