We know about the evil uncle. It looks like nephews in these families have a difficult time.

But don't think that uncles always have it fine. Sometimes they can be the ones who have trouble. This trope is for Uncles who get badly treated, sometimes they are the butt monkey, sometimes they are subject to avunculicide, the act of killing an uncle.

This can happen when the nephew is the one who succeeds to power and the uncle is still a member of court. But his nephew may be the caligula and treat the uncle badly.
