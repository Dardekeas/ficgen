A killer is on the loose. Sometimes the killer is a person, but more often it's some sort of supernatural monster. Many people... dozens sometimes, and sometimes even hundreds... of people have fallen to this fiend. No one's noticed because the killer only comes out to play every few years, or every few decades, or even every few centuries. Regardless of the time involved, no one has connected this long string of victims.

At least, no one has put two-and-two together until now. Our intrepid hero is the only one clever or lucky enough to connect the dots. Now if he can only convince someone that the same killer who murdered those prostitutes a hundred years ago is the same killer murdering prostitutes today without being accused of being the killer and left unprotected in a jail cell.

A specific type of vicious cycle. May overlap with horror doesn't settle for simple tuesday, or theme serial killer. If the killer is a supernatural being, it is often a case of as long as there is evil.

If this happens monthly, it may be menstrual menace or lunacy. (werewolves are especially prone to the latter.) A particularly regular comet of doom could also count.

And this is a death trope, so expect UNMARKED SPOILERS!
