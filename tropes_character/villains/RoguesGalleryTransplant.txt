Also known as The Supervillain Shuffle. The occurrence wherein a villain, originally introduced as an enemy for a specific hero, subtly through time or continuity creep, deliberately or unintentionally, becomes more identified with another hero.

While any shared universe may depict a hero fighting another's antagonist, usually they remain identified with the original. For instance, superman may occasionally fight the joker, but no one would claim the latter is anything but a batman villain. This trope refers specifically to characters that have reached the narrative point where the villain is now more identified in the popular consciousness as being an adversary to a character he did not originally fight.

Often occurs when an obscure character is used in a recent popular work or adaptation. In many cases, it also happens when the villain is better suited to another hero either thematically or with regard to powers, especially if the themes or powers of the hero have changed in the interim. Can also be the result of a writer creating a villain while writing for one character, then moving on to another project and taking all of their toys with them.
