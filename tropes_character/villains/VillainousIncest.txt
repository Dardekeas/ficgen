So you have a character who is a villain. He's kicked puppies, tortured defenseless kittens, and done everything he can to make sure he has thoroughly crossed the moral event horizon. What else can you do to show the audience that he is absolutely evil in every way?

You have him engage in certain taboo or questionable activities which are frowned upon by most cultures. Sure, even bad men love their mamas, but some bad men love their mamas a little too much, and this adds to the audience's view of the villain as a disgusting, depraved individual who commits evil and unnatural acts on a daily basis.

Compare brother-sister incest, parental incest, good people have good sex.

Contrast surprise incest for when the people involved may or may not know they are related, although these kinds of villains usually don't care. Can cross over with freudian excuse if it's implied to be rooted in child abuse.
