Someone in the main cast discovers a shocking secret about the past of the resident jerkass. Apparently, difficult as it may be to imagine, he may actually not be that bad a guy. Somewhere, buried deep inside, there's a pet the dog moment that shows he's really a jerk with a heart of gold.

Well, yeah, turns out that isn't really true. There's a perfectly selfish explanation for why he saved the busload of burning orphans - they're his secret team of kid snitches. And now he's going to get a good laugh at your expense for ever thinking he could be so noble.

While one cannot be both a jerk with a heart of gold AND a jerk with a heart of jerk simultaneously, it is possible for a character to alternate between the two (as a result of "depending on the writer" for instance) and character development can cause evolution in either direction.

That said, these tropes are almost polar opposites by definition. The former Jerkass is, when it comes to the crunch, a decent guy. The latter Jerkass is, under all that jerkassery...a bigger jerk/asshole. This trope also subverts hidden heart of gold. Compare and contrast bitch in sheep's clothing and sheep in sheep's clothing. For the more malicious, see for the evulz, the sociopath and pragmatic villainy. Also contrast jerkass fa√ßade, also pretty much a polar opposite. May also go hand in hand with good flaws, bad flaws: a character may have a Good Flaw, then repent and apologize for it...only to turn out to have a Bad Flaw.
