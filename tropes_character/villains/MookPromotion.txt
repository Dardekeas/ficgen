You know this guy. You've seen him before. There are a million others like him, and they're all the same. He's just another minor pawn in the big bad's army. He probably doesn't even have a name. And yet...

Sometimes, a basic generic minion isn't content with remaining so. Instead, this character, initially so insignificant that you might not even think of them as a character, becomes a major antagonist. This may be achieved through actual promotion (klingon-style or otherwise), through a transformation, or through doing something so vile that they personally become the target of the wrath of the fanbase. Alternatively, the writer may simply give the character more and more lines and appearances until they become a significant villain through sheer familiarity. In video games they may take the form of a regular enemy who functions as a level boss, making them an inversion of degraded boss.

After all, every villain has to start somewhere. Maybe even the big bad was a mook once.

Contrast villain decay, where a major antagonist becomes less major as a series progresses, as well as boss in mook clothing, where the enemy is clearly meant to be a "basic generic minion" but is as tough as a boss. See also not-so-harmless villain.

See dragon ascendant for the next step up the career ladder. See also mauve shirt and ascended extra for a similar promotion to a member of the redshirt army.

May overlap with chekhov's gunman, since the boss looks generic at first, but if he shows up more times he becomes important.
