A sadist teacher in charge of an entire educational institution. This guy hates the protagonist and his friends with a passion. He has the entire institution with its long history and dignified reputation on his side. Its arbitrary and ancient rules exist chiefly for him to abuse in his vendetta.

Dean Bitterman is a pompous and sour old killjoy who is opposed to the merest hint of fun. He believes that it cheapens the good name of the institution. However, don't expect this disdain to be evenly applied; he'll suck up shamelessly to wealthly parents. He favors the children of alumni and big donors. He has no problem with letting them get away with murder. He is quite blind to their obnoxiousness and malevolence â€” and the fact they are much worse than the heroes would ever be. In lay terms, double standard is on full display on his watch.

If you don't come from old money or have a trust fund, or even if you just happen to be in a fraternity that he disapproves of, then heaven help you.

The Dean Bitterman is the ideological nemesis of the high school hustler, who will make it a life mission to irritate the Dean and subvert his authority at every opportunity. Expect the hustler and his friends to be expelled at some point, only to take their elaborate revenge in the climax.

If Dean Bitterman is temporarily taking the place of a more likable character, then he is starring in a tyrant takes the helm story arc. The classic Dean Bitterman is found in colleges and universities. Sometimes he turns up at high schools.

In terms of rank, the authority tropes arguably at the next step down are badass preacher, corrupt corporate executive, irish priest, landlord, preacher man, pedophile priest, schoolteachers, sinister minister, and the vicar. For the next step up, see majorly awesome.
