This is someone the hero used to be with, but broke it off. Said Ex is not good with rejection.

You can expect the Ex to become a stalker with a crush. Many times, the Ex will become a villain because love makes you evil. Despite the obvious gender differentiation in the title, it is not always female.

Oh and god help anyone our hero dated after this loon. they will suffer. Sometimes the hero will be targeted as well.

There are, at times, sympathetic Psycho Exes. Such as, if the break-up occurred because of the hero being a two-timing jerk at the time.

This is about the person who went nuts because of the break up. We also have tropes for: someone the hero knew was evil when they started dating, someone who turned out to be a psycho within the relationship, and someone who was turned into a psycho out of the blue in order to kill off the relationship.
