Classic villain type in children's stories and films, a person who cannot stand children. At all. It may range from them being very irritated by them but not saying anything to seething hatred of insane comedic levels, but whatever the case, they simply do not like them. Typically but not always female, and often a glamorous woman with a shallow personality. The fact that they themselves were once a child never seems to cross their mind, though, in a few cases, said child hater may have had a difficult childhood filled with trying to deal with other, less than kind children. Ironically, for some reason they have a tendency to have a career that involves working with children, such as a camp counselor or a sadist teacher. They may be in a job that focuses on children (teacher, host of a children's TV show, toymaker), or as a particular type of depraved kids' show host.

If one of these is trying to marry a single parent, expect the Child Hater to make plans to ship the poor kid or kids off to boarding school so they can have the parent all to themselves.

Needless to say, it's highly probable that such a character would hurt a child, but it isn't obligatory. In extreme cases, they may even aim for a full-on childless dystopia.

Contrast friend to all children, who is often the natural enemy of this kind of villain.

It should be noted that some people in real life dislike children, but more information is ''not'' necessary.
