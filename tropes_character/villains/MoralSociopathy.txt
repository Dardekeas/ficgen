Sociopaths are essentially the human version of always chaotic evil in media. Since we consider morality to be good, they are naturally depicted as selfish and immoral.

While it is somewhat truth in television, sociopaths are still human, and it's not unnatural that sociopaths have a sense of right and wrong, even though it is completely different from what other people consider that to be. Many diagnosed sociopaths are known to have moral codes, either usually unique to them or ocassionally already set. Naturally, since these types of morality focus more on abstract concepts rather than the people themselves, expect some rather nasty extremism.

By definition, a sociopath is largely or totally incapable of guilt, compassion, empathy, or remorse — thus, whenever they subscribe to a moral code, said code will either be reinterpreted or be amoral from the outset. They might feel "bad" about doing something they think is wrong, or that goes against their code, but they won't feel guilty and will shrug it off as just one of those things, or justify what they did to themselves as being the needs of the many, no matter how much insane troll logic they have to employ to reach that conclusion. They can also like people without actually caring for them all that much.

See also principles zealot, when one is completely obsessed with his/her moral code; some moral sociopaths are evil versions of these as well, as they care more about their moral code than people themselves. However, moral sociopaths need not to be always overwhelmed by extremism; a few can just be nominal hero, which while lacking empathy, still have a moral code to restrict them in some ways. Also compare/contrast black and white insanity and sociopathic hero.

This is not to be confused with übermensch. Moral sociopaths can have their own unique moral codes, but they are just as likely to adhere to already established things like Christianity and Communism.
