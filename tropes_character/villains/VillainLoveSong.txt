The song sung by a villain who is attempting to seduce another character.

Generally not a full-blown villain song â€” hey, the villain's trying to impress someone, and blatantly reveling in puppy-punting has a knack for driving away potential love interests. Villains in love with other villains go under unholy matrimony.

Contrast final love duet.
