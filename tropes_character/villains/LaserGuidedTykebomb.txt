You're the big bad and all your evil plans are thwarted. The hero can take anything you can dish out and then some, the mooks cower in the corner whenever he so much as looks at them, and the dragon is kindly recommending that you run for the hills. Can nobody stop this unstoppable juggernaut of justice? The answer is no.

Enter the laser-guided tykebomb, a henchman with one purpose in life and one purpose only: to take down the good guys. The LGT may be a specially constructed robot, a human raised from birth to carry out the deed or normal minion promoted from the ranks to fill the role. This nemesis will often have powers designed to counter or match its targets, or be equipped to exploit his kryptonite factor.

Another scenario has a character feeling a face-heel turn coming on, so they need someone to kill them as a kind of suicide by cop, except no "Cop" is strong enough so they have to make their own.

Can often overlap with hero killer.

Heroes have been known to be created this way to destroy specific villains, in which case their creators are generally morally dubious.

Subtrope of tykebomb.
