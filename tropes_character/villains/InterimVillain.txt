Whenever a big bad is defeated, goes missing, or escapes, an interim villain is neatly placed between the fall and reemergence of the previous big bad.

The interim villain introduces a new side of the story via providing a credible antagonist to challenge the characters, without taking anything away from the story in the same way that an arc villain might. It might take a while before the fans warm up to an interim villain, particularly if you go with the (unrecommended) route of a suspiciously similar substitute.

As another cog in the sorting algorithm of evil, an interim villain may range from anywhere between a breather boss (by comparison) to a hero killer, depending on the portrayal. They can be connected to the previous big bad, or they can be completely independent - it's your choice.

In order to spot an interim villain, their predecessor must still be at large (including situations involving resurrection or incarceration), and the interim villain themselves must return after their own defeat. Their significance to the plot can vary, but it's fine as long as they actually impact the story or characters in some way.

This still counts even when an interim villain is placed between the fall of the disc one final boss and the emergence of his successor. If you pick this scenario, it can sometimes lead to the big bad shuffle.

Contrast arc villain (standalone antagonists in general), predecessor villain (the antagonist of the backstory) and disc one final boss (who's ousted halfway through the plot).
