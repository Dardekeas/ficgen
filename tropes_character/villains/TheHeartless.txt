The Heartless are different from the average monster of the week in that they're basically born out of people's negative emotions, like a poltergeist. They can be a special case of the body horror, but can also be a part of the victim's soul anatomy that has been separated from them, and may not have a physical body at all. This is convenient for the right villain, since it can be an unlimited resource; the victim of the week always seems loaded with problems and angst for The Heartless to feed on. It can also have a self-propagating "zombie" effect.

The trouble for the heroes is these are difficult to get rid of, especially if The Heartless still display an awareness of the world (usually, as a ruse of the enigmatic minion). If an established character becomes one of The Heartless, they may act as if they had undergone a face-heel turn.

The all-loving hero's power is usually to combat The Heartless, or even to heal them. The anti-hero or well-intentioned extremist usually insists the victims are too far gone and should be offed before more people get hurt. Occasionally, a victim who is fighting from the inside can resist The Heartless' control.

Depending on the context, this trope is a subtrope of abstract apotheosis. This is because nearly every series that this trope is used in represent these critters as an aesop about them being in everyone's hearts. Contrast/See also made of evil.

Obligatory heart drive link thrown in for good measure.

Not to be confused with the let's player of the same name or the single Heartless by heart.
