They are cute, sweet, innocent and extremely huggable. Incidentally they are also varying shades of violent, unstable, and downright insane.

Cute and Psycho is a trope that describes characters who are genuinely cute in both appearance and mannerisms but have a completely batshit crazy side. Sometimes there are distinctly different sides which may be shown equally, but other times they are mostly one or the other, the killer rabbit displaying moments of sweetness and relative-sanity or the cutie showing hints of a dark psychotic nature. Often there is some kind of dark and troubled past, or split personality to justify how the two aspects of the person can both be genuine, but other times no explanation is revealed.

The primary difference between this trope and the yandere is that the Cute and Psycho character is not driven by an obsessive need to possess a friend or lover. Their motivation, if they have one, can vary immensely. They also don't necessarily have to be provoked to enter their Psycho-state, but can switch for reasons observers would be hard-pressed to determine.

Cute and Psycho is a sister trope to killer rabbit, yandere and enfant terrible, and closely related to psychopathic manchild and beware the nice ones, though while there is frequent overlap between these tropes being one doesn't necessarily mean a character qualifies for another. If the "cute" part isn't real, then the character is the fake cutie instead. Characters of this type tend to be female, though male examples do exist. the ophelia is someone whose psychosis is part of the cute picture, rather than a contrasted to it.

In some anime fandoms this character is referred to as a yangire, an informal fanspeak term which is a portmanteau of yandere and kireru (a word meaning "to snap or lose one's temper"). It's also used to refer to ax-crazy versions of the fake cutie. Not to be confused with fangire, which is a species of monster vampire.
