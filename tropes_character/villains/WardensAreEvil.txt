A character gets sent to the slammer. He or she might fear or dread several aspects of the incarceration, including lack of freedom, abuse by other prisoners/guards, and bad food. But none of those are the scariest thing about the prison. Nope, it's the warden.

The prison's warden will be a heartless, soulless monster dedicated to abusing and bullying prisoners in the most brutal ways possible. Alternatively, he or she will torment prisoners emotionally by saying hurtful words and putting them down. or it could be both. Bonus points if his or her actions are illegal themselves. Double bonus points if he/she gets busted and becomes an inmate in the prison they once ruled with an iron fist.

Don't even think about thinking about crossing him or her, and don't even think about thinking about escaping. if you do, the punishment will make you wish you were dead (assuming it doesn't involve death).

Note that this doesn't necessarily have to be a prison warden; it could just be the commander of a prison-like institution. Compare corrupt politician, screw the rules, i make them! Contrast reasonable authority figure.
