The whole world's going to hell. Crime, corruption, moral degeneration, and a soft, weak government that can't do a thing to help. In comes this guy, promising to end all that—and being the idiots we are, we elect him, or at least wildly applaud his coup d'état. Once he seizes power, he may become the generalissimo.

The Glorious Leader is a political outsider who uses romantic and idealist rhetoric to hide some malevolent agenda. He talks lovingly about the good old ways and/or the great new age he will bring about, and every other sentence out of his mouth is a new era speech. Bonus points if he fingers some other group of outsiders as The Enemy, blaming them for the degenerate modern era, or decides the country ought to go to war on some implausible pretext just to prove its military strength.

The trope codifier, of course, is adolf hitler. Other examples: mr. saxon, darth sidious, tyranic leaders all over 20th-century, otto von bismarck, josef stalin, and mao zedong.

Contrast dark messiah, who this guy is dangerously close to becoming if there's a religious angle to the story.
