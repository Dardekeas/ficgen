Some people just aren't cut out for villainy. The harmless villain, those suffering from massive villain decay, those who want to be evil, but can't just get that pesky "no moral compass" part down, and sometimes heroes disguised as villains — God bless 'em — their idea of evil is harmless behavior like cheating at Solitaire, jaywalking, chewing gum in Singapore, pulling the "do not remove" tag off of your mattress, hiding your toothpaste, drinking the milk directly from the carton, and (gasp!) not wiping their feet before they come in your house, and (maybe) refusing to apologize for it afterwards. mwahahaha!So, here's to those villains who should consider a new career — specifically the moments when they really show how wanting for evil they are. They don't really have it in them to kick the dog, so they Poke The Poodle.

If a henchman is the one who can't maintain a minimum level on villainy, he's a minion with an f in evil.

If a character Kicks the Dog and Pokes Poodles, it just goes to show that evil is petty. If the latter comes up in his list of offenses, it's arson, murder, and jaywalking. When the Poodle Poking is used as a punishment, it's cool and unusual punishment.

Compare kick the son of a bitch, where a kick the dog moment seems to be perfectly justified to the audience, due to the asshole victim, and the family for the whole family. Contrast a lighter shade of grey. For when this is treated in-universe as a terrible thing, see felony misdemeanor. Usually unrelated to stop poking me.

A lot of jokes about digital piracy is evil are built this way. The polar opposite to this trope is moral event horizon.
