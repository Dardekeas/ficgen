The Usual Adversaries are similar to goddamned bats, but while goddamned bats is a gameplay trope, The Usual Adversaries is a narrative one. goddamned bats may annoy the hell out of you when you play a game, but The Usual Adversaries are what annoy the hell out of your characters in the universe.

The Usual Adversaries refers to the ubiquitous always chaotic evil creatures that are always messing everything up for everyone in a setting, and the hatred towards said creatures held by the good forces who are always having to fight them off. Naturally, this varies by setting, though orcs are among the most common in Fantasy works.

Related to always chaotic evil, scary dogmatic aliens, hard-coded hostility, villain by default, aliens and monsters, and the heartless. May even be the over-trope into which they all fit.
