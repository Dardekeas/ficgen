A significant subtrope of scary dogmatic aliens, the Absolute Xenophobe does not work and play well with others. Whether from instinct or acculturation, these aliens are horrified at the mere idea that other sentient life exists, and will not rest until they have annihilated every other intelligent species they know of. Differs from the virus, horde of alien locusts, planet looters, et cetera in that the Xenophobes don't necessarily gain anything other than a (false?) sense of security from their wars â€” they don't want to eat us, transform us, or scavenge resources from our planet (although that's a bonus); they just want us dead and gone.

See also the equally though less expansively genocidal feeling oppressed by their existence and kill all humans, and the even more extreme omnicidal maniac.

If this xenophobia is a result of cultural influences, it may be possible to knock some sense into them and make peace. If this kind of xenophobia is innate, it's probably them or us. Such aliens may bear a resemblance to (or, as in the case of the daleks, be explicitly based on) those wacky nazis. Compare hard-coded hostility. Contrast intrigued by humanity, or the xenophile. Compare and contrast the master race, who may want to kill other races/species but would rather conquer them.
