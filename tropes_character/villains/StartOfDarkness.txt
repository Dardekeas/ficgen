nobody is born evil (well, except maybe the enfant terrible). Something usually happened to push a villain down the path to villainy. And hey, mightn't that make an interesting story?

Keep in mind that the reasons aren't always good ones, if there is such a thing as a good reason for turning evil.

Much of the plot is often a foregone conclusion, often ending in the bad guy wins or pyrrhic villainy; many characters are doomed by canon, which may require a full kill 'em all to explain why they don't show up in the original work.
