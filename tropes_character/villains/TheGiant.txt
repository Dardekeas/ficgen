In your basic professional wrestling promotion, there's one guy who's much bigger than everyone else. Usually at least a head taller than the next-tallest man on the roster, and a mountain of muscle (and fat) to boot. So, of course, the promoters advertise him as an unstoppable killing machine, regardless of the big man's (lack of) talent.

Such men are almost universally introduced and pushed the same way as "monster" heels, sometimes mixed with an foreign wrestling heel vibe. Because of their billing, they will usually be pushed straight to the top to face off with the top face, whom they'll generally squash in their first meeting, to give you an idea of how Herculean an effort will be required to defeat them.

An important distinction between The Giant and just being large is that The Giant will have sheer immovability and too often a noticeable lack in the talent department, having a very small repertoire of basic strikes and throws or being slow/not possessing wrestling psychology. While some with the Giant gimmick will disprove some of the stereotypes by showing a more diverse range of moves along with decent fitness and mobility, their in ring style and psychology are still built almost entirely around being large and hard to budge. jim ross used to refer to these types of wrestlers as 'Hoss'es, after Hoss Cartwright from Bonanza.

If the angle goes on long enough, The Giant might get a heel-face turn, rebelling on the manager who brought him in and going his own way. This usually results in them no longer being unstoppable.

Related to muscles are meaningful (large means slow and strong). Comparable to smash mook. For mythical giants, see our giants are bigger
