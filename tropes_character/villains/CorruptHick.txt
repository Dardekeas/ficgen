The rural southern u.s., and indeed, the rural north of england, are apparently full of small towns run by evil hicks of some sort. His control over the town may be political, economic, religious, or purely criminal, but in most cases it gradually expands to "all of the above".

One of the most obvious hallmarks of a town run by a Corrupt Hick is the apparent lack of a judicial system. It seems the Corrupt Hick can just go around arresting whoever he wants for no reason without them ever getting a trial. If there's a courthouse in town, it's certainly not being used. (On the rare occasion there is a trial, it will have a hanging judge who will be on the payroll.) In all these respects, the Corrupt Hick is effectively a modern-day version of the feudal overlord of yore. Though the fact that he was probably elected due to his popularity will usually be ignored.

He will almost certainly wear a hat, probably carry a gun, will probably chew tobacco, is almost always white, and is virtually always male. Good odds of being a fat, sweaty southerner in a white suit.

The underlings of a Corrupt Hick will be either corrupt themselves or clueless. Areas that tolerate corrupt hicks generally don't get reformed from inside. If it's a horror story, he may be keeping a madwoman in the attic.

walking the earth shows, particularly those set in the modern day, run into a lot of these. And virtually every adventure series or cop show made in the 1970s, whether it be Cannon or The Six Million Dollar Man or Wonder Woman had at least one episode featuring the corrupt hick scenario (so much so in fact that it's fair to refer to this not only as a trope, but a full-out clich√©).

Here is the wikipedia page for hillbilly. Please see the following wikipedia pages of Appalachia, The Ozarks, and Southern United States. These are three areas where hillbillies are often located.
