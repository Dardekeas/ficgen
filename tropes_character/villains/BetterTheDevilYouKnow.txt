Finally, after a long struggle, our heroes have managed to defeat the big bad, but waitâ€”they can't just kill them. That would be terrible! Because as soon as you kill the big bad, something else will come along to take his place. Maybe the man behind the man shows up, or maybe the sorting algorithm of evil kicks in. Maybe the balance between good and evil means that someone else will just become the new big bad, or maybe it's just inherent in the system, but the fact you've won doesn't mean it's over.

Sure, the big bad may be evil, but at least as long as he's around, you know what you're up against. You know his weaknesses, you know how he thinks, and you know how to deal with him. and you know what he won't do. But if someone new takes over, suddenly you're right back to square one and you have to figure out how to beat them all over again.

If the big bad actually does get dispatched despite this, the heroes may soon find themselves wishing for the return of the old big bad, and in extreme cases, may even try to restore him to power. (If possible.)

Related to we want our jerk back, friendly enemy, and worthy opponent. bread and circuses or villain with good publicity may also invoke this trope if removing the big bad will cause public backlash, or the heroes may fear an evil power vacuum.
