It's not that evil is cool. Rather, this is more like "Evil is Intellectual." Evil is smart, wicked, sarcastic with a biting sense of humor. Evil is smooth and eloquent, if not outright suave. Evil dresses well, has a polysyllabic lexicon, quotes william shakespeare, sips fine wine, listens to his favorite opera on his downtime, and in general is shown to be cultured if not necessarily civilized. This can apply to any villain, anti-villain, or associated character types.

May overlap with dumb is good, but it doesn't have to. The hero of the story can easily be a more rugged intellectual, or he reads/writes poetry, which is almost never perceived as an "evil" form of culture (cf. the warrior poet trope). Closely related to the magnificent bastard, whose sheer tactical and strategic brilliance often sets him inside the trappings of Wicked Cultured (particularly when he catches you and then explains which strategic genius first invented that trap). faux affably evil is a similar overlap of highbrow manners and vicious actions.

When aristocrats are evil, they almost always follow this trope; when enough of them do, you get deadly decadent court. They are likely to practice brains and bondage without any trace of safe, sane and consensual.

Arguably this trope carries unfortunate implications: people who enjoy pop culture are average joes and probably the protagonists, but those who like "high" culture are a bit weird, "other", and more likely to be antagonists. There's also significant overlap with dumb is good.

Compare the less sinister villains out shopping, villainous fashion sense, and man of wealth and taste. The exact opposite of this is a gentleman and a scholar (unless he is affably evil). Someone who keeps trying to be this but whose plans end up less clear, simple, and effective may have a complexity addiction.

Not to be confused with sophisticated as hell.
