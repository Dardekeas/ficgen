A dead unicorn trope in murder mysteries, essentially a form of the dog was the mastermind that's too well-known to use.

The stereotypical example is that a bunch of people are invited to a dinner in a wealthy man's house, and the wealthy man is poisoned while they are all eating dinner. All the guests debate who among them is the killer, only to discover at the end of the story that the killer is the butler, whom nobody bothered to think twice about; he's just part of the furniture, as if the table was the culprit.

The butler is the avatar of the most unlikely suspect that, of course, turns out to be guilty because the author wasn't creative enough to come up with a better way to surprise the reader. It's the mystery writer equivalent of the ass pull, except that you can see it coming a mile away, making it, for modern readers, the untwist. Ironically, because this trope is so well known, when an 'actual' butler is involved he rarely 'did it', or when he did then it's often a parody and played for laughs.

The expression "The butler did it" was probably coined by novelist Mary Roberts Rinehart, although it's likely to be a real-world example of beam me up, scotty!. The earliest verified explicit statement of disapproval dates to S.S. Van Dine's 1928 essay "Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories" (it might be noted that these rules would disqualify the authors who defined the genre, including wilkie collins, edgar allan poe, and arthur conan doyle). This article explores in detail the origin of this strange semi-existent trope. It's possibly related to the real life stereotype that, if something goes missing in a home, the hired help likely stole it.

It is okay, however, for a butler to be a suspect, primarily to mislead the reader.

Not to be confused with a wizard did it.

obviously, ending spoilers follow.
