The character is a noble, or at least decent, soldier, who doesn't like the policies of their nation and/or state, but fights for it anyway. This person is loyal to their nation, not its leader. Exactly how noble or decent someone can be while helping their organisation do questionable deeds because it is "their duty" varies depending on the specific character and their actions. moral dissonance is something anyone can have and evil leaders are very good at promoting and exploiting nationalism, particularly when it comes to inter-national conflict and war. One does often wonder why someone so honorable fights for an evil cause rather than deserting. At worst, this sort of thing can lead to the "I was just following orders" defense. More positively, it may result in them questioning their blind obedience and defecting or rebelling.

The title is a common variation from a quote from the USA's naval commander Stephen Decatur...which is all too often taken out of context. For immediately beforehand, Decatur had toasted: "To our country! In her intercourse with foreign nations, may she always be in the right." Later, the USA's Senator Carl Schurz gave his own interpretation of the statement: "My country, right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right." This latter take, along with similar anecdotes from others, has also come into prominence in how both nationalism and patriotism are portrayed.

No Real Life Examples, Please!. Which country is "wrong" or "right" is extremely subjective because widespread, unconscious belief in the principles of nationalism makes people believe that their chosen nation is always 'more right'. Let's not start up a flame war over this, thanks guys.

Compare realpolitik, my master, right or wrong, lawful stupid, just following orders and tautological templar.
