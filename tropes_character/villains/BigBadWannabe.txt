The Big Bad Wannabe is a villain who is seen as a significant threat but can't back it up when it comes to the crunch. The absolute level of menace varies widely, from an ineffectual sympathetic villain having a good day, to a villain who could legitimately be the big bad if the real Big Bad wasn't even more badass than they are, but within a story they are (initially) presented as a big deal.

There are a lot of ways of building up a baddie. In a slice of life show a school bully might just talk tough. In a more action oriented work the wannabe might beat up a tough hero to look even tougher: the worf effect.

There are also many ways of revealing the villain is an over-inflated threat. A school bully might run from a real fight. In the second example worf had the flu â€” an unfair circumstance gave the villain his early victory. Sometimes it's just a matter of scale; the heroes catch a murderer, but he's just a copycat, not the real mastermind serial killer he was thought to be. Alternatively the real Big Bad might outdo the wannabe or even kill the wannabe. Those that fall under this trope are also extremely vulnerable to the wannabe diss, both from actual big bads and their enemies.

The early victory can show the badass in distress. Fans might feel a player punch if a sidekick comes to grief.

Contrast with team rocket wins. Compare with smug snake vs the chessmaster or magnificent bastard, eviler than thou, and disc one final boss. See also dragon-in-chief. Subtrope of paper tiger.
