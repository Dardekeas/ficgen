An evil character who does not eat meat.

For some Evil Vegetarians, vegetarianism might be explicitly connected to their villainy. These characters will usually be members of an animal wrongs group or might even be a straw vegetarian (meaning he takes his beliefs way too far).

For other Evil Vegetarians, vegetarianism might be mentioned but is not explicitly connected to their villainy. This might be done by the writer to highlight a contrast between the character's evil deeds and his refusal to harm animals.

The trope codifier is probably adolf hitler, though there is some controversy over whether or not he was actually a vegetarian . It is common for a character to say something along the lines of "I can't believe X is evil! He doesn't even eat meat!" only for another character to answer "neither did hitler."As eating meat is considered manly in many cultures, the Evil Vegetarian might be related to the sissy villain trope. Eating meat can also be seen as barbaric, so this might also overlap with wicked cultured. See also straight edge evil, hitler ate sugar.
