A situation where a big bad exists in the story arc, but his identity is not known until much later. This could be a result of the heroes going against the faceless, requiring only a look under the mask to understand everything. In most cases, this is an inversion of the hidden agenda villain, where we know that something bad is happening and the driving question is the one behind it all.

Usually a magnificent bastard post reveal. Compare the man behind the man, except without the first man. It can only overlap if the first man is obviously a disc one final boss.

If the Hidden Villain turns out to be a previously known antagonist, see hijacked by ganon. If it was someone who was never suspected at all, then the trope is the dog was the mastermind.
