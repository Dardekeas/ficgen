In fiction, most bad guys have a freudian excuse. Some may even go as far as having a start of darkness. Some, however, have neither. Or, at least, not a "good" one.

This trope occurs when the bad guy hits the good guys with the typical motive rant for their actions, and an observer dumbfoundedly proclaims, "THAT'S your reason?" with unabashed disgust or disappointment. To the bad guy, committing murder, cold-blooded torture, or any other heinous deeds or crimes based on that motive made sense, or at least, they saw it as a legitimate excuse. The heroes and others who find out the truth, however, are utterly disappointed not only that so much evil happened for such nonsensical reasons, but that this loser has had them running around expecting an epic battle of wills.

This isn't the same as for the evulz or it amused me. The character in question had a "reason", but as far as the good guys are concerned, it wasn't a very good one. Also, please no "heroic" examples of this trope. If the character isn't doing "bad" or immoral things, it doesn't count for this trope.

Compare and constrast with motive decay, where the initial motive was actually a good one (or at least made more sense) than what it ended up devolving into. Also compare tragic dream, where the motivation can be very valid, but is in no way reachable, as well as disproportionate retribution and comically small demand.

May overlap with evil is petty. See also anti-climactic unmasking, where the identity of the perpetrator is also disappointing.
