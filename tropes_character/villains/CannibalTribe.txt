Once upon a time, it was pretty much a given that any dark-skinned, non-christian native tribes encountered by a european explorer hero would be consumers of human flesh. The stereotypical Cannibal Tribe are always chaotic evil, dress in very little but for the skeletons in the coat closet, and live in wooden huts around a large fire with an enormous cooking pot sitting on top of it.

the missionary may be already there, trying to make them change their ways, or he might be in our hero's party... or those might be his bones adorning the chief's throne. monstrous cannibalism may be practiced within the tribe if they run out of captives.

Often provide the Angry Natives for a chased by angry natives scene. Contrast noble savage.

Subtrope of hollywood natives. Supertrope of captured by cannibals and the related exploitation film genre, cannibal film. Contrast with cannibal clan, where the cannibals are just a family. Subtrope of humans are bastards. And ironically, the cannibal tribe's attitude towards foreigners makes them a subtrope of politically incorrect villain.
