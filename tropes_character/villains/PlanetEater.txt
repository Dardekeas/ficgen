This is the way the world ends, not with a bang, but a nom (all apologies to t. s. eliot).

A character that not just destroys but eats planets for nourishment. They may suck the life-force from the biosphere, feed off its gravitic potential or magnetic field, or just start taking big bites out of the crust and mantle.

planet looters and alien locusts taken to the Nth degree. Taking this trope to the Nth degree, is spacetime eater. Compare omnicidal maniac and planetary parasite. This is an X-1 class threat in apocalypse how. When a character eats planet-sized portions (or eats so much they're the size of a planet) that's big eater.

this would have been called "world hunger", but that's a real life problem with real life consequences. we guess.
