Not just any wolf but the Big Bad Wolf. The one with the Three Little Pigs, or Little Red Riding Hood, or both.

When the Big Bad Wolf appears in works of fiction, there are usually some common themes included, such as his predatory nature, his knack for disguising himself (used to fool Little Red Riding Hood), and his powerful lungs (used to destroy the two of the Three Little Pigs' houses). Adult-oriented fairytale retellings since the seventies or so have developed a tradition in which he is often either a werewolf or a reverse werewolf (a wolf who turns into a human).

Since this character is a common target of alternate character interpretation: When adding an example, please specify how the Big Bad Wolf is portrayed.

The character is usual a savage wolf but please note that the character doesn't have to be a genuine wolf to fit this trope. Those are traditional characteristics of the character, but Alternate Character Interpretation can go quite far. Not to be confused with a big bad who's a wolf, though sometimes they are.
