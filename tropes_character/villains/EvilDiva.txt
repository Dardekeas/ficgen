There is this one pop singer, who recently became the biggest thing since television. She's beautiful and came out of nowhere all of the sudden. Oh, and her voice is so wonderful and clear and great and, and, and...Ah, let's just listen to her new single! ...Oh wait, how come I'm so tired suddenly? Why are the words "obey me" stuck in my head? I don't remem...oh, crap.

Congratulations, you encountered the Evil Diva! With her magical voice, microphone, instrument, etc, the Evil Diva becomes a rising star and draws all of the world's attention to herself and her "talent". Her songs may seem better to you than they actually are, hypnotizing you, turning you into the heartless, stealing your soul, or the like. She's also always female and usually a poster-child example of evil is sexy. She's a subtrope of the idol singer and may or may not overlap with the dark magical girl. As such, she has a tendency to pull a heel-face turn.

the hero may or may not be immune to the effects of her music. His/Her sidekicks or true companions are usually not. Her fighting style usually incorporates the power of rock, and her appearance usually signals a musical episode.

Compare magic idol singer, of which this is the evil counterpart.

Not to be confused with the webcomic Evil Diva.
