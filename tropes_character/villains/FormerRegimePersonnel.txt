When a large autocracy, particularly one with a major military force, changes government, you will find a lot of highly-trained people out of a job.

So, they frequently become hired guns. An aversion of full-circle revolution, where they may all get new jobs in the new regime like nothing had changed.

The former USSR and South Africa are good sources for them. Many members of the mafiya may be ex-Soviet military or ex-KGB, as many were let go without a pension. Note that before the great politics mess-up, it was kinda taboo among the mafiya to accept ex-military or ex-KGB people, but during the Nineties it all broke.

May or may not wear a commissar cap.

Contrast dangerous deserter.
