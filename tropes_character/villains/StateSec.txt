State Sec(urity) is a civilian agency or political entity that has its own paramilitary forces. It could be official or unofficial, but it exists to enforce an ideology or support the government. Its something akin to the secret police, but on steroids. Often the organization is on the side of evil, but this is not always the case.

The most powerful versions are autonomous from the regular government and military. They tend to be vast organizations - the secret agents and cloak and dagger stuff are but one subset. Other divisions can include a full-blown paramilitary division to keep the regular army in check and act as a regime protection force, a political and administrative division, a propaganda division, an R&D division, you name it. And to make sure State Security stays loyal, there could be an elite force within the organization to keep it in check.

The trope gets its name from the Honor Harrington book series, where state sec has its own Space Navy, space marines, Army, various intelligence organizations, etc... This was in turn inspired by the real life Schutzstaffel of nazi germany, which had the elite Waffen-SS which was pretty much a second German Army for the Nazi party, the Allgemeine-SS which ran the damn thing, and many more. A full list can be found at Wikipedia. Needless to say, this trope tends to coincide with putting on the reich a lot.

Also, it's very common in real life and has been seen throughout history. Political intrigues and favoritism can lead to interservice rivalry with the Regular Army. mega corp. and n.g.o. superpower are when corporate or other non-governmental entities wield similar levels of influence, infrastructure and paramilitary power.
