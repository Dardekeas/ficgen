A mentor once had a student, who used to be a good person, and perhaps the mentor's most promising and skilled student ever. That student had a flaw; a seed of villainy that needed a trigger. Usually, it was arrogance about his/her skills, or impatience at not being taught the final skills that the mentor had yet to teach. Then the student became a villain.

Sometimes the mentor is the protagonist and will have to take the student down in the story. More often, the protagonist is another student the mentor takes on. If that's the case then the other student is the mentor's new hope.

Compare deceptive disciple (when the student was evil the whole time, just pretending not to be), fallen hero, merlin and nimue, and the paragon always rebels.
