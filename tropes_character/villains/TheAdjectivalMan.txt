So, you've got a mysterious and strange character that needs a name...Oh, it's a male? No worries, then. Just slap an adjective in front the word "man", place a "the" in front of it all, and bravo! You have a name!

For some reason, these characters tend to almost always be villains with a hidden agenda, and, as can be inferred by the name of the trope, almost always male (though some cases might be better described as "male-ish"). There's something about the phrase "the _____ man" that just seems to appeal to people. Perhaps it's the right degree of familiarity mixed with strangeness? Or perhaps it brings up images of strange people we see often but don't know the names of? Or perhaps it's all just a great big coincidence? No matter the reason, there's just something primal about this wording.

Different from something person in that characters following this particular naming convention aren't superheroes, also there's the "the" in front of the name. Also different from the adjectival superhero, where the "the" and adjective are an optional addendum to the name. This trope is surprisingly prominent in sci-fi and horror stories, which may explain why most examples tend to be supernatural and/or antagonistic.

Compare everyone calls him barkeep. Not to be confused with the man.
