At first glance, he is the reasonable authority figure or maybe even a gentleman detective. However, if you push them too far in just the right place (may or may not be their berserk button), he will have a good reason to become an outcast from the police force and perform a face-heel turn. What makes this character ostracize himself from the law that he worked for varies exponentially; He has either heard bad news about his social life, a position that he worked so hard for is not as great as he thinks, or the directions that he works under put him under too much pressure.

It's usually a twist ending.

In a heist movie, a lawman pursues the villains, and once he catches or kills them, he realizes that he has nothing to go back to and decides to keep the loot for himself and start a new life.

If the lawman is not the hero of the story, then he might do a full face-heel turn. After helping the hero defeat the villains, he turns on the hero and tries to kill him so he can have the money for himself.

To put it bluntly, this character is what's known as a lawman gone bad. This is a character who takes pride in working for the law before an incident that makes him snap causes him to distance himself from those that he used to work for.

The character may also be a big bad friend.
