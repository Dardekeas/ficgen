A sister trope or sub-trope of pure is not good, this is when a villain lives a temperate and orderly lifestyle, free of drugs, tobacco, alcohol, illicit sex and other such vices. Such a villain will probably be lawful evil and keep to a schedule, complete with moderate exercise. Maybe you can trip them up by exploiting their dependence on a schedule, but that's a maybe. You're dealing with someone who truly understands moderation, and happens to be evil.

This could be a conscious choice, to keep their mind clear and free from distraction and addiction; it could also just be their natural temperament (making them a good contrast to a hot-blooded hero or any passionate protagonist).

Often a trait of a knight templar. See also villainous valour, evil virtues, churchgoing villain, and family values villain. Compare smug straight edge and even evil has standards.
