Long ago, an ancient people faced a terrible evil. Using various methods, they bound the evil into a prison from which they thought it could never escape.

It did.

Sealed Evil In A Can, as the title suggests, is a way to introduce a villain suddenly, especially one that is legendary and powerful. It also explains why the villain hasn't done anything up to that point: It just now escaped.

Sometimes, the big bad's plan is to unseal the can of some ancient god of evil; hoping they'll get some of that great power as a reward. If they succeed, it almost always turns out that the Sealed Evil was manipulating them into freeing them, making the Sealed Evil the true big bad. Sealed EvilÂ™ almost never rewards those who release it. It may act like the malevolent flavor of a jackass genie, twisting their releasers' wishes back on them, or it may simply decide that you have outlived your usefulness. Remember: evil is not a toy.

The hero occasionally breaks the seal himself due to lack of information or active manipulation by the villain.

Oddly enough, no matter what the cause of the seal being broken, it seems to always happen 1,000 years after the evil was first sealed. Yet nobody ever seems genre savvy enough to know that the big bad is about to reemerge in that time frame.

The primary question is usually "Why did they just seal it, as opposed to KILL it?" Well, the answer tends to vary; but usually it's a variant of the punishment (for both the sealed and everyone else), and/or as long as there is evil. Maybe it can't die (or more commonly, the conditions weren't right to deal the final blow), so sealing is the next best thing. Another common excuse is the balance between good and evil; if they'd killed the ancient evil, then a bigger, badder evil would've taken its place, thus sealing it away neutralizes the threat but also keeps it in the world and maintains the balance. For some reason, only on a very few occasions is the evil sealed simply because the goods didn't have the power at the time to kill it outright.

Expect the mere release of the SEIAC to cause a world-wrecking wave, walking wasteland, and sundry other disasters. That said, being cooped up for centuries is likely to have weakened the SEIAC, meaning it needs some time to recover its lost strength. This could mean that the hero(es) has a chance to seal it back up, or even destroy it once and for all.

Since this trope can be traced back to Greek mythology, it's older than feudalism. Notice that it is exactly the same, without the mystical magical mumbo-jumbo, as any plot where a horrible criminal escapes from or is released from prison.

This is an extremely common plot and backstory in video games because it's such a simple backstory: the big bad, put away by some ancient hero, has escaped. You (the player) must put him back in.
