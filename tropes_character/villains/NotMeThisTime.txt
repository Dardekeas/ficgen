In a series with a recurring big bad, it is sometimes the case that a side-villain or monster of the week is introduced to cause havoc and shake things up.

Of course, since this is a series with a recurring big bad, our heroes may feel perfectly justified in going after the usual suspects. This trope refers to such scenes, in which our regular villain is forced to inform the protagonists that this installment's plot is not his or her doing. This may or may not be believed at first, but after the villain's innocence is established, expect him to curtly dismiss the heroes.

Traditional truce zone requirements mandate that regardless of all the crimes they committed yesterday, if caught for the wrong thing today; the heroes have to let them go. Either that or the big bad got off on a technicality for yesterday's crimes.

This trope can be chalked up to the law of conservation of detail: if you're going to have your villain appear, it might as well be relevant to the plot at hand.

This trope may also occur with any character who has a recurring habit. May or may not lead to evil versus evil or enemy mine, depending on the story. (A villain might be upset that he was blamed for something he didn't do, or that he's being pounded on by the hero for something he didn't do, or that he was accused of a crime he considers beneath him, or that somebody else claimed a triumph he would have liked to score for himself. Any of these reasons is enough for him to be pissed at the guy who really did it.)

Also see villains out shopping, which might explain the villain's innocence. Compare motive misidentification, where the big bad is responsible, but for different reasons than the heroes initially suspect. Contrast hijacked by ganon, where it seems like a new villain is at fault but the big bad is revealed to be pulling the strings.
