You ever watch a show with a conflict that suddenly gets derailed by a relatively minor or previously unseen character who suddenly becomes the big bad and derails the conflict you were previously enjoying? That new villain is the Conflict Killer. They come in and replace the existing plot with a completely new conflict, often by causing the hero and previous villain to put aside their differences and face the new threat, earning a new respect for each other and frequently never getting back to the conflict we were watching in the first place. this isn't necessarily negative, however, as sometimes a conflict killer is a magnificent bastard who takes the work to another level.

Distinct from the man behind the man because this villain was either heretofore a minor player or had no previous role in the story.

Occasionally overlaps with the worf effect when the new villain shows off their might and the sorting algorithm of evil when the Conflict Killer is clearly more powerful than the previous villain. Sometimes the new villain is conveniently black in terms of evil, as opposed to merely gray like the previous villain, and kills the previous villain off.Compare plot tumor and they wasted a perfectly good plot. If this happens in a video game it may result in a bait-and-switch boss, but only if said boss is driving the plot. Contrast the giant space flea from nowhere that appears with no explanation. If the mystery surrounding him and/or the existing players' ignorance of him are plot points, this is outside-context villain instead. This is a spoiler heavy trope, so read on at your own risk.
