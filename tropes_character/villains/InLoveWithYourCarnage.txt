This is where the villain or a morally ambiguous character becomes obsessed with a character due to their witnessing said character go berserk and kill in a very messy or bloody way. Many times, there will be scenes where the villain will be somewhere watching the character fight violently and appear extremely turned on, saying something along the lines of "Marvellous..." If the protagonist is no longer violent like that, often the villain will go to great lengths to make them revert back (these lengths normally involve kidnapping or killing their friends or love interests.)

If the villain / morally ambiguous character starts straight-out describing their euphoric emotions when they saw the good character massacre others, expect the good character to be very disturbed and/or confused.

This can lead to the villain becoming a stalker with a crush. Compare hemo erotic and monster fangirl. May leads to lots of foe yay or no yay.
