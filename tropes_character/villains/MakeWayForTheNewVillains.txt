A subtrope of evil versus evil, this is for when a previous villain, whether a significant or minor one, is made significantly less of a threat (or in some cases outright killed) with the help of the next villain. The previous villain is put aside, to make way for the new villains.

This often implies that the new villain is more competent, more evil, or for whatever other reason more threatening, but not necessarily. Cases where the new villain is less threatening instead can qualify as this trope, too. May be the result of big damn villains.

Compare always a bigger fish, which sometimes overlaps with this but not always and sorting algorithm of evil, and bait-and-switch boss. Also the worf effect, depending on how they take them out. In video games, this is often the true final boss.
