You've all heard of monstrous mimes and creepy clowns. Well, rounding out the Trilogy of Horror vaudeville-any is the demonic dummy, otherwise known as the evil ventriloquist's doll.

A ventriloquist is, as you probably already know, an entertainer who tries to convince an audience that a non-living thing (in most cases, a puppet) is alive and talking. Now this act, though odd, probably wouldn't be too offputting an entertainment — except that nine times out of ten, when a ventriloquist's puppet appears in a series or movie, it will be a hideous, dwarven creature who crawled straight out of the uncanny valley. With its jutting eyebrows, shifting eyes and its sharp, mechanical rictus of a smile, the demonic dummy occupies a prominent place in the darker recesses of the human subconscious — it is nitro-burning Nightmare Fuel for viewers both young and old.

One of the most common twists in a story which features a Demonic Dummy, is to have the dummy be real, and the ventriloquist either be a wooden puppet or a hapless human under the dummy's control — in fact, many Demonic Dummies get the ability to turn people into people puppets, sometimes literally. Another twist is to have both the ventriloquist and the dummy be two parts of a split personality (with the human being the shy and nebbish part of the personality, and the dummy the loud and abrasive half). Other variations of the dummy/ventriloquist relationship exist as well, as you'll see below...

Also, note that other types of puppet aren't safe either. Classical-style ventriloquist dummies are the most popular, but anything from a sock puppet on up can fall into this category.
