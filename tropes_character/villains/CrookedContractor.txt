A small household crisis, like a faulty pipe or a leaky roof is likely to hit everyone at some point, and when it does, someone profits from it.

The crooked contractor comes in two flavors, the Criminally Lazy and the Plain Criminal. The criminally lazy is paid an hourly wage, shows up late — if at all — and doesn't exactly rush the job. The plain criminal flavor includes scammers who e.g. "inspect the roof" and leave behind holes so large you have to hire them to fix them. There's occasionally also a third flavor in the form of "dude who bit off more than they could chew" - this is what happens when contractors who are inexperienced or who specialize in one field but are trying to learn the ropes of another take a job that's well beyond what they're capable of. The difference between the two is that the well-intentioned ones will generally own up to their mistakes (that's not to say that weasels don't exist), while the crooks will disappear and leave you with an uncollectable judgment if you manage to sue them.
