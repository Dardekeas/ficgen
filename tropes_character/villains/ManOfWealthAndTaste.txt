A subtrope of evil is cool: basically, if there's a deliciously evil male villain, he's going to be a well-dressed villain. He'll wear a sharp-looking suit. Silk tie, expensive shirt, exquisitely ironed pants, tailored jacket, leather belt and tasteful accessories. Always perfectly in fashion. Bonus points if it's a monochrome suit, and extra-special bonus points if it's a black monochrome suit.

Turns out, evil has quite a lot of money and excellent fashion sense. The villain might well brag about the kickass English or Italian suit he had tailored, possibly during a mob boss suit fitting. Very common for the corrupt corporate executive.

When your evil mook uniforms are made by Hugo Boss, this is putting on the reich.

sub-trope of sharp-dressed man, and sister trope to badass in a nice suit, and man in white.

See also wicked cultured, and a glass of chianti. The polar opposite of wild man â€” a hero with no resources, no fashion, but a very good heart. The other polar opposite is fashion-victim villain.

Not to be confused with louis cypher, who resembles the trope namer in a different way.
