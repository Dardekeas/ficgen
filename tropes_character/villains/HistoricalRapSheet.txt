The crimes of the villain(s) date back long before our grandfathers were born. Historical events that hurt many people are attributed to a single organization or person, usually more than one. Even if there isn't technically a law against causing earthquakes or eruptions, the events are used to show how dangerous the criminal is by placing wars, economic struggles, assassinations, and other pivotal events in their past. stock unsolved mysteries are particularly useful for this.

These crimes can be committed by a group, like the ancient conspiracy, or a single person, like we didn't start the f√ºhrer. Those tropes cover the actual villains, this trope is about the "crimes".

Note that this doesn't necessarily have to apply to a villain: i.e. an idiot hero reality warper could've caused a natural disaster through clumsiness.

Subtrope of historical in-joke, and essentially the evil twin of been there, shaped history. Compare beethoven was an alien spy, julius beethoven da vinci and historical villain upgrade. Often a form of list of transgressions or offstage villainy.
