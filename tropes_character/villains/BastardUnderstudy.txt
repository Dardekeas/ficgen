The big bad has an assistant or sidekick to whom they spend a lot of time bragging to about just how clever they are. Near the end, their assistant double crosses them spectacularly while their back is turned. Essentially, this is deceptive disciple, except that the Bastard Understudy is apprenticed to an evil mentor.

In many cases the Bastard Understudy appears to have been groomed as a successor of sorts. While the big bad hates the idea of defeat, they know they are not going to live forever, and the Bastard Understudy offers a continuation of their legacy. A sublime game of xanatos speed chess keeps the Bastard Understudy just out of reach of the power... until the last play.

the starscream is a visible rival who lacks the Bastard Understudy's loyalty and patience. the dog bites back is when the betrayal is not premeditated. May be a form of thanatos gambit. See magnificent bastard, manipulative bastard, villain takes an interest, and the chessmaster for characters who are likely to have one of these around. May overlap with dragon with an agenda. Definitely overlaps with rule of two.

Spoilers Ahead!
