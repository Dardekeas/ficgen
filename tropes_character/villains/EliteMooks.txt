When the enemies are too easily taken down by the heroes and there is a need to increase the challenge, the easiest way to is to upgrade the mooks into Elite Mooks. They may come with better weapons, additional skills, or various powers the normal mooks do not possess. The look of the Elite Mooks may be noted with various appearance changes from a simple palette swap, adding spikes of villainy, and other cosmetic alterations that make them stand out from the crowd of regular mooks.

Any variety of mooks can be upgraded to become an Elite Mook, which can yield a boss in mook clothing or super powered mooks. mooks can be transformed into cyborgs, Zombies or elite zombies if they already zombies, made into super soldiers, or upgraded in other various ways.

Not to be confused with the generally solitary giant mook, the heavily armored mook or the surprisingly elite cannon fodder. Contrast the king mook, which is a boss version of a typical Mook, and the mook lieutenant, which is a higher ranking mook, who doesn't need to be a Elite Mook for to become one.
