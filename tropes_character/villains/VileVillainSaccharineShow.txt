Okay, so you have a villain who is legitimately intimidating and frightening. Maybe they try to destroy all positive emotions, or maybe they turn people into twisted shambling abominations, or maybe they're plotting genocide. Point is, they're actually a fairly creepy villain. The irony is that they're stuck in a sugar bowl.

As one could probably tell, this trope is about villains in normally lighthearted fiction that are so disturbing, or even terrifying, on some level that they kind of clash with the tone of the show/game/whatever. Because of this type of villain's ability to ruin the mood of the story they're in, this trope can overlap with knight of cerebus or complete monster. If a series has a lot of villains like this, then it's taking a ride on the cerebus rollercoaster.

A violation of genre consistency. Compare and contrast the crapsaccharine world, where it's not just the villain, but the entire world that is rotten to the core. A major cause of sugar apocalypse and surprise creepy.
