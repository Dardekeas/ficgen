losing a child is the worst nightmare of many parents. Creators play into this fear by creating characters that steal children for a living. aliens, evil elves/fairies, goblins and other inhuman creatures are notorious for this. If a human does this, chances are they're a very special kind of evil character, because children are innocent.

There are many possible motivations for this. Perhaps the abductors have technology that's powered by a forsaken child. Maybe their god demands sacrifice. It could be that they need child soldiers or slaves. Maybe they want a child of their own. Or maybe they just think that kids are delicious.

For a specific variation that involves abduction by fairy beings, see changeling tale. See also alien abduction, eats babies, childless dystopia.
