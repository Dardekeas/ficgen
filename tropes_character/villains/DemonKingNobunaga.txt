According to the Jesuit Father Luis Frois, oda nobunaga called himself "demon king of the sixth heaven" (dairokuten-maō), a title properly belonging to Māra, the Buddhist counterpart of satan (though portrayed in mythology as a noble demon). While Nobunaga was most likely being sarcastic, and in any case he's not the only daimyō of the Sengoku Jidai whose ruthlessness has inspired a historical villain upgrade, many popular depictions of Nobunaga literally demonize him, or at least give him supernatural powers.
