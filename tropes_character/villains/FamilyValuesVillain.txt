Some villains have standards. They might have no problem gunning cops down in cold blood, but they aren't going to do anything to children. Or they might be willing to blow up a city for a holy cause, but not for money. Somewhere they have to draw the line - because, if that line doesn't exist, good and evil cease to have any meaning at all.

And for a handful of villains, that line is, "Anything the brady kids learned an aesop about." Yes, these are bad guys who believe in good old fashioned family values. Being a kingpin in the international drug trade might be fine, but giving alcohol to minors, most certainly not! It's their duty as a loyal citizen to show respect and admiration for the local police, but nothing says they can't do that and bribe the cops into murdering their enemies. and, of course, sexual intercourse outside of marriage is strictly prohibited ... unless it's non-consensual, then they can just go wild.

Not all examples of this trope are as self-contradictory as the ones above, though. In some cases, promoting family values may be the reason the villain is doing all these horrible things, making them a knight templar. And in other cases, the family (wo)man routine might simply be an act, designed to ensure that they remain a villain with good publicity. A third case might be that they display acute symptoms of moral myopia, putting "family" and "everyone else" into two completely different categories as far as the standards of moral behavior are concerned.

But then again, some just don't seem to see anything odd about speaking an arcane ritual to summon horrific demons into the mortal plane, then lecture some kids about saying "darn" instead of "damn." Needless to say, the trope carries its own dose of unfortunate implications, especially in a society that is still learning to accept non traditional gender roles and relationships. When used badly, it could lead to the conclusion that supporting family values is a bad thing. Unless that is the author's actual intention.

Compare straight edge evil, evil virtues, and churchgoing villain. Contrast with moral dissonance or values dissonance, where an ostensibly family-friendly character can unintentionally appear villainous to some.
