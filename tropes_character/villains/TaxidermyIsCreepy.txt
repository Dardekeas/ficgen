So you're moving into a new place, taking a break between boxes to meet the neighbors. The guy from Apartment 4 down the hall seems nice enough, but for some reason you can't quite put your finger on, you feel there's something off about him. Maybe it's the glassy-eyed menagerie of stuffed animals he keeps in his study. Or the fact that he prepared all of them himself, including his late dog.

This trope is when taxidermy is portrayed as an innocuous yet somehow sinister hobby that provides a handy shortcut for writers looking to establish a character as strange or unnerving. The taxidermy-enthusiast isn't necessarily evil, per se, but this hobby doesn't help to assuage anyone's fears.

Subtrope of pastimes prove personality. See also taxidermy terror. See uncanny valley for one of the main reasons many people find taxidermy creepy.
