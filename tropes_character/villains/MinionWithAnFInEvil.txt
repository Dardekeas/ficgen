No, he doesn't kick himself by accident when trying to kick the dog. He's a henchman to a card-carrying villain who can't quite wrap his mind around card-carrying villainy. As such, they often get confused and do "good" things like saying please or thank you or being kind to the heroes in some way by mistake â€” and get yelled at for it by their superior if caught. This character type tends to be predicated on the assumption that rousseau was right; theoretically, this so-called "villain" hasn't properly learned how to be bad. Very much played for laughs, and most commonly used in children's shows. They often get a mook-face turn at the end of the series, or earlier if their boss is particularly mean with a mistreatment-induced betrayal. They may also get a the dog bites back moment to go along with it.

Not to be confused with affably evil characters, who are evil but polite about it. Certain versions are relatives who the villain is obliged to keep around despite their incompetence, or horrific monsters that turn out to actually be gentle giants.

Contrast harmless villain, worthy opponent, punch clock villain, reluctant monster, and obliviously evil. See also surrounded by idiots, token good teammate, poke the poodle, white sheep, merciful minion, and good all along. Compare and contrast with hero with an f in good. Frequently hold back a truly terrifying boss due to the conservation of competence.
