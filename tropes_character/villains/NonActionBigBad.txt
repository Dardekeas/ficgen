The big bad, as everybody knows, is the ultimate evil in a work of fiction (or not). But, what exactly makes him such a threatening villain? Is it because they're cunning? eviler than anybody else? Or maybe because they're powerful? In practically every work of fiction centered around action, the latter is the case. Well, not always.

Enter the Non-Action Big Bad, which is evil counterpart of non-action guy.

This guy has zero fighting skills. He isn't interested in becoming stronger or more powerful either, but probably has a lust for conquest or something similar and will rely on a second-in-command or a quirky miniboss squad to do all of the dirty work that needs to get done. Compare the man behind the curtain. In a video game, they may be the unfought. For big bads who have power, but act like this until the climax, see orcus on his throne.

Compare dragon-in-chief, where the dragon serves as the de-facto big bad for the story, though not neccesarily because of this trope. Also compare orcus on his throne, where the big bad may be skilled and powerful, but doesn't even carry out any plans beyond sitting around being generally evil. If encountered in a video game, this character will either act as a deliberate anti-climax boss, or an outright zero-effort boss.
