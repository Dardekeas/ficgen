The third, final, and most despicable trope in the unholy trinity of villainous objectives, Dystopia Justifies The Means is where the goal of the big bad is nothing less than the deliberate creation of a dystopia, a land, planet, universe or multiverse of perpetual misery and suffering, or some other form of evil. The result can be a crapsack world, villain world, hell on earth, or some combination thereof.

The villains out to achieve this usually have flown well beyond the moral event horizon long ago. justified for villains made of evil, like The First in the buffyverse, as they actually feed on the world's malice and misery. Most demon lords, eldritch abominations, gods of evil, evil cosmic entities, and villains defined by doing evil only for the sake of evil itself will probably pursue this goal, come to think of it.

This trope can occasionally overlap with utopia justifies the means; in such cases, the deluded villain has an idea of a "better" world that the majority regard as nightmare fuel. In general, however, this trope refers to characters who wish to create a dystopia and have no illusions or expectations that people will be happier or better off under it, and in fact would absolutely enjoy it if people are neither happy nor better off under it.

Compare with despotism justifies the means, which depicts the dystopia as a mere side effect, not as an end in itself. The type of villain pursuing Dystopia Justifies The Means will not be satisfied just with obtaining ultimate power; they will desire to use that power towards a particularly vile end - to remake the world into a place of suffering for its own sake.
