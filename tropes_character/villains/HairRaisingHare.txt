Ah, rabbits. Who could possibly think of a more cute, cuddly, and harmless creature? With their wriggling noses, comically long ears, and fuzzy little tails, they're just so adorable!

Except, of course, when they aren't.

Twisting the easily-recognized and almost universally-beloved form of the rabbit into something terrifying is a common type of subverted cuteness, because we all have the expectation of rabbits as sweet and innocent. Sometimes this is done by making the rabbit carnivorous or otherwise extremely dangerous, but just making it look or act scary is enough to have it fall into this trope. Also, anything that plays the rabbit for horror falls in this trope, which means that stuffed animals and people in costumes all apply.

Of course, in real life, rabbits aren't always harmless. Ask any Australian about the devastation they've caused to crops and local wildlife. Indeed, many times if there's a problem with animal overpopulation, it's usually rabbits, and too many rabbits can quickly become a nightmare of its own. Plus, any animal with huge buck teeth is bound to have a nasty bite, regardless of diet.
