So, you've got a super soldier program, perhaps an AI research initiative, an organization that has access to all sorts of phlebotinum goodness for its operatives, or some other cutting edge experiment designed to alter or create life.

One small problem. The first test subject, AI, or robot off the assembly line isn't just a super prototype, it's completely insane.Maybe the streams crossed, the super serum is actually of the psycho or toxic flavors, the janitor tossed rotten tomatoes at it, the psych evaluations weren't as rigorous as they should have been, or an honest to goodness unforeseen complication happened during Alpha Testing (if there was any, that is). Whatever the case, the experiment has gone horribly wrong and the first and eldest of a nascent chosen many has gone rogue (and not in the good way), is evil, and likely wants to kill its makers and younger siblings.

More chillingly, it is the result of an experiment that has gone horribly right. The prototype is so powerful and so good at what it does that its makers cannot control or influence it. Its going to do whatever it wants, often violently.

This tends to happen very frequently to projects started by altogether good conspiracies who want to create an army of heroes. By the time they get around to perfecting the process and the hero undergoes it, "big brother" will show up and either "offer" to form a secret project refugee family after killing their "parents"... or kill him dead if he refuses. Inevitably, any previous version of a hero who reappears is invariably evil.

Expect this monster to be named some variation of Alpha, Proto, or zero.Contrast evil knockoff, no plans, no prototype, no backup. Parent Trope of beta test baddie. See also flawed prototype.
