So you've created your ultimate weapon of terror/fortress of doom/super secret thing. One problem, somebody had to build/design this thing. What happens if he talks or grows a conscience? Simple solution: have them all killed! Your secrets will be safe and he can't build another one for any rivals.

Of course, you have to hope there are no plans, no prototype, no backup to ruin your scheme...

Subtrope of you have outlived your usefulness.
