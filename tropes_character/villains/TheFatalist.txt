the fatalist is exactly what it says on the tin: a character who believes everything that happens is destined to happen and there is no way to escape it. They probably spend a lot of time telling the determinator that you can't fight fate and to know when to fold 'em - in vain.

Sometimes they keep this attitude to the end, but sometimes they change once somebody proves to them that they can screw destiny.

And yes, the root here is referring to "fate" not "fatal" but don't think about it too hard.When using these kinds of people as villains, expect some overlap with straw nihilist (they in particular tend to combine this with finagle's law and cosmic horror story). There are however heroic versions of this, especially if they are accepting that fate may be demanding a heroic sacrifice from them.
