Next to deep voices, this is the most common auditory clue to an evil character. Raspy voices are very popular as a vocal choice for evil characters, especially evil old folks.

Compared to deep voices, raspy voices have less of an intimidating effect but more of a sinister tone. This makes it particularly effective for the big bad of a show, especially when juxtaposed with a deep voice of his dragon. A rasp is also good for a particularly creepy evil laugh. Sometimes, this trope overlaps with red right hand, when the rasp is caused by a physical defect or injury, usually to the throat or otherwise to a respiratory organ. This can occur hand in hand with vader breath, if the character is raspy because of smoking or a physical ailment.
