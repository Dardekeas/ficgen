A comedic version of the recurring boss, the Goldfish Poop Gang are characters who keep popping up, requiring you to fight them multiple times through the game. They quickly devolve from being actual threats to pesky nuisances, something the party may comment on.

The party (and developers) may take a shine to them, and you won't actually be allowed to kill them off in the end.

The trope name comes from the Japanese idiomatic phrase kingyo no fun, which literally means "goldfish crap" but idiomatically means a sycophant or hanger-on. That's because goldfish poop has a tendency to stick to the goldfish. So it's vaguely loathsome stuff that follows the fish around, just like a Goldfish Poop Gang.

May overlap with recurring quirky miniboss squads if they're not treated seriously. Frequently overlaps with being an ineffectual sympathetic villain or harmless villain. May also fill the shoes of the unknown rival, explaining why they keep coming back to annoy the party. Occasionally made a threat with team rocket wins. In Anime they're often a terrible trio.
