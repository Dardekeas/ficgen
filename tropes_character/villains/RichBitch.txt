Snide, contemptuous and ever-so-superior to coworkers or neighbors, the rich bitch is the character you love to hate. She has social position and/or money, and never lets anyone around her forget it; and if she can make you feel like dirt, she'll do it just to amuse herself. She can be especially vicious to men pursuing her who are not up to her sometimes impossible standards. Too much money has made them evil.

Sometimes the Rich Bitch actually has a heart of gold, and her behavior is either habit or a defense mechanism, but this subspecies is rare. Most of the time they're just jewel-encrusted sadists. If there is a country mouse in the cast, the Rich Bitch usually reserves the worst of her abuse for her.

Rich Bitch is what the alpha bitch and the spoiled brat often become when they grow up, and their motto is "screw the rules, i have money!" Compare gold digger, grande dame. Contrast spoiled sweet, uncle pennybags, mock millionaire and the ojou. Can be truth in television, as the page quote illustrates.

A sub-trope of idle rich.
