Anarchism is an umbrella term for a bunch of views that advocate the reduction or elimination of hierarchic power and its replacement by various forms of voluntary non-hierarchical cooperation. Historically, the majority of anarchists encourage nonviolent means for this goal.

Since the 19th century, after anarchism began to take form as a social movement, news, propaganda, and fiction have vilified anarchists as maniacs who just want nothing but chaos, destruction, and anarchy. Anarchists often fill the role of terrorists without a cause. This also tended to be the stereotypical image of communists for many Westerners until the "orwellian intellectual infiltrating the government" image gained popularity starting in the 1940s.

The "bomb-throwing" image of the anarchist was locked into the mindset of the public after the 1886 Haymarket Square riot in Chicago, where eight anarchists went on trial for a bomb that was thrown at a rally (they were not actually charged with throwing it, as some weren't even at the rally, instead they were charged with inciting the action, being influential anarchist figures in Chicago). Most people had probably never paid much attention to one of the 19th century's many radical social movements before, but the sensationalized spread of the incident left a negative impression in media for a long time. The assassination of several heads of governments by anarchists during the following twenty years didn't help them either.
