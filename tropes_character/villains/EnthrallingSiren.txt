Sirens are enthralling creatures who lure victims to them through supernatural means. They lure these people to their doom, though not necessarily immediate death. In some versions their powers only work on men. This detail is somewhat newer than they think (for example, Princess Ariadne is killed by sirens in some versions of the myth.)

They have enthralling voices, while their appearance ranges from very attractive, to very attractive after you've been at sea for a long time, to glamour or mind control covering up a very unsavory reality. If they'll actually change their form to something ideally perfect in the eyes of their victims or at least project a vision of the same, they'll either have some form of glamour or be a shapeshifting seducer. The method they typically also use is mind-control music.

They are at least humanoid, though the lower half is flexible. In classical mythology, sirens were bird-women, split about the same as a centaur. In most modern depictions of sirens the bird characteristics will be dropped and they'll be just beautiful women with beautiful voices, if they aren't mermaids, as bird-women nowadays are usually harpies.
