This is a common pairing of bad guys constructed along the same lines as a freudian trio, except for one important factor: They left off the reasonable character. In the classic the dragon pairing, for example, the Evil Overlord is very Superego-ish, who is wanting a maximum amount of rule and control, and the Dragon, who basically just wants to fight, is very Id-ish. The lesson being that without the moderation of the Ego, things can get really out of hand.

Subtrope of foil.
