A villain who is so terrifyingly powerful that he strikes fear into the hearts of the characters. Whenever he shows up, they are in true danger of character death and the best they can do is run as fast as they can. Unfortunately for them, he tends to succeed in catching them which results in defeat at best or death at worst.

A Subtrope of the dreaded, with the proviso that Hero Killers like to get their hands dirty. When a Hero Killer tracks down a main character, a no-holds-barred beatdown or a curb-stomp battle will ensue. If the hero decides that he's tired of running, it provides evidence that he's taken a level in badass. If the hero wins the fight, or gives the Hero Killer a run for his money, it may be a moment of awesome. Many series will have the hero(es) train or improve their skill throughout the story, fleeing or avoiding the Hero Killer until such point as the hero is finally ready to face him.

Such a character will use the worf effect to demonstrate exactly how powerful he is. He invokes anyone can die by his mere presence, stripping away characters' plot armor. This tends to overlap with implacable man for relentlessly hunting the hero. If he becomes too much of a good thing and crosses the line into author wish-fulfillment, he becomes a villain sue.

If the series was fairly lighthearted before this guy appeared, then he overlaps with knight of cerebus. Compare don't ask, just run, which can be the reaction to either this or to a non-character situation. He is very often the Goliath in a david versus goliath scenario. For a video game example to be a Hero Killer, it must be part of the story; contrast with that one boss, where this feeling is invoked via gameplay because the player keeps losing.

Keep in mind that a character doesn't qualify for this trope because they happened to kill one or two heroes. They have to be feared for their ability to do this. Remember, this is a Subtrope of the dreaded.
