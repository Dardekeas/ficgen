as the name indicates, this is a person who inflicts domestic abuse. This trope covers abusive partners of both genders, and the abuse they may dish out can be either mental, sexual, verbal, physical, financial, or emotional. The abuser puts the "destructive" in destructive romance.

It often invokes a rather nasty double standard, as the major part of the abusers in media will be male, and women will rarely be portrayed other than as victims. Where the double standard is reversed, on the other hand, you get double standard: abuse, female on male.

If the Domestic Abuser is played to be erotic, then they're a bastard boyfriend or girlfriend. Any character who reacts less than favourably to such an abuser is a wife-basher basher.

Sometimes part of a big screwed-up family. Compare abusive parents. Also loving bully, the much lighter and softer version. Sadly, of course, this is truth in television. you are not alone. More specific information and ways to seek help can be found at abuse.
