A trope about that most revered and respected of all professions, the debt collector. They have a proud reputation for being nasty, lazy thugs who think the law is a suggestion and will stoop to any low in order to shake some money out of their "customers." Their stereotypical nature is often the butt of many jokes. Note that for the sake of examples, tax collectors are also included. Prone to making the harassing phone call, as mentioned above. Some collectors in real life have even tried to get their targets arrested/imprisoned, even in areas where this is technically highly illegal (e.g. debt itself is not a criminal offense, but the debt collectors file a frivolous lawsuit, not notify the person they are collecting from of said suit, then have them jailed for contempt of court when they skip a court date they have no idea existed). The most common alignment for this trope is neutral evil.

This is one of the tropes that gave birth to dastardly whiplash.
