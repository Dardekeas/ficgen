Although nazi germany and individuals affiliated with the Nazi regime are typically cast as villains (and for good reason), there are occasional works of fiction where a Nazi, or a person who is associated with the Nazi-era German government or military, is the protagonist, rather than an antagonist. On occasion, the character in question is not a villain protagonist â€” mostly because they're a Nazi in name only, and react to their more objectionable orders by bothering by the book or actively fighting from the inside.

Be careful though, not all germans are nazis.
