It's human nature to want to get even with someone who hurt you. It's also human nature to want to reward someone who did something nice for you.

And sometimes, you want to make restitution for something that you did to someone else that hurt them. The tricky part is making the restitution proportionate to the injury. If you step on someone's toe, most people would consider an apology sufficient. If you were feeling particularly bad about it, maybe you'd offer to pay for a shoeshine for them.

But if you're writing fiction, and you want comedy, going the Disproportionate Restitution route is a old standby. That's making the restitution far less than the offense merits.

It often results in a speech along the lines of "I know I framed you for murder, set your car on fire, killed your dog, and when you asked what evidence I had that you'd been a neo-Nazi, I just laughed and said, 'Evidence-schmevidence'. But I want to make it up to you. So I got you a t-shirt."

If it's not played for comedy, it's used to underline just how much of a self-centered rat-bastard the character offering it is; he (or she) expects that any gesture of apology should be sufficient because THEY are the person offering it.

Compare disproportionate reward.
