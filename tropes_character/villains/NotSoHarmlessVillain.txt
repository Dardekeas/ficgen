Okay, so you have a villain, and, for whatever reason, you do not take them seriously. You might not even think about them at all. They might have a lame gimmick, or a weird name, or maybe they just do not stand out among the mooks. They are not exactly on your radar. Even if you do remember them, you think they are either a nobody or a total joke.

Then along comes a life changing event (and an editorial decision) when they will just not stand for it anymore. Some of them just... snap. Others put themselves through training from hell. Either way the villain reinvents themselves from the bottom up, into someone who is not only able to show the heroes exactly why they are called their enemy, but often even become the big bad or the man behind the man. This is when a villain decides to become their own sorting algorithm of evil.

Should they fail to do so, they will become a big bad wannabe.

Often the result of a darker and edgier reinvention of a franchise.

Compare from nobody to nightmare and beware the silly ones. breakout villains are prone to becoming Not So Harmless. Contrast villain decay and boisterous weakling. When applied to minor heroes instead of minor villains, it's let's get dangerous. See also team rocket wins.

Possible inherent spoilers ahoy, so read at your own risk.
