An ensemble of elite mooks more developed than faceless mooks but not as developed as the five-bad band. Occasionally the dragon or other major villain is part of the team, and will be the official or unofficial leader. The competency of this group varies wildly.

This group is typified by an overarching design theme, but also an individual quirky personality to each which may seem oddly familiar. They are allowed to act funnier than the dragon. They mainly provide a distraction to the heroes until the real plot kicks in. The big bad has little qualms with killing them off if they fail consistently, possibly because their jobs often entail a bare minimum of intelligence needed. Some groups are filled with backbiting and betrayal, with the occasional minionshipping. Occasionally, one or two of the bunch will have a change of heart, and do a heel-face turn. That person is almost always a loner to the rest of the group anyway, especially if they become the sixth ranger.

If the heroes defeat their dragon and their big bad, some or all of them may survive. They usually don't stick around in-show after that, but if they do, they may become the terrible trio or a bunch of sixth rangers.

See also terrible trio (incompetent Quirky Miniboss Squad, althought may be made a threat with team rocket wins), goldfish poop gang (a sillier recurring enemy independent of the big bad), and standard evil organization squad (a larger and more serious version). Contrast co-dragons for a situation where multiple characters split the Dragon role, but don't necessarily work together the way a quirky miniboss squad would and are usually treated more seriously.

Contrast the family for the whole family.
