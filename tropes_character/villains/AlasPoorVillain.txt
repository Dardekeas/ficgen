So, there's a villain. Right. Murdering, world-conquering type. The series is ending, so it's time to get rid of him. slowly and painfully. So he goes out with... a final touching quote and a one-woman wail?

As odd as it may seem, if you want the audience to feel sorry for a villain, a good death scene is probably the way to go. This works best if you know their freudian excuse; chaotic stupid need not apply for this sort of thing. Also works best if this is a supporting villain. This is easiest to do with a big bad's minions: we can identify with the dragon, and especially the quirky miniboss squad, over time and may be sad to see them go. If a fallen hero dies, expect everyone to weep openly. A few well-chosen last words may also be used to create this feeling.

Note that if you want the audience to take the scene seriously then it helps to add some humanizing elements to your villain beforehand. See likable villain for ways in which this can be done. Neglecting to do this may result in Narm or just confuse the audience.

Compare draco in leather pants, cry for the devil, what a senseless waste of human life, antagonist in mourning, and death equals redemption. See monster sob story when the villain's death isn't required to garner sympathy. Do not confuse with alas, poor scrappy. Or alas, poor yorick for that matter.
