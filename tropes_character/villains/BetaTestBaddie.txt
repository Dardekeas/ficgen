A villain whose main, often hidden, motivation is that he feels incomplete. This character is ashamed or enraged at the thought that he was seen as obsolete or surpassed by someone in front of him. This can be anything from a teacher who found a new student to a scientist who builds a "better" android, and is a common tragic fate for a replacement goldfish.

In the android/clone/other doppelganger scenario, the typical reason for this assumption is that the character lacks some vital component to be truly great or human, and might even be considered dangerous because of the lack. The typical subversion is that the original was too willful and independent, and subsequent models were made much more compliant.

If this "second model" is one of the heroes, the original's feelings may grow into an obsession with beating the newcomer and proving he's the best. The most humiliating defeat he can have is usually being shown that he was an ineffectual loner.

This kind of character is often the resenter.

Not to be confused with a dummied out mook in a video game.
