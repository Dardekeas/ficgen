In many works, especially anime and video games, white hair quite frequently indicates a villain or, at the very least, someone to watch out for. Especially in characters typically too young to have white hair.

Despite the wide range and use of hair colors for characters, there's an eerie specificity to the use of white/silver hair when coupled with a pale, handsome, vaguely effeminate face. The (usually long and rarely tied back) white hair is very frequently coupled with red eyes, and often with a dark outfit for contrast.

Compare with blond guys are evil, blondes are evil, evil albino and light is not good. Compare and contrast with someone who has mystical white hair, who is less likely to be evil and more likely to be magical, superpowered or otherworldly.
