So you've got a villain and you've got to give him a red right hand, and your protagonist is the manliest of men. So, why not make your villain a foil and remove his male organ? Especially prevalent in fantasy, the Evil Eunuch is simultaneously creepy and effeminate, which makes him an obvious villain. Eunuchs are also more snakelike. A subtrope of sissy villain. Eunuchs tend to be evil chancellor types. Comes out of Confucian historians' bias against Eunuchs in Chinese Culture. If a villain like this has supernatural powers, it could technically be considered a male, villainous case of virgin power, although very few eunuchs are chaste by choice.
