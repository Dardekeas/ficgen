Bob's a villain. He's an evil, cruel, sadistic bastard. But no matter how many puppies he kicks, nuns he throws into open wells, or orphans he starves to death, Bob always has a girlfriend. Funny, huh?

The villain's paramour is almost always defined in terms of her (or his) relationship to the villain. The role she plays in the plot, however, depends a great deal on how her character is defined. She may be just as evil as he is and actually share his goals. She could be a ditz who doesn't really like evil things but just isn't bright enough to realize she's in a relationship with a very bad person. In stories where the villain is allowed to be sympathetic on some levels (grey and gray morality, punch clock villain, etc.), she might love him for his better qualities.

Depending on her skill set she might actually be a valued member of the villain's criminal organization, in which she might overlap with the baroness or dark chick. If not, expect much grumbling from his underlings about why the boss even bothers to keep her around.

See Also: perky female minion for a similar character (usually) without an explicit relationship and unholy matrimony for a couple that are each villains in their own right. A lady macbeth is generally older and goads her partner into committing evil acts. Sometimes subject to a high heel-face turn.

Compare the mistress, mafia princess, daddy's little villain.
