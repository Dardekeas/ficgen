Swashbuckling, rum-swilling, dressed to plunder pirates in modern times.

Compare and contrast sky pirates. space pirates is when they are a few more centuries late. For modern, real life pirates of the type who are very good at shivering people's timbers (with an AK-47 not a cutlass), see ruthless modern pirates.

Compare to born in the wrong century for when they feel like they belong in the golden age of piracy.
