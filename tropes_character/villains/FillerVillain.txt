A new one-off big bad created just for a filler arc. Not the most dignified place for the villain, because that means the villain will have less effect on the actual canon than the weakest mooks in the real arcs. This puts the writers in an awkward position because they have to somehow make the villain a credible threat to the heroes, yet at the same time maintain that the threat is relatively new or extremely region contained to explain why such a huge threat wasn't a problem for the rest of the series - rather problematic if the heroes are already facing the upper tiers of the sorting algorithm of evil in canon.

Mostly common in anime based on manga, since the filler is used to help avoid overtaking the manga, or it could be in a non-serial movie. Either way, the villain wasn't in the source material, so of course he/she/it would have no effect on the actual canon. This can also cost him his joker immunity and all of them will die by the end.

Rare in Western media, but it does happen. The thing is that there has to be no canonical appearance, or even a mention of this villain after the arc. And the arc has to be filler, not just one that isn't mentioned (so onslaught doesn't count).

There is a 75% chance that most of them will be generic doomsday villains as well.

A sub-trope of canon foreigner.

Compare to the equally inconsequential monster of the week.
