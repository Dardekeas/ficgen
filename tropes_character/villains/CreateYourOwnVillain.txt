superheroes try to rid the world of villains. Unfortunately, sometimes they have the opposite effect.

Maybe the hero accidentally wronged some innocent bystander — say, they or their loved ones were casualties in the collateral damage from a super-battle — and said bystander decides to turn evil to settle the grudge. Alternatively, the character may already be evil, but the Hero's intervention results in the villain gaining superpowers, and a super-grudge to boot.

In a parody or deconstruction of this trope, it might go on to reveal that the actions of the hero were actually irrelevant in terms of the individual's true nature. They were ultimately a disturbed individual who was looking for the first excuse they could find to justify their evil behavior.

Naturally, this is common in comic books. In many cases, however, the villain's origin story isn't even hinted at in their first appearance—it's only after the villain becomes popular that they're given a personal tie to the Hero via retroactive continuity.

One of the causes of the superhero paradox. See also disproportionate retribution, nice job breaking it, hero. Contrast with weirdness magnet, where the Hero doesn't create the villains, but seems to attract them all the same.
