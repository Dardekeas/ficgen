In contrast to the generally sedentary right-hand cat, this is what happens when the villains' pet plays an active role as a guard/weapon against the heroes. Expect fluffy the terrible in terms of naming and for the villain to be a confirmed fluffy tamer. Typically, villains will either show a nightmare fetishist streak and be oblivious to how savage their pets are, and will treat them kindly, or else, they will use the pets to (perhaps even literally) kick the dog, sometimes by feeding underlings and other poor unfortunates to them. Finally, as the title suggests, when the creature in question isn't a fantasy animal, it's very likely to be some kind of canine.

It is, obviously, very prone to the dog bites back. Contrast with the various heroic loyal animal companions, particularly canine companion.
