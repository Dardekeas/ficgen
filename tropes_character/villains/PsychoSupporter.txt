A psycho supporter follows someone else's beliefs simply because the supporter is nuts.

Used a lot to deconstruct other tropes, most notably the genki girl, the dragon, and sycophantic servant. If this character is initially a good guy, a face-heel turn will most likely happen.

May also intersect with the poisonous friend, yandere, and lady macbeth. A lot of Psycho Supporters also suffer from mad love or the subordinate excuse if they're really devoted to the leader in question. Contrast stepford smiler.

Do not confuse with a character who supports a psycho; that's friend to psychos.

In real-life situations, they will usually be seen as a liability to the movement they support, and will constantly be told to stop being stereotypical.

no real life examples, please!
