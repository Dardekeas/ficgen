A sub-trope of monster clown, the enemy of the show is a dastardly white-faced, beret-wearing mute with world domination on his mind. Occasionally they are motivated by a lesser goal, but still, evil... and almost always French. A possible reason for this is that the late Marcel Marceau (the most famous mime in the world) was French.

Some Enemy Mime villains have your mime makes it real powers, such as the ability to erect an invisible wall or conjure an unheard gale-force wind which one must walk against. Others simply use gadgets to leech the world of sound and color, and hope and fluffy things right along with it. May or may not be affected by the "silence" condition when fought against.

Played for comedy far more often than monster clown. If he's particularly scruffy, he probably also looks like cesare. When a mime is not necessarily evil but everybody treats him or her as such, that's everyone hates mimes. When he's an antagonist who simply doesn't speak, it's silent antagonist. Similarly, this is not related to heroic mime. Also not related to enemy mine; the name is just a pun on that trope.
