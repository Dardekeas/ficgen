A "beginner's" villain, lowest on the sorting algorithm of evil (the heroes have to start off fighting someone). He is the first true threat to the heroes, not just some common mook who's there to let them show how badass they are. Expect even the weakest member of the heroic team to eventually become more powerful than him (that is, if he survives). The Starter Villain is not always associated with the intended big bad of the whole series, usually having a whole story arc to himself.

As writers can't always have the Starter Villain fighting the whole team at once, he'll sometimes have mooks. These men are nearly always doomed to die. He has a sliver of a chance to survive, but none of his men will make it.

If the series is not based on a pre-existing work, and the writers are making it up as they go along, a Starter Villain can end up turning into a breakout villain if the fans and/or the writers end up liking them enough.
