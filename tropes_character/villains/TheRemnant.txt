A (usually) villainous version of la résistance, The Remnant are members of a faction who are continuing to fight a war that their side has already lost. They may be using irregular military tactics, but they will probably still be dressed in their old uniforms (or the remnants thereof). Unlike a general ripper, The Remnant no longer hold an official position in the armed forces, often because their government has ceased to exist or has been replaced. In a number of cases, this happens because nobody on either side has yet been informed that the war is over. The losing side then becomes The Remnant by default after the fact.

This is sometimes truth in television, as guerrilla forces and paramilitary can be the scourge of entire countries, with no regard to the life of those they claim to defend.

For a more short term 'bigger brother' concept of this, see dragon their feet. In fact, the Dragon in question may end up leading these guys. May be the vestigial empire. The government they're trying to overthrow is likely the federation.

This tends to be a case of moral dissonance or out-of-universe moral myopia. Good guys who do this are determinators and la résistance and extra heroic for fighting in the face of near-impossible odds. Bad guys are just, well, bad.
