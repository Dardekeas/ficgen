There are villains that want your stuff, villains that want you to do what they want, villains that want you dead. This guy is nowhere near as wasteful. He wants what makes you you, and he wants it for himself.

When he beats you, he will take your abilities, your uniqueness, your everything and make them his own. He usually does this by literally absorbing or consuming you, though sometime he'll just take the pieces of you he likes and discard the rest. Either way, the more he gets, the stronger he gets. The stronger he gets, the more people he gets. This is his motivation.

This is a common attribute of zombies; zombie hordes tend to become more dangerous the more zombies are in them, so by zombifying humans they are essentially adding that human's strength to themselves.

This trope is about the motivation (usually for villains). The article about the plot is assimilation plot, oddly enough. Sometimes overlaps with the virus and/or all your powers combined. Distinct from power copying as it requires death or injury to the other party. A form of human resources, assuming the victims started as human. Compare cannibalism superpower, you are who you eat and unwilling roboticisation which describes methods for acomplishing this trope. The replacement by assimilation may be part of a plan to make things over in their own image.

He may fall victim to assimilation backfire.
