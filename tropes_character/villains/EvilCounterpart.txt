A character who looks like the protagonists and has/had abilities and obstacles similar to them, but is evil. Sometimes, but not always, a big bad. Classically, an embodiment of vice pitched against a correlating embodiment of virtue.

Frequently, the Evil Counterpart is the character equivalent of for want of a nail: he represents what our hero could have become as a result of a very small change in his backstory. They also save creators the trouble of thinking up new abilities to give their villains, especially for comic book heroes and video games (where new abilities have to be implemented). Because the hero and the evil counterpart are such great foils for each other, the counterpart has an excellent chance of being the hero's arch-enemy or a classic villain, although this is not always the case.

Often leads to a not so different moment.

Often a dark magical girl; contrast with the worthy opponent. Applied to an entire team, they are the psycho rangers. Applied to an entire race, they are an evil counterpart race.

sister trope to evil twin (evil biological twin), evil knockoff (intentionally created evil duplicate), and criminal doppelg√§nger (evil identical stranger).

if the first character to be introduced is the evil one, the good one would be his good counterpart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Every other
