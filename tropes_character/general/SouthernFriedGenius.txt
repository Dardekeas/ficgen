An inversion of the "idiotic redneck" stereotype people from the deep south often have attached to them, in a similar mould to black and nerdy.

This character may have the same down-home sensibilities or otherwise act like a good ol' southerner, but is very, very smart. Maybe they exhibit sesquipedalian loquaciousness alongside their southern vernacular, maybe they have a teleporter in their garage, maybe they have 11 ph.ds, who knows.

The simple country lawyer exemplifies this trope; he uses his intelligence and accent as a weapon, talking in simple allegories and colloquialisms in order to make people think he's a moron, then brutalizing them with his superior wit.

May overlap with good is not dumb. See also southern-fried private.
