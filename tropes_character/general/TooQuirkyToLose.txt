A participant in a contest of some sort is really not as good as some of the other participants, but wins first prize anyway thanks to a combination of various factors, but primarily sheer chutzpah.

Ironically, this character does not necessarily have to be the ace. In fact, he or she is sometimes a total loser (and not always even a cool loser) who triumphs through a fluke or dumb luck - or sometimes simply because he or she is simply too stupid to realize defeat.

This trope should be distinguished from popularity power, because the person in question usually isn't popular at all. It's also closely related to crouching moron, hidden badass, crazy awesome, and determinator. The term "dark horse" is a more charitable way of referring to a character with these attributes. Such a "dark horse" may win a dark horse victory if two superior competitors ignore him while focusing their efforts on each other.

See also karma houdini, which is the basic idea behind this trope, but applied to villains.
