A robot is fleeing, or just running, and, what's this? It's out of breath? Ooops, it banged its head! We'd better put a bandage on that! The trope for robots whose creators forgot they were robots, just didn't care, or thought it would be useful to give mechanical characters unexplained human traits, perhaps as a way of humanising them. This may be hand waved (he's not out of breath, his cooling fan is cycling) or in comedies just put down to the rule of funny.

Not to be confused with ridiculously human robots, where the traits are deliberate and are all about making the robot as human as possible. This trope is about the more obvious robots. Compare i would say if i could say.
