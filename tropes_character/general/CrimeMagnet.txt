This trope is situation where someone becomes a tempting target which others will try to take direct advantage of. This is usually through some quality of theirs.

Generally comes in three general flavors.

Type I - Taking advantage of someone else's good fortune.

Lets say Bob becomes wealthy. Hearing this, Alice, an acquaintance of Bob presents him with an investment opportunity, that can't possibly fail. Or maybe she announces that she's a long-lost relative of Bob, and if he could just help her out a little financially, she'd be eternally grateful. In general Alice wants to profit off Bob's wealth.

Another case is where Alice becomes famous, and Bob offers to become her publicity manager. He's offering not because he's experienced at this type of work, but because he can profit off of her publicity.

Type II - Being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

An example is Bob who doesn't have any street smarts. He's walking down the street in the wrong neighborhood, and is spotted by Alice, who sees him as an easy mark.

Type III - a lack of common sense that causes criminals to see you as an easy target.Bob has just come into some money, a lot of money. Maybe he won the lotto, maybe just got an inheritance, but he feels the need to tell anyone and everyone about it. Or maybe he just flashes his money around in public. Charlie sees this, and thinks he could part Bob from his money rather easily.

Compare mugging the monster. Contrast gold digger.
