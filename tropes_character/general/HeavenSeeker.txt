The character believes in a very desirable life after death. This may or may not motivate them to great deeds, including heroic sacrifice and becoming the soulsaver. The motivation can be egocentric, limited to personally getting there. Or it can be altruistic, trying to help others to reach the same ultimate goal.

Even if the desire for heaven is completely selfish at heart, the character is likely to behave well: Depending on what faith they follow they might think either that it increases their chances to get there, or simply that it is what the powers that be want. However, good behavior can have a touch of blue and orange morality, since the character's good deeds are likely to be focused on helping people follow whatever path they think leads to paradise, rather than helping people in this life.

Depending on the setting, the afterlife might be real and rightly understood, miscomprehended, symbolic, or a pure windmill.

If the character starts using abhorrent methods such as torturing/murdering "heretics", their methods makes them a soulsaving crusader if the behavior is justified within the setting and a knight templar if it is not.

Although some afterlife inspired by the Abrahamic heaven is the most common in western media, this trope can also include a quest for Nirvana or whatever. The core is that the final goal lies after death.
