This character type appears in child-friendly works. He is supposed to be a supreme badass, but is unfortunately hampered by his target audience. He is as much john mcclane as can be squeezed by the censors, and he is often much tougher than his companions. Still, he is usually not allowed to smoke, drink, bed numerous women, swear, or do too much fighting or killing, and that is quite a list of hurdles to making him a rough-edged mister falcon.

Expect huge amounts of gosh dang it to heck! and never say "die", although he will use the worst euphemisms he can get away with and "curse" more often than his companions. His favorite phrases are "kick some butt/tail" and "Shoot!" For some reason, this type of character tends to be totally radical.

The Badbutt tends to use family-friendly firearms. When he is wielding a sword, expect plenty of the inverse law of sharpness and accuracy.

Expect him to sound like clint eastwood, bruce willis, arnold schwarzenegger, james cagney, joe pesci, or one of many other "tough-guy" actors. (Occasionally it will be the genuine article, but more often they'll have a really good voice actor do an impersonation.)

Not to be confused with a Badass character who happens to be from a kids' show, movie, etc. (e.g. the cast of the Star Wars: Clone Wars shorts). has nothing to do with gasshole.

Compare clueless aesop, another trope where being kid-friendly can get in the way. rule-abiding rebel is when a character doesn't even try to come off as this. This character may also use parenthetical swearing and/or unusual euphemisms.
