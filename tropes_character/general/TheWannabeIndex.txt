An index of character types who, as the name implies, aspire to be something or someone that they're very often not. In some characters, this is cute, while for others, it's annoying. In others it's hilarious, or even heartbreaking, depending on how their character arc generally plays out. Some wannabes outright pretend to be what they are not â€” these are generally treated with no small amount of scorn.
