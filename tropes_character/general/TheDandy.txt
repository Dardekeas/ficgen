The dandy is intensely concerned with his clothing and appearance; he's always well-groomed and generally avoids physical exertion, lest he become mussed. His main pursuit is his comfort and lots of pretty things. He will be obsessed with maintaining the condition of his body and his clothing but will not necessarily be particularly interested in the attentions of the opposite sex. Dandy-ism can be found in characters of any degree of good or evil, as it is a personality trait rather than an alignment trait.

In comedic works, writers will saddle him with kid co-stars who don't buy his act at all or a gorgeous woman who happens to be incredibly cynical about men.

The modern use of the word "Dandy" is somewhat ironic, since the original dandies were rebelling against the fashion excesses of the macaronis, by choosing simpler, 'more masculine' clothes, that emphasized high-quality fabrics and immaculate tailoring rather than excessive decoration.

Being male is not a requirement, especially for bifauxnen. Very likely to overlap with gentleman snarker or upper-class twit. Compare and contrast sharp-dressed man. Many of these males may fall under in touch with his feminine side.

A rough distaff counterpart would be the fashionista. For the version of this that jumps at combat rather than running from it, see agent peacock.

not to be confused with the long running british comic of the same name.
