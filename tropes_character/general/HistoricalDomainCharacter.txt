Simply put, it's taking a well-known person from real life history and using this person as a character in a work. This does mean any work of that kind, whether it's historical fiction, a hollywood history story, or a well researched and accurate biopic of events. Or maybe classical composers were secretly sleeper agents for extraterrestrials. Whatever works.

Naturally this covers a lot of works (save for non-fiction), but given how often people can disagree about real history and our present, it would be hard to draw a line between which fictional works would fit and which fictional works wouldn't. Thus all are included.

Note that despite "Historical" in the name, present people are included. Please remove troping in these peoples' pages as you browse.
