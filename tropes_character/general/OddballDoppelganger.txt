At first, you'd think this character would be the long-lost twin of another character. But then you start to notice the differences. This character just seems off. It could be due to having a completely opposite personality (without being a full-on evil twin). It could be due to exaggerating the original character's foibles. This character may even appear to be an off model version of the original.

Regardless, this character is like a funhouse reflection of the original - distorted in possibly unimaginable ways, but still clearly patterned after the original.

Compare with evil knockoff and evil twin (the more sinister versions) and send in the clones (when multiple oddball doppelganger characters are introduced to cash in on the popularity of the original). Can lead to other me annoys me. For the original German word, see doppelg√§nger.
