People who can see into the future, past and to faraway places. People can be born with this or gain it through freak accidents. If the latter, expect a reset button.

When a seer is really powerful, she is the omniscient or a omniscient hero. However, it might turn out that she is not so omniscient after all.

A common power of the magical seventh son.
