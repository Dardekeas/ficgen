Not a serious character. Oh, they're officially in canon, but no matter what exploits they accomplish, you won't see it referenced much. That's not what fans are looking for. These are "Funnybook" characters who are actually funny. Any use of them is usually restricted to their own book, where they can do wild and fun stuff. They are solely for positive consumption.

Sometimes the character isn't even used that often, but their presence fuels conversation within fandom. Often such characters become a meterstick for fans: one camp claims they're too silly or insulting to continuity, while the other says comics can be fun and these fans should lighten up.

Actual writers seem to pick up on this, and don't usually dare more than cameos in "serious" books.

Beware trying to make these characters darker and edgier; you'll get flak from both the people who liked them, and the people who dislike them, and don't care how many guns or pouches you strap to them.

Opposite trope to knight of cerebus; the Sanguine member of a four-temperament ensemble.
