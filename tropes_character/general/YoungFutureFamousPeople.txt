This is basically the spinoff babies trope applied to real people. The idea is to take historical domain characters and depict them in their youth. It can be played for laughsâ€”implying that people we normally think of as reserved, stoic, or even evil were once young and reckless themselves. (Or the opposite, where they are shown to possess the same traits and interests that later made them famous, even if realistically these would have come much later.) Of course, it may also be played straight.

If the person lived long enough ago that details of their adolescence or youth are obscure or even nonexistent, then this trope may be used as an excuse to ground an entirely fictional story in reality. Sometimes these characters are the leading characters, other times they may only serve as a fictional cameo or a shout-out to a historical in-joke.

Obviously a standard trope in historical fiction.

A sub-trope of historical-domain character.

A sister trope to in the past, everyone will be famous, literary agent hypothesis (can overlap when a minor character in a movie turns out to be the author of the book the movie is based on).
