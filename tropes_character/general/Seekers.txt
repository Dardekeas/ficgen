A seeker quests for the truth, uncovering mysteries, lies, deception and gaining knowledge about themselves and the universe.

Not to be confused with the Seekers from Transformers (Skywarp, starscream, Thundercracker, et al), who are generally sadistic assholes. Also not to be confused with the Quidditch position in Harry Potter, or the book series by Erin Hunter, which you can find here. Or, for that matter, the Australian band from the 60s.
