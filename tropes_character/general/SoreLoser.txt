There are many ways of taking a loss. Alice, for example, will admit defeat, compliment the one who bested them and in case of death, go out with a smile. And Bob.... won't.

The Sore Loser is a character who takes defeat very ungraciously, no matter what kind of defeat it was. Unlike his graceful counterpart, Bob will get very snippy and bad tempered, insult his opponent, accuse him of cheating, rant about his "superior skills" and, in some extreme cases, even try to kill his rival. Depending on the setting, he could do things like flipping the table, throw away the cards he was using, angrily swipe all the remaining pieces from the chessboard, and so on. In a fighting series, Bob will usually lose his calm behavior, resort to cheap tricks in order to win, adopt a more ruthless and brutal strategy or unleash a dangerous forbidden technique just to have a chance. storming off in a huff is also an alternative.

Of course, Bob's opponent Carol engages in unsportsmanlike gloating, she's basically giving Bob free license to react however he likes. The winner's reaction is a good way of telling who the sympathetic character is supposed to be in this exchange.

This trope is often the launching pad for villainous breakdown, attempted "the reason you suck" speech and in some extreme cases, one-winged angel. if i can't have you could be considered as the romantic version of this trope.

A sister trope to second place is for losers (and usually overlaps unless it's not the loser that thinks this), and unsportsmanlike gloating (being a sore winner).

Compare rage quit, defiant to the end, taking you with me. Contrast graceful loser, touch√©.
