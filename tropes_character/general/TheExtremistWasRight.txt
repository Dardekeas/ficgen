The scale of morality swings quite a ways, from incorruptible pure pureness to a complete monster, and it gets even more confusing when you factor in anti villains and anti heroes. But they're all easily defined. The all-loving hero is the ultimate neutral good; an anti-villain is a very morally ambiguous villain, and a well-intentioned extremist is someone who does the wrong things for the right reasonsor at least reasons right to his mind.

Right?

Not always. Here are the people whom everyone, sometimes even the viewers, thought were the well-intentioned extremist or knight templar that always clichédly turns out to be wrong  but instead they were completely right about how to go about making the world a better place, and not only are they genuinely working toward a better world, they've actually succeeded in doing so, or else succeed during the course of the story. These are actual genuine examples of that term that so many villains falsely claim to be, necessary evils. At least, they are in the context of the story.

Compare/contrast well-intentioned extremist, villain with good publicity, jerkass has a point, utopia justifies the means and necessarily evil. Also see poisonous friend, when an ally of the hero does this so the hero never has to. The omniscient morality license is a common result of this trope being mishandled. The specifically religious version is the soulsaving crusader. Often a result of the ending; expect spoilers. Contrast fascist, but inefficient when a government is both ruthless and incompetent.
