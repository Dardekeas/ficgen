Also known as mercenaries (mercs for short), Soldiers of Fortune, and a dozen other names.. These characters can have a wide range of personalities, some with honor, or codes, or limitations, and others who will kill anybody to get the job done. The only common thread is that whatever they're into, it's a job, and they're getting paid.
