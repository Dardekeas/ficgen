Basically characters who (usually) have a lot of money, or at least their families do.

It doesn't matter if they flaunt their wealth with fancy cars and jewelry, or live austere lives. It doesn't matter if they are old money or nouveau riche.

In fiction, they tend to gather in places like beverly hills.
