Alice knows Bob very well. She can always tell what he's feeling. She'll probably say something like:

 "You always clean when you're angry."

 "You're only nice to me when something is wrong."

 "Whenever you have a bad day at work, your foot shakes."

The idea is that Alice can tell something about Bob's emotional state because he is performing a significant but unrelated action. Expect Bob to deny it. Don't expect to ever see him perform this action again, even though he supposedly does it all the time.

Writers will often use the tell to inform the audience what is going on with a character who wouldn't normally share his feelings.

See also you can always tell a liar and pinocchio nose for cases where Alice can tell that Bob is lying. See the magic poker equation for poker tells. Supertrope to heartbreak and ice cream ("when you're heartbroken you eat ice cream a lot"), comfort food and post-stress overeating.
