A character, usually a somewhat unassuming one, is inserted into an unusual situation or world. But rather than having difficulty adjusting, the character possesses knowledge, a personality type or physical prowess that allows him to leap up the social ladder to a far higher station than the one he had back home.

See also the unfrozen caveman lawyer. Can also be a mighty whitey (if a European does this in a non-European society) or a case of villains blend in better (if a villain does this when a hero becomes a fish out of water). Compare never accepted in his hometown. Contrast fish out of water.
