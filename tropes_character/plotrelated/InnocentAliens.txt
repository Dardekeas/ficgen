Not all space aliens in fiction are evil invaders who terrorize our fair planet with their high-tech war machines, and demand to be taken to our leader. Some of them are in fact quite nice. They're not looking for any trouble, and all they want is to be left alone, make a friend, or just get by in our strange and unfamiliar Earth culture.

The innocent aliens are like this. They've just arrived at our planet (though in some, rarer cases, we go to theirs, instead) and are total babes in the woods, displaying a very warped understanding of the humans' way of life. They're wide-eyed and childlike, and occasionally even need protection from hostile human beings, often trigger-happy military types who think they're up to no good and need to be exterminated for the common good.

In some kinds of stories, these aliens are used to prove that humans are the real monsters, especially if they or the rest of the interplanetary community live peaceful, enlightened lives and we humans are the ones who go around shooting things and generally being destructive.

Often the "come in peace" part of we come in peace  shoot to kill. Contrast aliens are bastards. If they're played for laughs, they may also be amusing aliens as well.

In one called "Report on 'Grand Central Terminal'", alien scientists arrive to Earth after a nuclear war wiped out all life. They completely fail to understand things like the monetary system and think that war between the members of one species is impossible. The only alien who figures it out is dismissed by his superiors.
