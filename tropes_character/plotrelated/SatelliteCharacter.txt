A character whose motivations and overall personality essentially revolve around their interaction with another, possibly more interesting, character with whom they really should be on an equal standing. Without this interaction, they would otherwise be pretty bland.

Sometimes a series will remove that "central" person from the equation somehow, and the Satellite Character has to establish their own motives. This is a common way to make a battle butler more interesting. On the other hand, a spin-off can fail entirely if the star is a Satellite Character whose character can't support their own stories.

Contributing to their poor image in some circles, badly-written magical girlfriends become Satellite Characters if not outright satellite love interests with disturbing frequency.

Note that not all satellite characters are friendly, though... Some satellites are the exact opposite, full of all-consuming jealousy, rage, bitterness, vengefulness, or outright hatred, orbiting until the time is right to crash violently into the character they circle. This is EXCEEDINGLY rare, though.

Likely to count if the character is the fat girl, black best friend, pet homosexual, or uncool redhead.

Contrast the friends who never hang, where a character has developed interaction with a much larger number of characters except for one or two significant exceptions.

Has nothing to do with a story where the character in question is a living Satellite, nor a character that happened to be punched or rocketed into orbit.
