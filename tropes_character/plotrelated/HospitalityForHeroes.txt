Publicly being the hero can sometimes be a thankless task. The bad guys know where to find you, your loved ones can get stuffed in the fridge, and the only solace sometimes is that you passed what you are in the dark. On top of that, it's generally just stressful work.

Even for a normal person, similar things can apply. no good deed goes unpunished, or you simply don't come out on top on karma. After you spent your pocket money replacing something for a kid who just got robbed, you don't have cash for the place you were going to have your only meal of the day at while you contemplated what to give up to pay the late rent.

It could even be all a part of the job. Being a social worker or the subjectively "mean", but effective teacher can be thankless, and often doesn't even pay well.

Fortunately, there's another rare soul who's also good, and does what they can to help. This soul is also a business person, and at explicit cost to herself, provides the good with a good. Need a shopkeeper to show gratitude to the hero who saved the town from the villain? The hero will not be allowed to pay for goods/food/drink. Want to show someone who does the good deed for a living is also exceedingly honest? Have them decline such an offer.

To some extent, they can get away with this, because the economic impact of losing a customer or two may not be that large, or the personal impact of making sure the "customer" has had their deed paid forward. They may also believe it's important that the good guy has one less stressor or burden to deal with due to their good deeds, whether they know it or not.

If others know this to be an occasional offer for good deeds, the morale boost and customer loyalty this causes can be effective for business, and for the general well-being of everyone around.
