When a food is said to be loathed by someone, sometimes to the point of characterization. Basically, the exact opposite of the trademark favorite food.

Not to be confused with i do not like green eggs and ham. Also has nothing to do with junk e-mail (which many of us quite justifiably despise) .

Sometimes these will fall under stock yuck, turned up to eleven for one person. Otherwise, expect something either so universally loved that no-one understands their problem, or so rarely encountered that you wonder how they manage to build up such a hatred of it.

Sometimes, an extreme omnivore will have just that one item they don't like, and this trope will be played for laughs. In this case, it's usually something very mundane, so that while a character might be willing to eat disgusting and probably poisonous mixtures, they absolutely refuse to eat something everyone else enjoys.

(Ironically, although Spam is an acquired taste for most people, it's not actually that horrible, and it's very popular in much of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii and South Korea.)
