Why should the evil overlord have all the genre savvy knowledge? Anyone can figure out what to do, depending on what kind of fiction they are in, and what kind of character they are.

Read these lists, and you'll be dangerously genre savvy, or close enough. Fail to read them, and your genre blindness will condemn you to pick up any idiot ball you see, perhaps even become too dumb to live. Just make sure you read the right list. As a note, any one of these might count just as well for another kind of story (for example, Caveat Emptor when entering the little shop that wasn't there yesterday is a given in both a transformation comic and a horror story) but it's your choice how much of each genre you decide to be savvy about in any given moment.

Note that developing one's character further, whether good or evil, is always beneficial. No matter what genre you're in, it makes you popular among the fanbase, and may even make the story more popular- which is, again, always good. Done properly, it may even induce characters of the opposite side to assist you.
