An injured character refuses to stay in bed, despite medical advice. And though he says it's only a flesh wound, we know better. Sometimes the injured party might go to great lengths to hide his injuries from the other characters, knowing that he will get taken off the field. Other times, the character is mortally wounded and fights on regardless.

In military situations, often indicates strong esprit de corps or desperate danger, or both. Frustration with his ignorance — he doesn't know what is happening on the field, to his comrades, or what danger he is in — may come into play. It may also indicate that the character has been taunted by another and is desperate to prove himself.

Packing off the injured to safety may have to override this impulse, and doesn't always work. On the other hand, despite the danger, this can be survived, sometimes — but the very fact that the story shows real injuries shows also that they can lead to the logical denouement. particularly likely if the character is trying to prove something. Even in milder cases, when victory is achieved, post-victory collapse is likely to result.

He may use bottled heroic resolve to keep going. This attitude is one way to become an annoying patient. If the escape attempt has success, it's a case of the patient has left the building.
