Someone who is not so weak is shy and a natural target for a bully. The person looks harmless. You, as the bully, think that you can just walk all over this person without their raising an objection. And you will find you're right.

Go ahead, take their stuff or break it. They won't stop you. Are you angry at them? A scolding or outright abuse is bound to be effective â€” they have little self esteem. This person simply can't or won't defend themselves.

And yet. They tolerate it if you hurt them; but if you hurt anyone else, and they see you, then they're not going to stand for it. They will step in. Humankind is their protectorate.

This person places no value on themselves, but they will do whatever they can for anyone whom they feel needs help. They'll usually avoid outright violence, thus maintaining the appearance of weakness. But they will sometimes use violence (proving themselves not so weak) to protect a loved one or innocent bystander. They just will never feel the need to protect themselves.

May overlap with the so-called coward, but not always. the so-called coward simply avoids fights of all sorts, except for the ones with the highest stakes. Someone who is not so weak does not believe they themself are worth defending, and is more likely to end up either as a punching bag or as the person esacalating a fight involving someone else. Or both in turns.

Often overlaps with cowardly lion. Compare mama bear for an example with a more specific protectorate involved.
