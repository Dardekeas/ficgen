A stock plot: an ugly duckling loses the glasses, takes down her hair, maybe gets a little makeup and some nicer clothes and eventually walks down the stairs as a swan.

Another version of this would be "Miss Jones Syndrome", where a dowdy, bespectacled woman switches to contacts, shakes loose her hair, and is told by the unrequited object of her affections, "Why, Miss Jones, you are beautiful."

This is mainly possible because most of the "ugly" women on TV or in the movies are beautiful actresses in bad clothes, though it also has something to do with Hollywood's unforgivingly narrow standards of physical attractiveness, particularly for women.

Story-wise, it's a nice little way of advancing an aesop about how looks aen't everything, while saving the hero from actually having to go out with an ugly girl (see also: sweet and sour grapes).

Opposed by nerds are sexy. See she is all grown up for the related prettification of a childhood friend. Contrast just the way you are, unnecessary makeover. The trope, she cleans up nicely, often differs in that the girl in question might like rough casual clothes or work gear most of the time, she knows damn well she can look stunningly good when she wants to be.

See also i just want to be beautiful as the reason this trope exists.

Compare with i just want to be special and i just want to be loved when beauty isn't the only thing they desire and get before being revealed as beautiful all along.

Contrast irony as she is cast, where this is always the potential, but it is never tapped.

Nowadays, this trope is dead in the water, but it's still used from time to time.
