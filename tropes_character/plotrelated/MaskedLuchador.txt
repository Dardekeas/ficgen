In lucha libre, the Mexican sport of pro wrestling, it is common for a wrestler to wear a mask,

never revealing their true identities to the public, much like comicbook superheroes and villains. To be unmasked by a rival wrestler, or indeed anyone at all, is considered an irredeemable dishonor.

The stock characterization for a luchador is a kindly gentle giant who loves kids. This is from the story of Fray Tormenta (Friar Storm), a Catholic priest who started wrestling to earn money for his orphanage. Villainous luchadores are pretty rare.

This trope goes hand-in-hand with the cool mask trope.
