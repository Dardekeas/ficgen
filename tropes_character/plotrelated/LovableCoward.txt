The flip side of the dirty coward is the Lovable Coward. Not quite a hero, completely lacking in heroic impulses, but even as he shamelessly runs and hides we somehow still find ourselves rooting for him. His cowardice is sometimes played for comedy, sometimes portrayed as simply the most sensible course of action; it seldom if ever endangers innocents. The Lovable Coward never (or hardly ever) puts honor before reason - and considers this a point of pride. The Lovable Coward is often a trickster, specializing in weaseling his way out of dangerous situations. He may be a cowardly sidekick; if he is the main hero, he may find himself an accidental hero for all the wrong reasons.

Contrast: dirty coward, the so-called coward, miles gloriosus, cowardly lion.
