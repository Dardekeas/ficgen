There are two sisters, close enough in age to have a relatively equal relationship, but light years apart in personality. More often than not, they can be roughly described as follows:

 The Beautiful Sister: An attractive, outgoing, fashionable, popular, but unintellectual character. If older, she'll be more mature in "womanly" ways. Can range from smart yet  The Smart Sister: A bookish, explicitly smart character. Very often a While it is usually made clear that they love each other, the sisters are constant verbal combatants. Most of the time they find each other incomprehensible. Sometimes they both harbour a secret inferiority complex, which they hide through the constant banter: the smart sister feels awkward and unattractive or downright ignored to favor the other and thus reacts out of envy, while the popular sister feels she's either not being taken seriously or downright hated by the other and lashes back out of insecurity. The sisters may become love rivals, but often they prefer very different types. The smart sister is usually the younger of the two and in many cases more sympathetic, though exceptions (smart older sister, popular younger sister) are fairly common. This is often the result of writers themselves having been the Smart One and thus often projecting their own feelings on the Smart Sister character, though many a reader can relate.
