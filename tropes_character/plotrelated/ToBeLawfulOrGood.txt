The classic debate, named for the Catch-22 situation which often confronts lawful good dungeons & dragons characters (particularly paladins), for a dilemma which may face any character who is defined in part by their struggle to remain good while upholding the stability of the system they live in. For whatever reason, this character has encountered a situation where doing the right thing involves breaking a law, personal code, or a binding rule that makes the character the fettered. The character must then decide to either break the law and move towards chaotic/neutral good, or put the law of the land first and become more lawful neutral.

Three things can happen in these situations.

1: The character switches sides, breaks the law, or removes his moral restraints in the name of doing the right thing. This can result in a full alignment change to chaotic/neutral good or at least shake the character's stance, and also will often put the character at odds with other lawful characters. Woe betide a hero who does this if they have lawful evil superiors.

2: The character wants to help, but cannot bring himself to break the established laws, codes or rules. Maybe they believe that a breaking of the rules will result in worse things, maybe they think that it is their job to be the force of order, leaving law breaking up to the vigilante man, or maybe they weren't as assured in their morals as they thought and the idea of doing something not enshrined in law scares them too much. If the moral oversight was too great, may result in them sliding lawful neutral or, in the case of really big infractions or cases of my master, right or wrong or my country, right or wrong may lead them into becoming a worthy opponent or noble demon type of character, establishing them as a villain or causing previously heroic characters to effectively undergo a face-heel turn. If called out, they may try to deny responsibility by saying that they're just following orders.

3: Clever characters take a third option. Maybe they tell something from a certain point of view or find a way of doing the right thing whilst not violating the letter of the law that would otherwise prevent them from doing so. Failing that, they may not be able to interfere themselves, but they'll contact the proper authorities or get a less Lawful character to act on their behalf, leading to a rescue by the cavalry. A character may consider that not acting would be an even greater violation of his code or law system than holding back and letting things go through.

The LG character may alternatively combine a zeroth law rebellion and good is not nice and interpret the dilemma such that he or she realizes it isn't a dilemma, or was an engineered false dilemma. lawful good doesn't mean lawful stupid, after all.

Rather than save the villain he knows will go and kill more people, he rationalizes that letting him fall off a cliff isn't technically breaking any law... and while pulling him up would be the RightÂ™ thing to do, not pulling him up isn't a terribly evil action, especially if they were mean to the dog earlier. Or conversely, maybe something else is likely to catch up with the villain in the near future, anyway, so that the consequences of saving the villain, letting the villain die, or killing the villain are all fairly equivalent.

Note that while this trope is named for the dungeons & dragons alignments, it still occurs in settings that lack explicitly categorized metaphysical morality; it doesn't require that the character have an actual alignment of Lawful or Good (or exist in a setting where those descriptions are meaningful), only that their personal ethical code and some laws that they normally respect are in conflict.

This is somewhat a truth in television, as many times in history humans have had to choose between what the law system expects of them and what their conscience or the circumstances demand. Despite this, no real life examples please. The fact that this trope reflects dilemmas that people have faced and pondered about in equal measure throughout the centuries is what makes it so recogniseable; we must all have wondered what we would do if faced with a situation where we had to break the law to do the right thing from our perspectives; to breach societies moral bounds to preserve our own.

This can involve everything from face heel turns to major plot points. While an attempt has been made to limit the spoilers, they are present.

Often a subtrope of conflicting loyalty and moral dilemma. And possibly justified criminal. A common dilemma for the paladin (especially if there's a jerkass dm at the table), but by definition a Paladin always chooses good over law. See also frequently-broken unbreakable vow.

This trope is often brought up whenever a super registration act is played in as well.

In Western Sources, the default choice is "Chaotic" so often that it may be hard to spot the choice.
