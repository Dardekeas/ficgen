An exaggerated form of for the evulz, where a character feels the need to do evil things even at times such actions are clearly not in their best interests. Such characters will betray allies, kill team-mates, be a jerk for no reason, be petty, piss off all the wrong people, attack fellow villains to prove they're eviler and generally be suicidally stupid simply because it's eeeevil.

This, along with chaotic stupid, is also often one of the reasons the forces of evil never manage to destroy the forces of good: it's not particularly evil to work with others, or acquire wealth and power through legal means, and so forth.

Compare with lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid neutral and stupid good. Contrast with pragmatic villainy. If an antagonist momentarily becomes Stupid Evil, they've caught a villain ball. See also dick dastardly stops to cheat, where a villain sabotages their own scheme by doing evil when they could've won by playing fair.

Not to be confused with stupid criminals.
