There is an emergency, threatening the entire kingdom. Even the king admits he is not capable of dealing with it, so he finds his wisest and most able knight and grants that knight total power.

Why? Because the king knows this knight is a man of honor and also loves his family more than he loves power. He will use this power only for when it is needed, and no longer. It is true. Once the kingdom is saved, that knight abdicates his power and goes home to his family.

Often overlaps with call to agriculture, when the retired character decides to raise cabbages in manly obscurity.

Partly because this is a highly idealistic trope, it's extremely rare in fiction, but notable for when it happens. However, it's truth in television: not only did it happen with Cincinnatus, but all succeeding Roman dictators ("he who dictates [orders]") also willingly gave up power before or at the end of the prescribed six months, up to and throughout the Punic Wars. It is only with Sulla, after the office had not been used for over a hundred years, that any Roman attempted to abuse the dictatorship. And even Sulla, while abusing his dictatorial power in many ways and having arranged to not have a time limit on his dictatorship, still stepped down after a year. The first successful attempt to defy this tradition came without the actual (specific) title of dictator, and resulted in the creation of the roman empire.

Of course some evil overlords gain their power by feigning this and crowning themselves emperor when the time is right. Some might even have arranged for the emergency to happen in the first place.

When played more cynically it may overlap with honor before reason.

Subtrope of reluctant ruler.

Of course Cincinnatus has to be extremely careful that he doesn't end up as titus andronicus instead...

Compare the last dj (the character has the same integrity but often far less power or freedom).

Contrast regent for life, unfit for greatness.
