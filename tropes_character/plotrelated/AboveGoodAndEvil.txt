A character declares that he or his objectives should not be hindered by considerations about good and evil. Such "meaningless, fallacious false dichotomies" are for simple-minded beings, not for him. He often terms them antiquated or childish propaganda, and may go on to question what is evil?. This trope usually applies to villains, though very occasionally a hero may say 'screw right and wrong, I'm doing what I want.'

Associated with the übermensch and the straw nihilist, along with any other things Nietzsche-related. Other people who can claim this trope include particularly megalomaniacal narcissists with delusions of godhood, sociopaths, scientists who do not let moral-societal opinions interfere with their quest for empirical knowledge, or just someone with blue and orange morality. Can be a sign of an eldritch abomination and such creatures beyond standard human morality, thus very common in a cosmic horror story and narratives where nature is not nice.

The exact objectives of this character differ widely. Sometimes it is power, other times knowledge, or in the case of the übermensch, his own values to replace traditional morality.

In some cases their willingness to do anything to get there is absolute though some ubermenschs may have a set of standards apart from the usual good/evil that they go by. In the case of darker villains holding to this philosophy expect them to suffer from laser-guided karma. When suffering payback, the character rarely excuses the wrong done to them under the same principle.

Compare bad is good and good is bad. Villains whose strong point is not logic will sometimes use both tropes. not cheating unless you get caught is a related concept, but it's more practical than philosophical.
