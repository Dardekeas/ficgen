The character tries to act like either a heartless bastard or otherwise obnoxious Jerkass when he really isn't.

His reasons might be because he is afraid to get intimate with other people because he simply assumes that the person will either die or betray him just like everyone else he has ever gotten close to. It might be because the person is being stalked by horrible demons, the mafia, the government, or some other dangerous and unstoppable entity and does not want to drag others into it. In more light-hearted media, maybe he just feels he has a reputation to uphold as a Jerkass. So rather than letting anyone get close to him, he behaves like a completely obnoxious douche bag to scare them all away from wanting anything to do with him.

See also it's not you, it's my enemies, defrosting ice queen, think nothing of it, don't you dare pity me!. May secretly be a zero approval gambit. Not to be confused with the jerkass known as fassad.Compare with jerk with a heart of gold. The jerk with a heart of gold really is a jerk, naturally rude and offensive, but also cares more deeply than it appears. A Jerkass Facade comes in when a character is not a jerk, is naturally caring and pleasant, but makes a deliberate decision to act in a jerkish manner to achieve some sort of goal.

Contrast bitch in sheep's clothing and jerk with a heart of jerk.
