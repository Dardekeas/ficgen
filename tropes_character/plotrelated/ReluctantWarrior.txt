A lot of heroes fight for peace, love, friendship, justice and all that sort of stuff. Occasionally they believe in violence as a last resort and as dirty business, following the path of the martial pacifist and falling back on their prodigious martial training only as the very last resort while avoiding unnecessary deaths. The Reluctant Warrior isn't quite so blessed, he lacks the improbable aiming skills that could make his dealing with them bloodlessly possible. What's more, he will find himself constantly facing enemies who mean to hurt or kill him and his friends, and who won't pick up a villain ball and dispose of themselves.

Nonetheless, they stand by their actual pacifist ideology and continually try to give peace a chance, even when doing so verges on being a horrible judge of character when offered to irredeemably evil opponents. Sadly, they will still rack up a body count. Even so, they won't give up trying to hold to their heroic vow, even if it's functionally a frequently-broken unbreakable vow. They keep trying since they know that pure pacifism will cause more problems than solve, even if it means having to fight and kill again.

Because of these conflicting impulses, straight heroes who are Reluctant Warriors will spend a lot of time agonizing over their choices and circumstances, but somehow manage to keep the angst under control (well, until the villain tries to break them by talking about their similarities). An anti-hero or anti-villain who is a Reluctant Warrior (it can happen) likely has some underlying good goal and means well — for loose definitions of "well" — and nonetheless laments but will not hesitate to use force.

Contrast suicidal pacifism. Compare heroic neutral and slave mooks. Contrast blood knight, who is this trope's exact opposite.
