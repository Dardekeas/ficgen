Lust is an intense desire for something that doesn't properly have material existence. It is most commonly understood as sexual desire for another, but can in fact refer to massive desire for anything abstract. Lust for power is a very common motivation for villains, especially the evil overlord. Conquest, honour, respect, and knowledge are also things that can be lusted after.

Sexual lust is a character trait of the chivalrous pervert, covert pervert, the casanova, lovable sex maniac, dirty old man, all women are lustful, and panty thief. It often leads to death by sex. The worst practitioners of this sin in a sexual sense are usually predators of some kind who prey on others, like the stalker with a crush, those who practice villainous incest, the vilest of serial killers and the villain who says "i have you now, my pretty."

This is similar to greed, but greed refers to desire for material possessions, lust is desire for abstract concepts. Like greed, lust is rarely satisfied, and just keeps growing until it often brings down the character. Both often go hand in hand with gluttony.
