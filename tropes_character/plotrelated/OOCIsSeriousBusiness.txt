The title should be read as "Out-of-Character Is serious business."

some characters have strong traits that they are known by. This is for when a character momentarily breaks away from their normal habits to make a point or because the plot demands it. Often causes the other characters to do a double take and mention why this event is serious business. When most or all of these OoC moments happen at once, you can be sure that the world is ending, or at least the darkest hour, leading characters to behave in ways they normally wouldn't, because they know they might not have another chance to do so.

It's also a pretty good indication the godzilla threshold has been crossed.

This is a trope for when a somewhat-out of character action is used to draw extra attention to the scene (similar to a title drop). It isn't hidden depths because it isn't telling us something about the character we didn't already know; it's similar to an out-of-character moment in that this is specifically the usage of such a moment to draw attention to a scene. If they're doing this deliberately to make another character think something is amiss, see out-of-character alert. Compare let's get dangerous and weirder than usual.
