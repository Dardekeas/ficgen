A strange form of kick the dog in war movies, where the heroes (or more often, the side that the heroes fight for) commit a war crime of some sort, most often mistreatment of enemy prisoners of war or civilians. Done to illustrate that most wars aren't instances of black and white morality, as well as the mix of good and bad in most armies and how wartime can change a person's personality. Sometimes, these crimes will be reprisals for earlier ones against the heroes' side. May sometimes overlap with token evil teammate.

A fairly young trope that emerged from the previously-hidden truth in television of the vietnam war. Often used to show that war is hell. Contrast the women are safe with us, would not shoot a civilian.

It is important to note that this scene, whether in real life or in a work, does not mean the entire army rapes pillages and burns. Unless the work in question is an author tract about how armies are evil, in which case it might be included for this purpose.
