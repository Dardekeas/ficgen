A maritime tradition that if a ship is sinking, the Captain should remain aboard it, or at least be the last one to escape. This can also extend to other crewmen, usually so they can oversee and direct passengers onto the lifeboats first. The latter often goes hand in hand with "women and children first" (leading to jokes where adult men dress in drag or like children). A common twist in comedic works is for the captain to appoint someone else captain and let them go down with the ship. Sometimes the new captain then uses the "promotion" to reassign the old captain as captain, often going back and forth repeatedly until they both go under.

Originally came about because of maritime salvage laws - if the ship was abandoned by all the crew but didn't sink, anyone who got on board could claim the ship and contents as salvage. So a senior officer had to remain until it was clear that the ship really was going to sink (or at least be the last to leave) to prevent embarrassing losses of cargo and/or repairable ships.

In many cases, the captain goes down with the ship because he would face major disgrace if he didn'tâ€”especially if the ship is only sinking because of his screw-up.Because, of course, space is an ocean this also applies to starship captains. Even though there's no (literal) "down" for them to go...

No relation to die for our ship.
