Picture your favorite character in a crime drama and think of their backstory. Got it? Good.

ItÂ’s almost a certainty that they were abused as a child, probably by an alcoholic parent. Was the other parent dead? Maybe even both parents were dead. A stint in foster care is common. How about an irresponsible or troubled younger sibling that said character spent their earlier years taking care of? Do they have a history of failed romances and a fairly dismal personal life?

The probability of most of these criteria matching is higher than not. This is because on crime dramas, almost across the board, this backstory is used for at least one of the lead characters.

The common backstory includes several of the following:

 Child abuse, usually, but not always, at the hands of a parent.

 An alcoholic parent.

  A stint in foster care.

  Directly or indirectly, but never on purpose, caused a death.

 A close family member or friend who suffered from a mental illness and/or committed suicide.

 Very low family income, bordering on poverty.

 A troubled or irresponsible younger sibling that the character may feel responsible for or an angelic and perfect younger sibling who they  A dead spouse and/or child.

 A trail of failed romances, possibly even a  Little to no personal life, often a result of the character being Some of these characteristics are more popular than others, and a character's backstory, by no means, needs to display all of them. It may only need to include two or three, depending on which two or three, to qualify.

This trope is used almost exclusively in straight dramas, where characters tend to have dark and troubled pasts, as opposed to dramadies or comedies, though certain elements of the backstory, such as a dead parent, are not uncommon in dramadies. It is also seems to occur more often in lead characters, though it is not unheard of for a supporting character to follow the pattern. Additionally, the trope doesn't apply exclusively to law enforcement agents and is equally as common when a main character is a consultant for a law enforcement agency.

This seems to be a newer trope, as it was not apparent in crime dramas as recently as the 1990s.

May result in a broken bird or jerk with a heart of gold. Perhaps because true art is angsty.
