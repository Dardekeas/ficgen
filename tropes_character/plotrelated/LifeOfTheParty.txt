For whatever reason, there is a party. Whilst a party is normally going to be a fairly festive affair in its own right, sometimes it just needs spicing up - this is where life of the party comes into play.

This character will don lampshades (no not necessarily that kind), dance on tables, swing from the chandelier and generally party harder and wilder than anybody else. Sometimes this is done to signify just how awesome a party is, other times it can be to show that the character is immature or is acting inappropriately - say, by drinking excessively at a fancy, upper class tuxedo party and hitting on the mayor's daughter.

Sometimes there's an episode where this character shows up, and the other characters have "grown up", while this character hasn't, in which case they may be introduced as someone's old friend.

Often this can be the fratbro or hard-drinking party girl, but sometimes it's the quiet one who suddenly leaps out of his or her shell.

Contrast with lampshade wearing, which is just someone killing the party.

Unfortunately, despite our best intentions, trying to be this in real life generally backfires and ends in either humiliation or disdain from peers (or both).
