An extreme version of wouldn't hit a girl that extends to actually killing people.

For some reason an otherwise very good fighter can't kill or harm certain people — usually due to a freudian excuse, a curse, or some other prohibition — and this is almost always a gateway for this weakness to be used against them. If this fact is introduced early on, it's usually a chekhov's gun and will almost certainly be used sometime in the story.

Generally, if the person affected by selective slaughter is a villain the flaw exploitation is treated as ingenious on the part of the heroes, but if the person is the hero, it's considered low. Yeah, a bit of a double standard. This very often results in a go through me scenario.
