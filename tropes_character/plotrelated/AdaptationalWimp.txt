The character used to be so cool. They might not have been a true bonafide badass, but at the very least they were strong and capable of standing on their own. Then the work was remade by new writers, possibly in an entirely new medium and everything changed. The once awesome action girl is now a damsel in distress. The badass bookworm is now just a plain old nerd. The action survivor is now just the drag-along, or worse.

This character has been the victim of Adaptational Wimpification. Just to be clear, as with the inverse trope adaptational badass, this is not about characters who simply suffered a minor power decrease, or had their most badass moment cut from the adaptation. This is also not the case when a retcon decides the character did not get the girl or something similar. This is specifically for those characters who went from actually useful to... decidedly less so.

Contrast adaptational badass. Compare badass decay, chickification, and took a level in dumbass, for when the character becomes a wimp within the original work. Is often a symptom of adaptation decay. Often happens in the case of a hidden badass character who isn't fully understood by the new writers.

Not to be confused with wimpification, which is a yaoi genre specific variant of this which occurs in slash fics, most often of the hurt/comfort fic variety.

Particularly awful cases of this have been known to cause an ink stain adaptation.

As always, however, remember that tropes are tools. This trope can be (and often is) invoked on purpose in order to tone down an invincible hero or invincible villain, thereby adding more suspense and drama to the work. Resist complaining about shows you don't like or screaming that something is ruined forever.
