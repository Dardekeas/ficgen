Term used in roleplaying game circles for a player - often literally the DM's girlfriend, sometimes a younger family member - who is getting special treatment from the gamemaster due to an out-of game personal relationship, specifically because the GM either wants to curry favor with them or is afraid of incurring their ire. This is often at the expense of other players, who showed up at the table to participate equally, but have somehow ended up playing sidekicks to the Dungeon Master's Girlfriend.

This trope is much older than, and not limited to gaming situations, though. Before there were RPGs, it was a situation that would arise in theatre, film, and TV â€” the director would give his girlfriend a large or important role, or a producer would insist that his current girlfriend be given a part as a condition for his backing. In most cases, she is not competent enough to handle the role; in some, she's not competent at all.

This is not a trope about someone that does something only because their significant other is doing it, though the situations do often overlap (sometimes the favoritism is in place to go easy on this new player).

In case of roleplay, the girlfriend or sibling might actually have an advantage by knowing the DM better than the other players without any favoritism coming into play.

Compare nepotism. This person may be regarded as something of a yoko oh no, especially in the case of film and music, and also may result in the love makes you uncreative trope being invoked.
