machine empathy is the trope where a character can diagnose the state of a machine just by its "feel", such as how it vibrates or the noises it makes. Comparisons between the machine and a living person are often invoked. Unlike the technopath, no supernormal abilities are involved; a character develops machine empathy simply from firsthand experience or knowledge of the hardware.

This is a popular talent for mr. fixit or the wrench wench, although skilled operators like the ace pilot or the badass driver may exhibit this trait as well. It's also a convenient excuse for why a well-placed smack instantly resolves the plot-driven breakdown.

Contrast with technopath, the phlebotinum-enhanced version of this trope. Also see techno wizard and walking techfix.
