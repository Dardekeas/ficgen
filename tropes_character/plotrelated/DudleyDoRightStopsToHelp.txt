A character is on the run. Very likely, he's been part of a stern chase from the word go. The logical course of action would be to do whatever he has to do, while drawing the least amount of attention to himself he possibly can.

he won't consider it for a moment. That random stranger over there needs help, and he won't stand idly by for the sake of anonymity.

Often leads to detection by the people he's been evading all this time, but not as often as you'd think. This trope is why a good aligned character will always blow his cover when infiltrating a wretched hive. Depending on what the outcome is, it may result in a big damn heroes moment.

Named after Dudley Do-Right, of course. helping granny cross the street is the definitive, clich√© example of this trope.

Closely related to honor before reason. See also samaritan syndrome. A subtrope of the drifter and chronic hero syndrome, and supertrope of inconvenient hippocratic oath. When done wrong, can be a form of hero ball or stupid good. Compare knight errant. dick dastardly stops to cheat is the villainous version.
