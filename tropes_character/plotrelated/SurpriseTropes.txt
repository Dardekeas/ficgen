Tropes about characters not getting what they expected. (Hope that doesn't shock you too much.)

One of the most useful emotions in a writer's toolbox and so one of the commonest in all sorts of stories.

See also betrayal tropes, plot twist, twist ending. Tropes in those indices will not be covered here.
