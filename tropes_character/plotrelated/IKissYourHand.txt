A male character takes the hand of a woman (often his love interest) and kisses it as a mark of respect. Used to portray the man as particularly romantic, chivalrous, foreign, or just old-fashioned.

In modern times this can come across as rather creepy, especially if the guy doesn't know the woman very well. For this reason, it is sometimes done by sleazy villains in order to show up the less 'cultured' hero. In such cases, a genre savvy lady will occasionally be seen to withdraw her hand before it can be kissed or even making it awkward for the man to try by offering her hand palm sideways, thumb up, fingers straight as if to insist on only a handshake.

Does not usually qualify as a first kiss (or a last kiss for that matter), but may if the character is depicted so reserved this is the deepest expression of emotion he will allow. May therefore be a case of anywhere but their lips.

When a character kisses his own hand, it's a kissing warm up. When the hand is only the beginning, it's kiss up the arm. Contrast with i kiss your foot.
