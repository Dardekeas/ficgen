Not So Stoic is what happens when a Stoic is pushed to the edge, and falls off. This is when the stoic loses his/her façade and shows the world (or just their true companions) that they aren't an emotionless automaton. They may be good at hiding it but they feel just as much as the rest of us. Likely to be very heartwrenching or extremely terrifying or both.

In order to qualify, the show of emotion must be a significant one, not just a small smile or subtle frown. This emotion need not be a "negative" one: manly tears over the death of a teammate are certainly un-stoic, but so is unfettered joy over their return.

These outpourings of emotion usually happen only a few times throughout the series — if the stoic is showing emotion every other episode in every season, then they aren't much of a stoic. However, these moments can also be used to illustrate a character's growth towards becoming more open to others, in which case displays of emotion — overt and subtle — would become more frequent over time.

Compare with not so above it all, ooc is serious business and sugar and ice personality. Contrast with bad dreams (where the stoic can keep it buttoned up — while awake), rage breaking point.

When played for laughs or poorly written, it's an out-of-character moment.
