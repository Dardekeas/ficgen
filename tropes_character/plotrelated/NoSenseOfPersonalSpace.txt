Some people can be very friendly. Very, very uncomfortably friendly.

It isn't just that they tend to stand too close when they're talking to people â€” it's that they're practically on them. You may even be complete strangers, but that doesn't stop them from hanging off of you and breathing your CO during the conversation, whether you like it or not. It doesn't help that they tend to get... er, grabby.

Somebody with no sense of personal space may keep their targets of uncomfortable closeness down to one person, or they might be like this with everyone. The character might be a cloudcuckoolander that just doesn't know better, or they may just really, really like you (or everyone), and just don't let some bothersome "social etiquette" get in the way of it. Then again, they just might be trying to get you riled up for shits and giggles. This tendency usually comes with inappropriate uses of first name basis.

Anime characters with no sense of personal space love to implement the glomp as their favored tactic. For best results, have them latch onto someone that hates being touched. It can also a be good source of ho yay, foe yay, or les yay. Depending on context this behavior may get a character labeled a memetic molester by the fandom. Compare cuddle bug.

Not to be confused with the personal space invader, which deals with grabby mooks in video games.
