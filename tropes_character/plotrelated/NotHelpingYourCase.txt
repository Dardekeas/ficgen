A character is widely distrusted, or maybe even actively disliked, by everyone else in the plot. Even though he's always innocent, this person is blamed for things that he didn't do, and is often the first suspect when something bad does happen.

Unfortunately, rather than make an effort to convince people of his innocence and good intentions, the character rebels and acts out, sometimes feeling he has nothing to lose by doing so; maybe even committing an actual crime in the process. When people discover the crime, that confirms their suspicions and "proves" to them that, yes, this person was really that bad all along.

For added ironic flavour, the newly-criminal character may be busted just as the others come around and start to believe his original claim — giving the cynic of the group something to snark about — "Well I guess you're right chumps, he really isn't a thief... he's just a graverobber."Compare i resemble that remark. Somewhat related are you have to believe me (a character tries to prove their sanity by screaming incoherent gibberish), digging yourself deeper (the character tries to sound less creepy by justifying the original creepy remark), then let me be evil (the character decides to live down to people's low expectations), and sticky fingers (habitual petty theft puts the character under a constant aura of suspicion). Contrast with wrongful accusation insurance, where the character is not implicated for crimes committed while trying to clear his name. The tropes may overlap, though, if the character is called out for his crimes as they happen, yet unceremoniously pardoned after his name is cleared. Not to be confused with don't shoot the message.
