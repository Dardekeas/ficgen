Mr Neat/Tidy/Law-Abiding/By-The-Book forced to work/live with Mr Messy/Slob/Zany/Risk-Taker/Plays-By-His-Own-Rules. Despite the name, they're usually not a romantic couple (though this depends on the show in question).

The couple might be cops.

The original odd couple were  a sitcom based on a movie based on a play of the same title, about two divorcees, neat freak Felix Unger and his sloppy friend Oscar Madison, having to live together.

If the pair lives in a high fantasy realm, a Hidden World of Awesome, or an Absurdist World of Awesome, you may be watching a psychedelic comedy bromance.

If it's not the two main characters, it's an odd friendship.
