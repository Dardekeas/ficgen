Knuckle Cracking happens when a character cracks his or her knuckles to show that he or she is ready to deal out a whuppin' or tackle a challenge. Frequently used as an intimidation tactic in fights, this is a particularly effective way of showing that the stoic is bothered enough by someone to get serious. Cracking knuckles may also be sign that a character is ready to get to work on a particularly arduous task, especially one that requires a lot of muscle.

Sometimes the knuckle cracking sound is removed, maybe for the sake of realism, maybe because some people find it too squicky and then it will be replaced by the hero crushing something in his hand. Bonus points if its made out of metal, points removed if its only a paper note.

Sometimes other joints are cracked as well, most often in the neck. Cracking joints in the shoulders or back provides a convenient excuse to flex your muscles and show off your powerful physique.
