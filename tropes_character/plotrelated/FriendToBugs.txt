Typically, the friend to all living things archetype will gloss over bugs' status as living things, so it's often expected that only a bug will be a friend to a bug. Not always, though. A character that is a friend to bugs adores even (or perhaps especially!) the insects, like a pet owner adores a pet.

Because this involves being affectionate toward creepy-crawlies, the unstoppable force of the stereotype that women hate bugs meets the immovable object of the expectation that guys aren't affectionate toward animals. The result is that this trope tends to be gender-neutral but rare.

Not to be confused with beetle mania and/or bug catching, which explicitly describe interest and collection but not necessarily endearment. also not to be confused for being friends with a certain cartoon rabbit.
