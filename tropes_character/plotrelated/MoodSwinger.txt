A character whose personality isn't marked by any set mood, but by their tendency to swing between moods drastically. Sometimes (if the characters around them are lucky) there's some sort of warning of an impending mood swing — or at least a recognizable cause — but there may just as easily be no warning whatsoever.

Frequently this is combined with emotional lability, so they skip any emotion that isn't extreme. They're never just happy, they're the cheeriest genki girl in the world. They're never just sad; they're on the verge of suicide. They're never just angry; they're filled with unstoppable rage. And they can flip between any of them at a moment's notice. May very well be a one-person four-temperament ensemble.

Though they may be referred to as "bipolar", their mood swings are generally much more abrupt and frequent than the periods of mania or depression associated with real-life bipolar disorder. This can, however, be a facet of borderline personality disorder. We have our own useful notes on bipolar disorder as well.

This is a stereotypical trait of women who are currently menstruating or suffering from pms. It is truth in television, and fairly common at that, but not typically as extreme as fiction portrays it to be nor as universal. Also, not every woman whose mood is affected by menstrual hormones will be susceptible to every mood; some get stuck swinging into one mood and temporarily become a fragile flower or acquire a hair-trigger temper. Since the same hormones are involved, pregnant women are also known for being mood swingers.

The Mood Swinger as a love interest frequently fills the role of the tsundere. This is also a common trait of the caligula.

For even more extreme cases, see hair-trigger temper, split personality, jekyll & hyde, tsundere and yandere. Not to be confused with mood whiplash, which is a trait of the storytelling, not an individual character.
