A character who has some sort of obsession with cleanliness as a character trait. It may be a sign of their dedication, obsessiveness, or perfectionism. Generally they'll be one of the few main characters to complain about neatness, unless someone ends up covered in gunge or something extremely messy.

This is stereotypical behavior for any character with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In older movies and shows, an obsession with cleanliness can be a metaphor for homosexuality in men. Women who are extremely tidy are usually shown as frigid neurotics who probably deny their husbands sex and their children unconditional love.

This is obviously truth in television.

For the opposite behavior see men can't keep house, trash of the titans, and the pig pen. See also spring cleaning fever, terrified of germs.
