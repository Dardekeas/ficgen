A character who speaks with a deep, throaty rasp, characteristic of Chain Smokers. This style of speaking gives the character an ominous or solemn tone, so it's usually the domain of anti heroes, protagonists of darker and edgier works, and villains.Often overlaps with evil sounds raspy and evil sounds deep (but not always).

For music, see harsh vocals for the use of growled vocals and basso profondo for someone whose voice is simply extremely low. May also be half of a soprano and gravel duet.
