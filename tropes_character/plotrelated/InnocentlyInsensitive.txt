This character picks on the short girl for being short. He'll ask a woman for her age. He'll bug the flamboyant guy about his sexuality. And the worst part is, he doesn't realize what he's doing is rather painful for the person on the receiving end of the criticism. In the worst cases, he might not stop at one insult and even continue until someone forces him to stop, or the other person runs away crying. (His reaction to this is probably: "Huh? What did I do?")

What separates him from the jerkass is that this person is actually a good guy - he's just clueless to things that people might generally be sensitive to. To him, it was just a fun joke or an honest assessment - no offense intended. When others bring up the fact that what he's saying is hurting other people's feelings, he tries to change.

The idiot hero is prone to this. They tend to receive replies like you know i'm black, right? and i'm standing right here. innocent bigot is a subtrope. When this is done intentionally, they're a deadpan snarker. Obviously guilty of frequently committing a fee fi faux pas. It may also be the result of a crazy cultural comparison or a cross cultural kerfuffle. Compare horrible judge of character.

A frustrating truth in television. Especially with people who have been by assholes for so much of their lives that such behavior becomes routine and mundane to them.
