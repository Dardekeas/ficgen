A case of misaimed fandom... possibly with justification. A character who is supposed to be a villain draws our natural sympathies over the so-called hero.

Possible reasons include:

      The  The villain is  The villain gets their  The reasons you must sympathize with the heroes carry    The Compare with strawman has a point, where you don't so much gain sympathy for the antagonists as lose it for the protagonists.

This can sometimes cause a bit of realism to come into it because, after all, different people have different standards.

Note: The "un" part of the title is important here. Characters only belong on these lists if they were intended for the audience not to like them. Sometimes the writer(s) intend for the villain to be sympathetic; this would entail cry for the devil.

The opposite of this trope is unintentionally unsympathetic. When a character is written that way, those who are meant to be viewed unfavorably for opposing them tend to be unintentionally sympathetic.
