a character that used to be fat, but now isn't.Sometimes, part of a character's personality is driven by the fact that they were once overweight. Having a thin character revealed to have once been fat can tell you plenty about them. It can tell you that they have a past they aren't proud of and that they care enough about their health and appearance to do something about it. It also shows that the character has the strength and will power to take control of their life and get what they want, that they have self-discipline and motivation.

Be that as it may, a formerly fat background is not always all sunshine and rainbows. It can also imply a lot of self loathing and damaged self esteem, too. Many times, their slim-down can be a symptom of a desperate need to be accepted by society and an unhealthy dependence on what others think of them. The positive and negative attitudes are not mutually exclusive either, leading to many Formerly Fat individuals to have complicated self-images.

Whenever a celebrity loses weight, expect an internet backdraft over whether they looked better before or after, with plenty of size-shaming getting tossed in both directions.

For the inverse of this trope, see formerly fit.
