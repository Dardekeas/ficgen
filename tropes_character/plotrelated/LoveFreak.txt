Often spouting dialogue about love and justice, this character is naive and lacks common sense; her determination is usually the only thing keeping her from being completely incompetent (even if she is potentially very powerful). She can also act a little hypocritical, being as sneaky or outright violent as the wickedness she supposedly fights.

How satirically this character is portrayed depends on the mood and personality of the lead, although writers design her to be somewhat sympathetic. Nonetheless, it is difficult for the other characters to really dislike her, because she is honestly nice and a loyal friend.

Somewhat like the all-loving hero, but not as charismatic or as effective, placing this character in a supporting role 99 percent of the time. May admire the knight templar at first and continue to do so if the Templar is not portrayed negatively.

See also the pollyanna, na√Øve everygirl, stupid good. Occasionally has problems if they're forced to be a reluctant warrior.

Not to be confused with the other type of Love Freak.
