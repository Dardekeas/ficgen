A character who does not appear for much of, if not all the plot, but whose presence is nevertheless felt. More accurately, the absence of the character is most significant. These works show what effect their absence has on the world and the characters. The character, in his absence, pulls strings or drives action, becoming a sort of macguffin or shadowy influence.

In short, the character drives the plot despite his or her absence either directly or through the minds and hearts of the characters. This is usually done in a few ways:

 The character is absent for the main part of the film, but subtly guides the characters' actions, and then reappears later.

 The character appears in the first part in the movie, and then dies or disappears, leaving the characters to carry on their memory.

 The character's actions or ideals, or the circumstances surrounding their death or disappearance, have repercussions and effects that last long after their death.

Compare the unseen. A posthumous character is influential despite being dead and the cynicism catalyst because of it. The opposite of this is chuck cunningham syndrome and forgotten fallen friend.
