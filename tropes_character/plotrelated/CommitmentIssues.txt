A character with commitment issues does not want to settle down with a love interest. They may think that being married is inherently boring and unadventurous, or they believe they're still not old enough to be serious yet, or they have issues stemming from observing the dysfunctional relationship their parents had, or being a swinger is just too much fun, or maybe they're really 700 years old and are afraid that by committing they'll outlive the person they love.

Whatever the reason, don't expect them to jump into a relationship upgrade anytime soon.

the "i love you" stigma is a sub-trope and common symptom of this problem. Compare insecure love interest, where the love interest's damage is specifically they don't think themselves worthy, runaway bride (which may or may not be the end result of this trope) and the ditherer who cannot be complied with any kind of commitment, showing immaturity. truth in television for a lot of people. Has nothing to with commitment anxiety, which is about the fear of starting a long runner.
