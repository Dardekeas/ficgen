Two characters or groups initially appear to be quite similar, possibly so similar as to be practically interchangeable. As the work develops, however, it becomes clear that the similarity is only superficial. Their deeper characteristics, such as motives, morals, or methods, are quite dissimilar. They may fill roughly the same role in the story, but they are far from interchangeable. If another character comments on the similarities, one or both of those being compared may respond along the lines of "What? I'm nothing like him!" before listing the differences.

Common cases include cloning blues, shadow archetype and legacy character.

cast speciation is a subtrope that applies only when the characters are part of a small cast of characters. The inversion, when characters who appear to be very different turn out to be quite similar, is not so different.
