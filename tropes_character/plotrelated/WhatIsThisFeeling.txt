So you have a character who's usually defined by a certain mood. Maybe they're always calm and inexpressive, or cheery and upbeat, or brimming with rage, or moping; whatever it is, this mood defines them to the audience and the cast. But every once in a while the planets align and something happens that brings this person a momentary change of heart. This can come as a shock to the audience, the rest of the cast, and sometimes even the character himself! They were so used to their normal state of mind and they're not sure what's going on when that smile starts to spread across their face or their eye starts to twitch in that odd way. They can only ask - "what is this feeling?"

Bound to happen at least once to any emotionless girl and in the defrosting ice queen scenario.

For specific types of feelings that can evoke this, see what is this thing you call love?, and is this what anger feels like?.

Compare not so stoic.
