So this guy hasn't seen his childhood friend in a long time. Then they meet again, and she's absolutely stunning. He realizes that his friend that he never thought of "that way" really can be thought of "that way," usually as she starts dating someone else. If he gets her in the end, it will invariably be revealed that she had been in love with him all along; she just needed a new hairstyle and contacts for him to finally notice her.

A variant of this: the first story part, they're so-so to okay looking. Cue the sequel, and BAM! knockout. There are various reasons for this; sometimes the character was too young to be thought of "that way" in the first part. In live action shows and movies, this can happen to a character when puberty hits the actor or actress like a colony drop.

This is truth in television for many girls in their early teens, though it's not often addressed in TV or movies, where girls are absolutely ecstatic about their physical changes and the (male) attention it gets them. This can happen for a variety of reasons.

Despite the trope's name, it is hardly an always female trope and gender flips are pretty common.

Contrast with lolicon, and i was quite a looker. This can sometimes lead to first girl wins. This sometimes overlaps with she cleans up nicely. Might happen to a kid hero all grown up.
