Sometimes, the course of human evolution can lead to a sub-division. Those in the position of power become a higher caste of human beings, and those in the working class are albinos with leech-like mouths who have a taste for human flesh. The latter is due to adapting to living underground becoming a troglofaunal species. Darwin didn't really think about this possibility, but H.G. Wells certainly did.

Common in science fiction and fantasy, the morlocks usually represent everything that science and art cannot redeem in the working class. This is a somewhat insidious remnant of Victorian phrenology and its ideas of evolutionary levels, and has left a huge impact in genre fiction.

the morlocks as a trope are almost always chaotic evil. They are often the byproduct of a sufficiently advanced Society.

The name of this trope stems from The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. The Morlocks are hideous troll-like beings that haunt the night while the innocent Eloi culture sleeps. The book implies that it is kind of a blue and orange morality: the Eloi have no conception of altruism, art, love or even the future tense. They don't actually have a culture. The Morlocks, on the other hand, are actually productive society members: they just breed the Eloi like cattle, and for the same purpose. The narrator speculates that, as the upper class constantly pushed the lower class below ground, the upper class lost the ability to think and work for itself, leaving the lower class adapted to operating heavy machinery and thinking logically. The entire thing is commonly interpreted as a critique on Victorian society.

This concept has since evolved into a monster archetype much like vampires and zombies but hasn't been overused like those tropes.
