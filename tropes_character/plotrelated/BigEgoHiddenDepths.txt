The character with a small name, big ego is the focus of the episode, and in the end his pretensions and facades are broken down to reveal a usually insecure and hurt individualâ€”or in some cases, a truly caring person who hides behind his behavior because he is unable to express love/affection.

Usually, the last thing the character does at the end of the episode is restore his full character, so the viewer can go back to seeing him in the same stock way, but with an added understanding of the character's hidden depth. Can also be a key component of said character's transformation into a jerk with a heart of gold.
