In some stories, a character is very different every time they appear — so different that it's almost a different character with the same name. This is particularly common with long runners and comic books, due to the large number of writers on staff. But there are some characters where even the same writer makes them different every time.

This is not the same as character development — nothing happens in the story to justify the personality change. writer on board or creator breakdown might, though.

Don't get this confused with character depth. Just because you can't predict a character's moves 100% of the time doesn't mean they're inconsistent. Now, if you can predict a character's moves 100% of the time only when you know who's writing, then they're definitely inconsistent.

Different writers with different ideas and understandings of the work are also the usual culprit of continuity drift.

If the writers themselves begin to notice this, they might attempt an author's saving throw. If they can find a way to plausibly reconcile the two depictions, it may even lead to genuine character development, acknowledging that real people are complex and full of apparent contradictions.
