Chances are, being fat in fiction means you're a disgusting slob who leaves food crumbs everywhere, kicks your feet up on the table and treat the place like a low-budget buffet, talk while eating, and have food flying out of your (greasy) clothing.

Generally played as always male. This character's distaff counterpart is "the fat girl".

Folks like this are usually bad guys, but not always. If they're on the good guys' side, however, it's almost always a case of good is not nice. Most guys like this are incompetent and lazy, but not all of them; a few genius slobs and acrofatic types may be included.

For more stereotypical behaviors of the obese, compare and contrast fat bastard, fat idiot, jabba table manners and fat, sweaty southerner in a white suit. Contrast big beautiful woman and big beautiful man, who are fat and attractive in spite (or because) of their girth. Another positive contrast is big fun, for people who are hefty, yet portrayed as chipper and friendly.
