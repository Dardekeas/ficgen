Specialization is a common trend in fiction. It allows the author to create an ensemble cast where every member of a team provides a specific function, and avoids role duplication.

Not always, however.

Perhaps a character is a loner, and needs to be able to do everything on his own. Perhaps everyone else is just so useless, he had to take over their jobs as well as his own. Perhaps he just has a wide variety of interests. May be a sign of a person with a checkered past, who has had to take on a lot of roles in his life, just to get by. Whatever the reason, this character has at least some skill in a wide variety of disciplines.

Sometimes the leader of a group may actually be a Jack-Of-All-Trades, with a good, basic grasp of the specialized skills possessed by the members of his team, allowing him to understand how to use each team member to their fullest potential.

Supertrope of renaissance man (where someone is exceptionally good at many things) and master of none (where someone is not very good at a lot of things). A related trope found in video games and tabletop games is the jack of all stats, who has well-balanced stats, not skills.
