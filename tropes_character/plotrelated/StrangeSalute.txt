exactly what it says on the tin, a strange salute is simply an idiosyncratic greeting gesture featured in a piece of fiction. While understandably most common in mildly military series, a strange salute can pop up anywhere, at any time, provided that it is both common and codified enough to go beyond a mere single oddity.

Note that this trope covers only strictly fictional salutes, saluters and/or salutees. If those wacky nazis set their right arms straight at a 45-degree-angle above the horizontal (and slightly to the right) to greet adolf hitler in a wartime cartoon, it's certainly a salute - one some might even find strange - but not a strange salute. Now, on the other hand, if it were scary dogmatic aliens doing the same thing to the big bad in a space opera, well, well...

For the more general version, see memetic hand gesture.
