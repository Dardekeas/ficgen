When a character grows into a jerkass over time (sometimes not much of it at all). Can be due to flanderization, a face-heel turn, or just another regular albeit unfortunate case of character development. While a jerk ass growing into a jerk with a heart of gold is a common phenomenon, especially in dramas, a reversal, resulting in this trope, is also common, especially in comedies.

This can also cause tropes like what the hell, hero?, though whether if the character changes for the better after that is well depending on the writer. If the transition is shown as a flashback regarding a known jerk/villain, it may be a start of darkness.

See also took a level in badass, took a level in dumbass, cynicism catalyst and jumping off the slippery slope. When a character has this temporary for the sake of the plot, the jerkass ball is present. The counter trope to took a level in kindness. Contrast bitch in sheep's clothing, who was always a jerk. A character taking his/her level in jerkassitude was genuinely nice. When a character becomes more of a jerk in an adaptation, that's adaptational villainy.
