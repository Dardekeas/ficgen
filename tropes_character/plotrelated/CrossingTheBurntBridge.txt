So you're never going to see those assholes again? Sweet.

Time to let them know what you really think of them! Tell the ex-girlfriend off, insult the constant jerk, rob the old neighbor, leave a surprise on the boss's desk, jack their last ice cream sandwich, whatever fits! They deserve it, and you're never going to have to live through the repercussions anyway.

Wait, what's that? You have a class with that ex? The jerk is your mentor's kid? You aren't moving or transferring after-all? You left your wallet in their freezer when you were stealing the ice cream sandwich?

Oh, hell.

This is when a character issues a so long, suckers!, expecting never to have to see the people they offend ever again, only to be forced to continue their acquaintance. Or even worse, seek their help. So now, they have to be on their best behavior, put up with all the same crap, and/or face the music for what they did, deserved or not.

May overlap with off the table, when the other party refuses to allow the bridge to be rebuilt.

Compare we meet again, we will meet again, where it all began, my god, what have i done?, the exit is that way, who's laughing now? and take this job and shove it.
