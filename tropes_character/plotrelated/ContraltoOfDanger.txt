The distaff counterpart to badass baritone: If a female character's voice is noticeably lower than those of other women in the work, it's a sure sign that she either is a lot more dangerous than they or is more masculine. As such, contralto voices are usually reserved for tough action girls, tomboys, lad-ettes, ladies of war, bifauxnen, and femme fatales.

Some female characters, in the meantime, may go from a higher-pitched voice to a menacing contralto when they're about to kick someone's ass, or during changes of their persona when the character gets serious. A common reason for a change in persona is for the character to tap into some mystical power. Being taken over by her super-powered evil side could be another reason for this since evil sounds deep. Or maybe she just gets in the zone during let's get dangerous moments and the deep voice is reflecting that.

Compare and contrast badass baritone, and women are delicate, at least when it comes to a "feminine" vs. "masculine" voice. May overlap with alto villainess and evil sounds deep.
