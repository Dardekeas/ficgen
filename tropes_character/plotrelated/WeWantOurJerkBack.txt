A common sitcom plot where the total jerk ass learns his lesson, turns sweet and benevolent — and becomes absolutely intolerable, making the other characters yearn for the original personality. Eventually the character in question will revert to normal, and the reaction will either be relief, or realization that he really is worse in his obnoxious form.

A subset of flowers for algernon syndrome. This becomes worse if the cast caused this change intentionally, because pygmalion snap back means the jerk ass returns to his jerky nature and has an ax to grind.

This can also refer to a situation where the jerk ass is replaced, much to the relief of the other characters... at first. It turns out that the replacement is either much worse, or is so nice that nobody can stand them. Luckily, the regular jerk ass will be reinstated, but nobody will ever mention this again.

Compare/contrast teach him anger — trying to teach someone already nice to be tougher. This trope has a very high chance of being a broken aesop or family-unfriendly aesop if the vice that the jerkass cured is a genuinely harmful one; what kind of friends would WANT their acquaintance to still be an alcoholic, a religious fanatic, a bully, an incompetent worker, etc. even if it means less lulz/more irritation for them? Since status quo is god, this will rarely get pointed out.

See also better the devil you know, which is when the heroes want to prevent a villain from leaving, because it would result in a worse villain replacing him.

This also has some relation to why we are bummed communism fell, where people lament the lack of a balance of power the Cold War brought.

Please be aware that examples detailing inversions of the trope shouldn't be here, take them to took a level in jerkass.
