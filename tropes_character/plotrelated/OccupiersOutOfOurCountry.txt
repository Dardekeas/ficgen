Sometimes, when writers feel the need to avert terrorists without a cause, they use this stock motivation, where the members of a guerilla/insurgent/terrorist/freedom fighter/resistance/etc. movement and/or organisation justify their actions by claiming they desire for foreign occupiers to leave their nation. This is both truth in television and older than feudalism, dating at least back to the 1st century BCE with the Sicarii zealots in Roman-occupied Israel.

A rather peculiar case of this trope occurs with some animal wrongs groups, who claim humans are occupying the Earth.
