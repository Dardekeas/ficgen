The hero is working to stop the evil plan of the evil overlord, and has, at long last, found an ally. No, wait... perhaps ally is too strong a word. This person is fighting the big bad, just like the hero, but is doing so on their own terms with their own agenda. This agenda doesn't run contrary to the hero's, but at the same time the other person's agenda doesn't fall seamlessly in line with the hero's goals, either.

This so-called "ally" isn't overly concerned with the hero's welfare, or whether or not the hero succeeds in his mission. He or she isn't actively out to hurt the hero, it's just that they would happily betray the hero to the bad guy if it means that one of their schemes succeeded. But as long as the hero is of use to them, they'll help out when they can. They aren't necessarily malicious... they just have a mission of their own they are attending to.

Occasionally, the "ally" will actually be another villain, who, for some reason, has decided that helping the hero is beneficial to his own long-term goals. Often, this is part of a xanatos gambit; if they can use the hero to do some dangerous dirty work then why not? They either accomplish a goal or lose a potential enemy. It's win-win.

Expect the phrase "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" to be used, a sentiment that is quite often proven false in such situations.

Compare divided we fall where genuine allies fight, and contrast enemy mine where the above sentiment proves true. Not the mole, but may as well be. Often involves a reliable traitor.
