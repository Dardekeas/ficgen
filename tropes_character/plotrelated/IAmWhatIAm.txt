Often a character will have an aspect of himself of which he's ashamed (or that society insists he should be). It might have something to do with his heritage, such as being illegitimately born, half-demon or some other inheritance considered unfortunate by society. It might have something to do with his lifestyle; e.g., if he's gay or geeky, or he collects belly button lint. Maybe he was forced into an emergency transformation which he can't undo, and he's been bemoaning "what have i become?" Or maybe it's an obstacle he faces, like being handicapped, dyslexic or incapable of thinking rationally. Could even be a matter of love. Whatever the issue is, expect the character at some point to receive an epiphany that leads to him embracing whatever makes him different.

Often leads to a moment of awesome, an aesop or both. If in a musical, expect a whole song to be given over to this, and it may be a dark or triumphant reprise of the "i want" song. May result in a character repairing broken mirrors and defaced pictures of themselves. Due to its nature as a characterization trope that signals self-acceptance, confidence, and a certain degree of enlightenment, not to mention vanquishing inner demons, may be a rather spoilery trope. Where the character decides they're happy being a monster (although often dark is not evil) see fully-embraced fiend.

The trope namer is the eponymous song from La Cage aux folles. The song is by a professional drag queen who sings about how he is not ashamed of who he is, and has become very popular in the gay rights movement.

Compare it's what i do and i am not him.

Not to be confused with i am spartacus or i am who?. Or "I am Who I am", which is the best translation that scholars can find for YHWH, the name of the Judeo-Christian God.
