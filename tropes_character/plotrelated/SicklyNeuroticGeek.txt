This character is frequently seen as a sidekick to the lead, and will be a hollywood nerdly type. He will likely speak as though his nose is constantly congested, have myriad absurd allergies (and it usually is allergies, unless he needs a nerdy inhaler for his asthma) and go to equally absurd lengths to avoid any further ailments. Expect him to talk about his long list of medical issues openly and graphically whether he's asked to or not. His health issues are often implied to be psychosomatic, or hypochondria: If this character takes a level in badass, expect them to clear up pronto.

Whatever the actual level of ill health, it will be a sign of physical incompetence and social awkwardness - or at least, that's what everyone will assume.

Compare jewish complaining, drama queen.
