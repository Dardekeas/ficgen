ugly cute is what happens when a creature that isn't exactly "attractive" somehow manages to be adorable. Normally, these little guys still have some kind of stereotypical "cute" traits, like oversized eyes or a fat little body.

And then, there's these guys. They're scary, and meant to be... and they still, somehow, manage to be adorable. These little guys may sport cute little fangs, be mooks for the resident big bad, or hail from a halloween town-flavored setting.

Compare and contrast ugly cute and killer rabbit. May overlap with adorable evil minions. See also gonk.
