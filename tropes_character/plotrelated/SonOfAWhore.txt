A character whose mother is a sex worker, most likely a hooker with a heart of gold. The father was likely one of her many customers. Sometimes the character was merely raised in a brothel, without either of his/her parents working there, or being born of a sex slave. Expect either wangst or angst over their origin. More common amongst anti heroes than others. Possible heroic bastard.

don't remind him of his origin too much, because in some languages this trope name is the worst insult possible. Some could take it more calmly, however, and give the insulter a good retort; others would just smash his face in, since even bad men love their mamas. This is also commonly used as a freudian excuse to explain why a character might be rather messed up; in some works of fiction, characters whose mothers were sex workers have a high rate of becoming serial killers (although there's usually some other form of abuse involved as well).

For some reason, this character is almost always male, even though a sex worker's offspring is just as likely to be female. If the character is a Daughter of a Whore, there's the additional baggage that she is expected to follow in her mother's footsteps, which is highly likely to be a berserk button for the character in question.

See also single mom stripper. This character may be a heroic bastard, a bastard bastard, or anywhere in between.
