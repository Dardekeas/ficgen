You are doing your duty â€” you know it, you have been instructed from childhood in how to behave properly. Or perhaps you are just listening to something that was done. Properly.

So why do you feel like it was dirty business? It is inexplicable, even stunning and shocking, to feel this way about your duty.

The commonest cause is that the evil being done is to someone outside the purported scope of moral myopia. Although association with such people can trigger it, it is not required. Others may arise when a character raised to never give a sucker an even break feels guilty about cheating, or other times when cunning appears despicable.

Can lead to a screw the rules, i'm doing what's right or a curious heel realization where the character thinks he is becoming a Heel, but the audience thinks he is repudiating it.
