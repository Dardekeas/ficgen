Sometimes, it takes paragraph after paragraph to get an idea on what kind of a person you're dealing with. Sometimes characters are so complex, so deep and nuanced, that an entire episode is devoted to some esoteric part of their back story.

And sometimes you can figure out everything you need to know about someone as soon as they get into their car. Taste in music, especially when it's out of the ordinary, can tell you more about a character than a monologue or flashback ever could. A little well-placed Mozart or Chopin lends an outwardly simple-minded individual a bit of mystery and depth. Someone listening to the Beatles, even though it's 2237, and he's on Mars? Safe to say he's a bit old-fashioned. And if they listen to 80s rock, they may become a victim of ac/dc Characterization...

Music can convey a lot more than just what's in the lyrics, so matching this song with that character, while a bit of a cheat, is a fantastic way to convey a lot about a character in not a lot of time. This also does wonders to convey a deeper side to a character that can easily be considered one-dimensional. A mousy librarian suddenly takes on a wilder angle when her iPod is blaring Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.

This trope does not refer to a character's theme song, if they have one. This refers to diegetic music, often called source music, where the other characters can hear it.

Compare leitmotif, where a specific tune is used to signify a character.
