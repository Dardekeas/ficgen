The character gave the world their love, their care, their trust, and, in return, was somehow back-stabbed, deceived, taken advantage of, used. Some of their old optimism breaks, and they take it to heart that they should not trust others so easily. There is, however, a readjustment in expectations on how the world works towards the pessimistic, not an outright surrender, and not necessarily a change in methods either (an incorruptible character may choose to be a doomed moral victor rather than adjust their methods) or even a change in attitude (the pollyanna is perfectly aware of living in a crapsack world, yet refuses to let it bring them down), let alone a heel-face turn, as any anti-hero can attest.

A broken pedestal can result in this; in a meta sense, the character percieves all of humanity to have failed to live up to his expectations, and revises them accordingly. The cause of the event is the cynicism catalyst. The result is usually the acquisition of jade coloured glasses. Can result in a broken bird, or, worse yet, a despair event horizon.
