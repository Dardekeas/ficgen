One of the defining traits of this particular character is his movie lore. This character will compare nearly everything to a scene from a movie. While this character might be genre savvy it's not a requirement.

Additionally, the movie buff usually knows all about Oscar nominees, Oscars won, actors, directors, Emmy awards, how a movie was received, etc.

This is usually a source of pride for said character but can sometimes be a source of chagrin for the rest of the cast.

His knowledge is likely to be used for humor more often than it is used as a plot point.
