Two characters have a difficult relationship not because of their differences, but because of their similarities. This is most commonly seen between parents and children or romantic couples, but there's plenty of room for it in other relationships.

This can be a sign of latent (or not-so-latent) self-loathing; the character hates himself, so he also hates people who remind him of himself. Or it can be a matter of certain traits' needing to be complemented rather than mirrored in a relationship: someone who talks all the time and someone who would rather listen are obviously better off with each other than with partners like themselves.

See foil for a list of examples of how differing personalities can be better together. Compare opposites attract, you remind me of x, hypocritical humor, you are what you hate, turn out like his father, evil parents want good kids, your approval fills me with shame, doppelganger dating. Contrast birds of a feather.
