A sub-trope of the odd couple wherein the odd couple are twins, usually identical brothers or sisters. A prominent exception is actually in the former trope namer, The Patty Duke Show. It featured identical cousins, who were described as "One pair of matching bookends, different as night and day" in the expository theme tune.

Basically, sibling yin-yang for (usually identical) twins. They'll usually embrace using identical twin id tags to help the differentiation.

Sometimes overlaps with cain and abel, in which case you might expect fearful symmetry. Also frequently overlaps with foolish sibling, responsible sibling.

Extreme opposite is single-minded twins or creepy twins.
