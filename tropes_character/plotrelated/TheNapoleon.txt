The natural counterpart to the gentle giant. While the gentle giant is large and kind-hearted, the Napoleon is hot-blooded, aggressive and short. This character comes in a variety of flavors: they might be physically belligerent or merely pushy; they might be compensating for their lack of height by acting "big", or it might just be an incidental part of their character. By and large, small things are acceptable targets, so expect the Napoleon to be a villain or the butt monkey.

The name comes from "Napoleon complex" (popularly known as "short-man syndrome"), an inferiority complex said to be suffered by short people. Aggressive or dangerous people who are short are often labeled as such to mock them. This was most famously done to the legendary French emperor, napoleon bonaparte. Although Napoleon was of average height for his nationality and time period, a number of different factors created the widely held urban legend that he was quite shortâ€”mostly stemming from a discrepancy between English and French measurement systems that got lost in translation. English propaganda of the time seized on the perception and portrayed him as comically short to deflate his image.

See mister big for when a vertically-challenged person is head of a criminal organisation. Compare a-cup angst, when a female character feels inferior due to a lack of outward growth. Napoleons might use a scully box to appear taller.

Not to be confused with napoleon delusion.
