Your otherwise capable or serious character has an inordinate fear of thunderstorms. This is a primal, almost childish fear that surprises other characters, although it's not always played for laughs. The actual name of this fear is "Brontophobia" or "Astraphobia."  It also happens to animals, especially dogs.

This trope in real life is older than feudalism, with the fear of thunder being a prime defining weakness of the gaius julius caesar and the Julio-Claudian dynasty of Ancient Rome.

Note that fear of thunder is often treated as silly; after all, it's just a lot of noise. Fear of lightning, on the other hand, is absolutely justified — and confirmed by Snopes — but by the same token, since you hear the thunder after the lightning, it's good news: it means you weren't hit.

A subtrope of why did it have to be snakes?, especially common in anime. Would be logical in settings with dramatic thunder, but the tropes seldom combine.
