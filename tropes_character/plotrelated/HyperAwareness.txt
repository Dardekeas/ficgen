No detail escapes the notice of our character. With only a brief sherlock scan, he can deduce intimate and accurate information about an individual. With hyper awareness, they will sit down and know how many people are in the area, what they are doing, which ones are important to the plot and what would be the best exit without attracting attention.

For example: During a stroll through a crowded casino while having an important conversation, he can notice that the woman at the outermost Baccarat table is wearing knock-off Dior, yet playing $10,000 gold plaques with abandon, left-handed, and she has a "tell" that is a slight shaking of her left foot.

Sometimes this is an element of a character's personality that has been well set up. Especially in detective / crime shows it may be the entire point of the story.

At other times, it is a new attribute that only serves the plot. It may never come up again.

Can overlap with the scarily competent tracker, living lie detector and photographic memory. Compare super senses when it is literally that their sense of hearing, sight, smell and touch are hyperactive. May be visualized with things like fluorescent footprints or a stylized bullet time stat-o-vision like readout of what they see. Contrast failed a spot check.
