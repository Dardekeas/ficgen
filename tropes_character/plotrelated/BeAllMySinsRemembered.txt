Roughly translated: "I don't deserve your praise."

This trope refers to that state of mind in a hero, an anti-hero, or possibly a villain, in which he reflects on how he is not worthy of the adulation or acclaim or status he has received. This isn't necessarily others denouncing him, or giving him inverted praise, as in Mark Antony over Caesar's body. This is where he either thinks or overtly says something like, "I am not worthy" or "I've done terrible things [to get here]". He may not regret the actions himself, but typically he regrets having to take the action. the idea is that he was either forced, through circumstances or personal weakness to do terrible things.sub-trope of dirty business.
