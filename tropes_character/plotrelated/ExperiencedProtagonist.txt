This character's story only begins (specifically at the start of the FIRST work of a series) after they have finished their training, have attained most of their power, and made a name for themselves. They may even be a living legend or be famed in story. The audience may only learn of their back story in a prequel, short flashback, or have it be mentioned orally, if they even learn of it at all. Usually the conflict they end up placed in is one specifically in their area of expertise or where their knowledge and training can be adapted to new uses.

Because the protagonist is often also the audience surrogate, they are often a newcomer to the setting and have to learn everything and develop their skills - whether for fighting or whatever else the story focuses on - from scratch. In such cases the audience surrogate may actually be a supporting character or a deuteragonist.

Contrast ordinary high-school student and farm boy, who are complete novices, rookie red ranger who is a novice compared to the others on his team, and child prodigy and skilled, but naive protagonists, who are young and inexperienced but are quick learners. Contrast the mentor, who is experienced and skilled but is usually tasked with teaching the protagonist, rather then being one themselves.

Note that for video game characters, even if they are touted as being experienced or powerful, the trope is functionally averted if their level and abilities in the game are ordinary and average. If this is the case, such examples go under overrated and underleveled.

For all examples, please list exactly what skill, training, or experience the character has when the story begins.
