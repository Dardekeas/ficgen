The process by which a badass becomes less of a badass.

A belief persists among many writers that if the audience takes a liking to a real badass who fears nothing, has infinite confidence and even carries off defeat with panache, it must mean that what they most want to see is that character reveal a vulnerable side and all manner of inner demons.

It is either that belief or the natural result of character development, where extra dimensions are added to an existing character to flesh them out and keep them fresh. Either way, the character starts out badass, and becomes less so over time.

Most often this happens through ensemble dark horse tendencies, they appear so often and are so popular that any attempt to give them greater depths results in them losing what made them so effective in the first place.

Contrast with took a level in badass. Compare with menace decay, motive decay, villain decay, and the worf effect. Compare and contrast bait the dog and moral event horizon, where a Badass character loses their cool as a result of dog kicking.

chickification is a gender-specific variant. wimpification is a yaoi genre and slash specific variant. Someone who undergoes physical Badass Decay may become a perilous old fool.

Also note that this trope applies when a badass decays within a single continuity. If an absolute badass in your favorite book is portrayed as somewhat less awesome in the film of the book, that's not this trope, it's adaptational wimp.

A reminder from your friendly neighborhood watch: tropes are not bad. In fact many of the characters on this page took a level in badass as a result of their Badass Decay.
