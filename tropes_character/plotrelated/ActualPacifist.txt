"Don't worry; I won't hurt you."That's an Actual Pacifist, in a nutshell.

He's philosophically opposed to using physical violence to any degree, for any reason. To be on this trope, that includes self-defense, and if played right, can be a very moral and ethical person. On television, he or she is in contrast to the far-more-common technical pacifist, who is fine with punching, stabbing, shooting or maiming people as long as they survive the experience.

If they absolutely have to fight, most likely in the course of protecting another, expect angst or even wangst to result. Such a situation is usually a matter of life and death. If this happens too often, they will become a reluctant warrior.

Certain religious figures and practitioners of white magic are personally bound to be an Actual Pacifist, by reason of their dedication: they may support, bless, and succor those who fight, but they will not take up arms themselves. the medic is also prone to be an Actual Pacifist, despite his common association with armies (although this is for a different reason — a combat medic COULD fight, but if he does, he's not under the protection of the geneva convention).

trying to raise a child as an actual pacifist because his father was violent or loved being in harm's way usually fails, although the child may at least be less violent than his father and willing to try peaceful means.

Some Actual Pacifists are able to circumvent their restriction via mind games, such as shaming the mob. Every rule has a loophole, after all.
