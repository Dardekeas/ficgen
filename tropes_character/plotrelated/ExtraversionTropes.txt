An Extraverted (or extroverted) character is one who tends to be right at home in a crowd of people, and generally be talkative and gregarious. They can be the life of the party or the leader of their true companions. The fact that they're right at home in a crowd is actually one of their biggest weaknesses: they may become stressed if away from people for too long.

The short version: an extravert gains energy by being in large groups of people, and expends it by being alone. They tend to be either sanguine or choleric.
