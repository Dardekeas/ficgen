A character check is when the writer realizes the character is no longer behaving the way he or she was first portrayed, and tries to cover it up by throwing in a scene in which the character ostentatiously reverts to form. Related to author's saving throw, but a character check seldom leads to any lasting change and is not necessarily popular with the fans, who may have become attached to the "new" version of the character and dislike the brief resurgence of the old one.

Very common with designated villains or jerk ass characters who have moved into jerk with a heart of gold territory; this sort of reminder of "how things used to be" is a frequent side effect of badass decay and villain decay. Also likely to result from depending on the writer. There is also a certain amount of truth in television here. Someone may have changed over time, but still fall back on old habits now and again. However, fictional characters are usually expected to behave more consistently. This trope may make the audience exclaim, "I forgot flanders could do that!"
