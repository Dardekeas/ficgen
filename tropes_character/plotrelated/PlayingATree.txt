A character is tricked into performing in a play as an inanimate object. It's often used to undermine a character, making them the chew toy of the moment. The need to have actors essentially playing props can be justified for school productions in which everyone in a class has to have something to do, and the adults in charge are forced to stretch the definitions of "actor" and "character".
