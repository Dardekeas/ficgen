Some characters are older than they look (much older, even). Some, meanwhile, are younger. Maybe they're robots, clones, some other kind of artificial construct, or just unhealthy. Maybe there's a superficial reason, such as a curse. Or they're just overdeveloped. One way or another, this character may look like an adult(/teenager/older child), and even act and talk like one, but chronologically speaking, they aren't.

Other times there may be a young adult with the appearance of a middle aged or even older man. Gray hair, a prematurely receding hairline, generally cause someone to look older. Certain types of facial hair also can make a younger man seem older.

Subtropes include older alter ego, a magical ability for younger kids to temporarily turn into adults and back, and plot-relevant age-up, the same permanently.

Similar, but not to be confused with artistic age, where this is due to art rather than in-story causes. If, in live-action, their age is surprising to the viewer but not anyone in story, it's a bad side-effect of dawson casting.

Many people will contest that this is a truth in television.

Supertrope to born as an adult. Compare compulsory school age, mistaken age, age-inappropriate dress. Contrast animation anatomy aging. Compare and contrast really seventeen years old (where someone is younger than they claim to be).
