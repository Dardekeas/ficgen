Not all heroes are fearless. Some of them are characterized by nervousness, timidity, reluctance to go anywhere near danger — all the hallmarks of a coward. Yet when push comes to shove, they will always be right there in the thick of the action, doing whatever it takes to accomplish their objective and get themselves and their teammates out alive.

Unlike took a level in badass, these characters don't get over their fearful ways after a single moment of glory. They remain scaredy-cats and/or insecure in their regular lives despite the fact that they can kick major ass when they put their minds into it. Many of them will tell everyone to think nothing of it, because they think the fear they felt trumps the heroism they performed. These characters may also be combat pragmatists who get the job done by using brains rather than brawn when they go up against enemies that outclass them and they know they'll get killed if they just charge in and attack. Typically, his closest friends know exactly what he is capable of and know they can depend on him in crises, with a little prompting of course.

Usually, inverse of miles gloriosus. Unlike the so-called coward, this character is not actually misunderstood and does not need to be viewed by other characters as cowardly; it is his own opinion that matters. (And the so-called coward may be perfectly confident in his own courage.) Unlike the accidental hero, the examples in this trope are characters that manage to get things done with their own worth, despite their fears.

Contrast the fearless fool — especially when it is invoked to encourage him. Prone to heroic self-deprecation and face your fears. See also lovable coward.
