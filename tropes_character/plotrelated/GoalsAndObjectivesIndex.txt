What are the characters trying to accomplish? Compare to motivation index which is what drives the character. While there is some overlap between goals and motivations, they are not always the same thing. Different characters may share the same goal, but have a different motivation. For example, a lawyer may be trying to clear their name for great justice, or maybe they are only in it for the money.
