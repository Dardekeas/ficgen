Some heroes take so much pride in themselves that they just can't turn a challenge down. To do so would be an affront to their personal honor. It would imply that they don't have the courage to go through with what would happen if they failed. Moreover, by showing that they lack the resolve to go through with the challenge implies that they think they'd lose. And by gosh, no hero of ours is going to be a loser!

Inevitably, though, a situation will arise that's so over-the-top that even the most headstrong character is going to think, "Maybe it isn't worth risking my life in a chainsaw-juggling contest just because I accidentally said that guy's hair looks like a mullet". It's here that only one thing has to be said to get the character to go through with the crazy scheme anyway.

"What are you? Chicken? Buk-buk!"

Of course, this doesn't always end well. Often, insulting a character's courage can end up pushing the berserk button, and the opposition will promptly get taken to the cleaners on whatever the bet was. Sometimes this is done deliberately thanks to a tricky mentor to get the hero to do something he is unlikely to do for any other reason.

By contrast, things can go very badly if the villain is deliberately manipulating the hero into doing something stupid, using the hero's pride as a means of accomplishment. Expect a great deal of evil laughing as this devious plot unfolds.

Sometimes a character doesn't like to be called a dirty coward because he actually is one. This can go one of two ways: He might chicken out at the last minute and head for the hills, making him a miles gloriosus. Or he might live up to his blustering and win the fight anyway, becoming the boast.

The inverse trope is when the character puts up with being called a chicken because deep down they really aren't one; that's the so-called coward.

Subtrope of inspirational insult. Compare fearless fool.
