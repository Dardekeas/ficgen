There are some characters who can keep a cool head no matter what. Then at the other end of the scale, there's this person. They'll be the first to panic under pressure, and heroic bsods are a common thing for them. Pessimistic by nature, they'll automatically assume the worst and worry even when everything's going right. And when the worst really does happen, they might even reduce to spouting incoherent gibberish.

Often, this character is revealed to have a painful past that left them like this. As such, this is sometimes a trait of a shrinking violet or a more emotional broken bird. Some versions of this will hide their anxiety (or at least try to) behind a cheerful facade.

Contrast the stoic, nerves of steel.
