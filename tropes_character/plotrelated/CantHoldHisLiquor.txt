People you should never, ever offer a drink to. As soon as they even taste a drop of alcohol, they either pass out (putting you in danger in case that person should really be awake) or go off the deep end. It rarely gets as far as endless vomiting or a near death experience, or anything else that usually happens after alcohol poisoning, because this is primarily a comedy trope, though it can be used in a dramatic work as well if the person in question is a particularly abusive mean drunk.

This trope is extremely common, and is most often used for comedic effect. If you need to wake him up fast, you'll need a hideous hangover cure.

May overlap with kissing under the influence, intoxication ensues, drunken master, lampshade wearing. Polar opposite of never gets drunk.

If instead the character gets intoxicated from something that's not alcoholic at all, they're drunk on milk.

Of course, this is often also a case of truth in television.
