This is where a wide-eyed idealist is psychologically beaten and broken down until they become more cynical in their views. May involve more than mind control, the piling on of various misfortunes and traumas, or simply the fact that growing up sucks, but they end up wearing jade-colored glasses.

May be a way to avoid the pain. If so, expect hope is scary if they start to recover.

the trope name is a pun on rose colored glasses and being "jaded".Supertrope of grumpy bear, silly rabbit, idealism is for kids! and silly rabbit, romance is for kids!.

Compare and contrast the knight in sour armor, a character who manages to still be an idealist despite his or her Jade Colored Glasses. Possibly related to break the cutie.

Contrast the pollyanna who is endlessly optimistic despite hardship or tragedy, and likely to tell this trope to take off the glasses because silly rabbit, cynicism is for losers!.
