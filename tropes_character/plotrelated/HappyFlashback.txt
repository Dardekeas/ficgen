A Happy Flashback is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin, a flashback to a happy time in a character's past. Frequently they have a drastically different color palette from the rest of the film/tv show in keeping with most flashbacks. It'll be very bright, warm and colorful (possibly even supersaturated with color) or almost completely white from the brightness, or in simple sepia tones with blurriness added. Then again, it might be drawn in crayon to really invoke the "good old days" feel.

The Happy Flashback is often used as a mood counterpoint in a scene that is decidedly dark. It especially helps when the entire story is very sad or even tragic because it provides a "breather" for the audience and helps avoid darkness-induced audience apathy. It's similar to comic relief, with the benefit of adding back story and helping to breathe some hope back into a character or plot. The emotional counterpoint is especially useful for storytellers since it serves to show that the character(s) aren't walking bags of angst, they can feel other emotions and the pain they feel now is all the more keen because they once were happy.

Point in fact, the Happy Flashback is almost a necessity for the troubled backstory flashback to work as well as it does; transitioning from a sugar bowl into a sugar apocalypse.
