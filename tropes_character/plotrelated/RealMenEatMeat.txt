That cow? Food. That dog? food. that grizzly bear? Food. That roadkill? Eh... food.

If you're a man, eat meat. If you don't eat meat, you're not manly. And eat red meat. Who only eats the white stuff? That's not meat; it's gotta bleed before it's meat. What are ya? Some skinny punk? a girl?

In case you haven't guessed, real men eat meat. They are obsessed about meat, and the bigger, redder, bloodier the better. They will often brag about how rare they like it; "it should moo at me!" Chicken and (most) fish barely qualify as manly meat, but if the guy is eating poultry, you can bet it's a big greasy drumstick. If it's fish, he probably got it with dynamite or it's some kind of shark. Bonus points are awarded if those items were deep fried or smothered in hot sauce (or both). The other end of the spectrum goes up to deer, bears, dinosaurs and anything bigger, depending on the setting. Bonus points if the meat is something he himself killed.

It never occurs to them that meat is simply part of a complete meal involving salad, meat, vegetables, dairy products, fruit, and this bowl of chocolate frosted sugar bombs. Also prevalent is a conviction that however much non-meat food a man eats, he'll still be hungry, for some reason.

If a girl is a carnivore, unless she's a holdout for low-carb, it's to show that she's tomboyish.

A subtrope of testosterone poisoning. Related to manly men can hunt and unrelated to large ham (although overlap is possible). bacon addiction is a sister trope.
