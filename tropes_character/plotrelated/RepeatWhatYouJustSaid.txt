Bob is talking to Alice. Alice may have a problem and be looking for inspiration to solve it; Bob engages in a long and unhelpful monologue while Alice ponders, but one of Bob's comments ignites a eureka moment. Alice promptly turns to Bob and says, "Wait. Repeat what you just said." Bob, bemused, repeats the very last thing he said â€” which is usually irrelevant. Alice impatiently retorts: "No, what did you say before that?" Bob repeats it, and it's exactly what Alice needed to hear.

Alternatively, Bob's monologue may be an attempt to hide the truth inside a long distraction (see also bread, eggs, milk, squick):

If he can remember so clearly what it isn't, he could probably save a lot of time by remembering what it is, but that wouldn't be as interesting.

Is very much a case of truth in television.
