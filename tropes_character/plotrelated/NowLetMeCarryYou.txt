Alice is always leaning on Bob for support. Whether it's because of poor physical health, mental instability or some other troubling factors, she's weak and dependent on bob's kindness and care to get her by in life.

Then something happens to upset this arrangement: Bob winds up wounded, incapacitated or possibly cornered by an army of bloodthirsty zombies. He can't get out of this mess by himself. He's clearly toast.

That is, unless Alice has anything to say about it. Which she does.

Whether it's because of character development or a hidden chekhov's skill that never proved to be much of an asset until now, Alice gets her chance to take the active role in the relationship and stand up for the one who has so long stood up for her, protect the person who protected her, take care of her caretaker. The helped becomes the helper.

The reversal in roles can be emphasized with dialogue (such as the trope namer stock phrase - "You carried me, now let me carry you") or by making the moment visually a clear parallel of earlier scenes, only with the parts switched around.

This trope very frequently results in a crowning moment of heartwarming. Sometimes it also serves as a crowning moment of awesome for alice.
