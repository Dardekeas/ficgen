The flip side to adaptational villainy. While some adaptations make a character take a level in jerkass, this is the opposite. A character is villainous or just not very nice in their original medium, but when the time comes for the adaptation, things change. Perhaps many scenes in which they kick the dog are cut. Perhaps they are a composite character with someone who was nice in the original. Perhaps the original suffers from values dissonance and is portrayed more sympathetically to match the values of a modern audience. Maybe a generic doomsday villain gains a motive and comes across as an anti-villain or a jerkass woobie. Another common route is to expand the character's backstory, giving them hidden depths and character development.

A subtrope of adaptation personality change. Contrast adaptational villainy. Doing this to a historical person in a work is historical hero upgrade. Fandom doing this to a canon villlain is draco in leather pants.

Note that despite the title, the character need not become an actual hero, just nicer than they were in the original.
