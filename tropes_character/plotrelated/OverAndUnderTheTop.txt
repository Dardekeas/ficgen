In a deliberate modification of having an economy cast, a series will sometimes have two characters who clearly share a given value X for a particular trait.

The 'Over' is the fanciful depiction who never has to worry about being over the top. The character can be a guilty pleasure, the comedic version, or to show the writers are self-aware about a topic without becoming a full parody. His proximity to others makes them immediately more subtle, and can make the reveal in other characters more credible when he acts as a red herring. He is allowed to be campy. Whenever the 'Over' does X thing, we know not to take it seriously.

'Under' is the semi-moderate to normal version of X, for a given value of normal. He is needed when the writers want to do a "serious" plot that requires X trait. Him being more moderate means he has more potential for the audience to identify with him and makes him easier to project whatever traits the audience wants. His possession of X trait is also useful as it usually prevents the audience from accusing writers of outright making fun of X trait. When the Under does X trait, we know it's a dramatic X.

If a show attempts both the comedic and dramatic, this sometimes occurs in a single character, leading to the sort of person who gleefully jumps on the object of their affection while needing an entire story arc to consider mundanely kissing them.

Naturally, this all depends on the audience being smart enough to spot it; if not, one can get misaimed fandoms, loud complaints, and worse.

If the "Over" charactor is introduced later, this is replacement flat character.
