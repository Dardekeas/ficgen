We here at the TV Tropes Wiki are fond of characterizing and analyzing our favorite fictional characters, finding out what makes them tick. We figured that it would be a good idea to organize some of the tropes for the trope overdosed series, because those can get kinda long. Within the following pages are trope lists of some of the main characters for popular series. Look, read, take notes... do as you like.

Just a few words of warning: If you can't find a character sheet, you can try looking here (and index it appropriately then), or create a page under "Characters" name space.
