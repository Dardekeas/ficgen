Bob finds himself among the candidates for his dream occupation. This is something he's wanted his entire life and dreams of rising to the top. Once he starts training at said job, it becomes quickly apparent that Bob... has zero talent for the job.

Still he keeps working at it (possibly undergoing training from hell)... and it doesn't help. (After all, hard work hardly works.) And what's more, there will be no applied phlebotinum or magic feather to smooth the way toward Bob's goals. He can't do it and that's that. Not to say that Bob is completely worthless. He may have plenty of viable talents. Just not in the field he desired.

Often, this character will find other ways to stay within his chosen field, and may even find happiness there (a bad pilot gets shunted to the flight crew or mission control), but he never really stops wishing for that which he can't gain.

Contrast with fake ultimate hero, where the image is there, but the skills are not. A heroic wannabe is likely to be this trope as well.

Compare sorry, billy, but you just don't have legs, i coulda been a contender, muggle born of mages, giftedly bad or minion with an f in evil (if said minion actually wants to be a bad guy).
