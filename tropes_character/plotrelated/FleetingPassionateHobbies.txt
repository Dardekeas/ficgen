A character trait mostly in sitcoms, but occasionally played straight. A character gets passionately involved in hobbies for short amounts of time, before putting them aside and starting something else. May set up a series that is essentially Hobby of the Week or something similar.

Compare compressed vice when this is done with character flaws, and why do you keep changing jobs? when it's done with careers.

If the character supposedly always was an enthusiast in today's hobby rather than picking up something new, see backstory of the day.
