katanas are just better. Slightly less well-known is that the quick draw is pretty damn awesome in its own way. If you find a person who is good at combining them, then you have an Iaijutsu Practitioner.

Iaijutsu is a catch-all name for several martial art schools which center on drawing and attacking in one move. The technique often includes multiple slashes, swiping the blade off, and the subsequent re-sheathing of the blade. The names Battoujutsu and Iaido are often used interchangeably, although the words have nuances in the Japanese language.

Although usually associated with Japanese swordsmanship, there are similar western versions for cavalry sabers. Another variant dates back to fiore, who taught swordsmen how to block weapons with a sheathed sword and dual wield the scabbard and blade for powerful combo attacks.

Users of this trope can often create sword beams, or just strike and re-sheathe so fast that it looks like a sword beam.
