The polar opposite of a screaming woman. While a screaming woman instinctively yells at the top of her lungs at the first sign of terrifying danger, hitches up her skirts, and runs away from it, screaming all the way, a Screaming Warrior yells at the top of their lungs at the first sign of terrifying danger, raise their weapon, and then proceeds to charge headfirst into it, screaming all the way. Occasionally, the Screaming Warrior is the terrifying danger, at least to his enemies. or friends.

Everyone likes a good battle cry right before a big fight, but this character just keeps on yelling even while the fight is well underway. Perhaps it's to intimidate their opponent, maybe it's just a habit, maybe it's to follow tradition, or maybe it's just cool to do. For bonus points, once the fight is over, don't be surprised if the character lets out one last cry of victory while standing over the pile of heap that was their opponent.

Not to be confused with make me wanna shout (where the screaming is an attack in its own right).

Make note that the trope is not limited to simply to screams. Loud, consecutive grunts and various roars very well qualify. A Screaming Warrior is most likely an angsty badass, action girl, proud warrior race guy, hot-blooded, a berserker or all of the above.

An onrushing army just wouldn't have the same impact without this trope, so expect it to go hand-in-hand with examples of the former - the likelihoods formerly mentioned can be disregarded in onrushing army cases.

Compare calling your attacks, kiai, leeroy jenkins, stab the sky, shouting shooter. Contrast tranquil fury.
