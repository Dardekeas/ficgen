When creating a distaff counterpart, captain ersatz, or similar character, some writers are smart enough to realize that fans are going to inevitably compare them to the original character, and will almost inevitably cry "rip-off", especially if they were created by editorial mandate. So one way to make them viable and differentiate them from the original character is to make him or her generally similar, but different in specific details, and deliberately develop them into another direction.

However, somewhere down the line, an unfortunate situation will often occur where a later writer just treats the new character as a rip-off of the older character, and intentionally retrofits them to be more similar, in powers or even personality. That is the Re-Ditto trope: when someone takes a divergent clone character and un-diverges them.

This is especially dangerous if the character could be considered a legacy character, since that route lets a writer kill off an older character without upsetting the general tone of a story.
