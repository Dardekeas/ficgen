Trying too hard to understand something prevents one from appreciating just how interesting and/or beautiful it really is. Appreciation is a feeling, not a number! Reducing the divinely incomprehensible to the mundanely complex isn't just tedious and hard Â— it's fundamentally wrong.

At its heart this trope is a reaction against hyper-intellectualism; a fear and frustration of someone assigning a number or a scientific name to everything from rainbows to emotions. It could be summed up as "put away your calculator and enjoy the beautiful sunrise". This trope is for those that respond "it's nothing special; just an optical illusion".

It can appear anti-intellectual because it has the unfortunate implications of implying that only people that don't know anything about a subject can appreciate it. Naturally, experts of the given subject are repulsed by this idea. Their understanding is never questioned, just their ability to appreciate it. Nobody has ever, for instance, advocated fielding generals who know absolutely nothing about planning, logistics, strategy, or tactics but feel like they have deep psycho-spiritual connections with warfare. It's only when the abstract scale comes into play that arguments start.

An expert that fully understands and appreciates their field is aversion of this trope. In fact, such an expert can be an inversion. In other words, their understanding increases their appreciation instead of decreasing it. For example, one can marvel at both the visual beauty of a rainbow in addition to being in awe of the complex and delicate interplay of factors that allows it to exist.

This is a major gripe that romanticism has against enlightenment. Related to straw vulcan, hollywood atheist, and mother nature, father science, since this kind of character is almost always male. One manifestation of this is don't explain the joke. Compare centipede's dilemma, and don't think. feel.

Contrast anti nihilist, awesomeness by analysis, enlightenment superpowers, emotion suppression, geeky turn-on, and especially the world is just awesome for all the beauty missed by those who cannot see the pretty numbers in the page image.

Has nothing to do with the otaku surrogate character from questionable content, or with the film The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-In-The-Moon Marigolds.
