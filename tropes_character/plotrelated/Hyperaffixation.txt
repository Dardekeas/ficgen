So a character wants to distinguish himself from the rest of the pack. catch phrases are always a good way, since you don't need to see them in order to know who they are. But a single catch phrase is so boring.

The answer: just add a specific prefix/suffix onto words.

In some cases, these characters will create new words with new meanings this way, but more often than not they're just the same word with that prefix/suffix tacked on, and no definition changes. Sometimes, also, other characters may start using these words as well, turning them into, in a manner, borrowed catchphrases or share phrases.

The ultimate of this trope is, unsurprisingly, mcdonald's, who use their 'Mc' prefix on almost everything they sell. In their case, not only have their words made the general vernacular, but also their naming habits, as the other wiki has proved.

A subtrope of catch phrase. If used often enough, Hyperaffixation may become involuntary, ultimately turning into a verbal tic.
