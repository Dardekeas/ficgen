Frequently, characters will claim that it is in the nature of the human race to destroy itself. When the character is an alien but not a proud warrior race guy, they'll look down on us as primitive, violent, and socially unacceptable.

According to the more pessimistic sociologists, this is truth in television. Even the non-heavy drinkers agree that we possess this tendency. The basic reason for this is that our technical ingenuity — that is, our ability to devise new ways of building and doing things — is advancing faster than our social ingenuity — that is, our ability to devise new ways to associate and relate with one another.

Part of this problem stems from our biology — at the core of every mammal brain is a snappish crocodile that is upset when others enter its territory or make sudden moves around them. Behavioral patterns that once ensured our survival now court destruction. Luckily, the desire for self-preservation keeps this in check — there's a reason the United States never had a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union: they didn't want to be destroyed themselves.The other part is cultural, stemming from the behaviors and values that we teach to successive generations. Because of this conditioned element, the exact degree to which we seek self-destruction waxes and wanes over long periods of time, but because our military prowess is now reaching earth-shattering levels, it may soon be the case that even a slight lapse in reasoning may render the entire matter academic.

But whether or not we're actually likely to drive ourselves to extinction is a matter of personal opinion.

A sub-trope of humans are the real monsters and humans are morons. Contrast ape shall never kill ape. See also pretext for war. May be used as a justification for a zeroth law rebellion.
