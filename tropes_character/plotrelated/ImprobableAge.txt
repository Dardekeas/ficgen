A character whose age seems inappropriate with their occupation or position given the amount of experience they would need, whether or not said age is actually important within the storyline. Tends to lean to the younger side, resulting in the teen genius, kid hero, and hollywood homely for female characters all inexplicably under thirty. In benign cases, it's because the writers assume the audience better identifies with characters their own age.

In some cases, an age that is improbable on first glance may actually be truth in television. In ages past, life expectancy was shorter and people needed to be capable at a younger age; in fact, studies seem to indicate that adolescence is a modern creation. This has produced a very curious effect where the longer humans live, the longer the age gap of competence tends to widen. It also must be noted that many of the examples below occur in violent settings; people growing up in a warlike environment have no choice but to adapt and learn to survive, and the faster the better. It's a common problem in societies with inherited positions of authority, although usually some adult regent would be appointed until the heir comes of age.

For characters whose age seems inappropriate given their maturity (rather than competence), see wise beyond their years. If the people running a society are improbably young, see teenage wasteland. If the character is of an appropriate age but the actor is too young, it's an inversion of dawson casting. Can be easily hand waved by making a character older than they look, or even really 700 years old. May lead to child soldiers. Contrast competence zone.
