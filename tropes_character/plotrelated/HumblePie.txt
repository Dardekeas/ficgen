This is a single, significant humiliating event that deeply affects a character. The subject is typically a particularly obnoxious and/or self-important character who makes a serious mistake or suffers a defeat that forces them to reflect on their failure and their ego. This happens most often to antagonist characters, and is usually portrayed as being well-deserved.

Sometimes, just to rub it in some more, it can be followed by a humiliation conga, and might result in breaking the haughty. In more obvious cases, the character will actually be called out for his arrogant attitude, but usually the situation is more subtle and the realization is more personal.

There are many ways for a character to respond. Oftentimes the character will simply accept their failure, realize the error of their ways, and change themselves to become a genuinely more tolerable person. Other characters simply cannot handle eating Humble Pie, and may react with anything from a villainous breakdown to something much more drastic.

The trope name comes from the phrase "to eat humble pie," meaning for someone to be humiliated. The phrase is derived from umble pie, which was a food made of offal (that is, the internal organs and other "throw-away" parts unwanted by the wealthy) during the Medieval Period that was often eaten by servants and lower-class people.

A similar phrase is "eating crow", a bird known for being particularly unpalatable.

Compare with humiliation conga, which is what happens when a character is forced to eat several Humble Pies all at once, and break the haughty, which may occur as a result of pie-eating.
