Characterization, narrative and sexuality tropes commonly applied to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual or queer characters.

While in the real world, GSRM persons are just as varied in personality and traits as straight/cisgender ones, it has suited television writers to use common stereotypes for their gay characters in lieu of actually making them "real people". To be fair, gay TV characters in general have become more realistic since the 1990s. But the stereotypes still remain the favorite tool of the hack writer - or the comedy auteur looking to parody or shock.

It's been noted, by the way, that in contrast to gay characters and their stereotypes, bisexual characters are virtually unknown on TV. Writers don't seem to know how to portray them, although when they do appear they tend to be the casanova or looking for love in all the wrong places, at best. It's also not uncommon for their same-sex attraction to only be mentioned, while their onscreen love interests are always the opposite sex.

Within media intended for gay audiences, gay writers have their own subculture of stereotypes that occasionally leak into the mainstream.
