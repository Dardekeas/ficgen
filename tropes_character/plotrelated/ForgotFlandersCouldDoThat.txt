A long-flanderized character displays a hint of their old self.

For example, Bob is a mediocre dart-player, but fans stereotype him as being "the guy who sucks at darts". Then an episode shows him winning a dart match.

Alice is a trained ninja, but later episodes flanderize her as the shy, soft-spoken love interest. Suddenly, an episode has her karate-chop a guy in the throat.

Huh. We forgot Flanders could do that.

An effect caused by never live it down / flanderization crashing head-first into canon and catching fire. In the case of flanderization, can sometimes stem from a character check. Compare chekhov's skill, when the forgotten trait or ability ends up being important to the story. See also minored in asskicking.
