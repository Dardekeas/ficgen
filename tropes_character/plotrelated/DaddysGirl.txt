The daughter adores the father-figure and at times the mother (if there is one) feels left out. The daughter, who is usually either a single child or the only girl in the family. Likewise she's often the father's favorite. In extreme instances, this can be wife husbandry or result in the daughter becoming obsessed with her father to the point of electra complex.

Due to their close contact to the male parent, Daddys' Girls can sometimes acquire boyish traits and interests at odds with expected female personality types like one of the boys. On the opposite end of the spectrum, she might be especially girly like his sweet little princess. The third possible character is the socially awkward one who gets understanding and encouragement from her father. Naturally, any girl who looks up to her father this much wants to follow in his footsteps, thus never a self-made woman. At times, the girl can also end up as a bratty teenage daughter (or spoiled brat if the father is rich).

In the likely chance that she has a younger brother, she is very protective of him. Daddy is typically very protective of his girl as well, ranging from twerp sweating potential suitors to going full papa wolf on men who wrong her.

If the family consists of a girl, a boy, a mother and a father, the girl will most likely be Daddy's Girl and the boy will be a momma's boy, causing conflict in the entire family. If the Daddy's Girl acquires a stepmother, there will most likely be tension between the two, as one (or each) will be jealous of the other and the woman will either become or be seen as a wicked stepmother.

It's the flip-side of even bad men love their mamas and momma's boy. Often associated with lineage comes from the father.
