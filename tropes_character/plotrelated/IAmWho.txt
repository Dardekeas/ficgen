The main character must be special somehow. The hero who would save the world cannot be just a farmer's son. In the rare case that the hero is not prophesied to do something or the current villain's relative, he or she is probably a powerful being, even a god, but does not know it.

The reason the character's true identity is hidden may range from simple lack of knowledge to a forced, magical-natured amnesia. In this kind of story, this revelation is often the plot's main twist.

Often, this is an awful truth that must be withheld at all costs, because the character is unlikely to be able to control their immense powers or use them responsibly at this point in time, or ever.

May lead to amnesiac dissonance; may overlap with luke, i am your father in case the character is a god's relative. A particularly nasty revelation  for example, a robotic reveal  may drive the poor protagonist utterly mad. If it's not the protagonist who's secretly special, then this is king incognito.

Subtropes include amnesiac god. Often the result of a changeling fantasy. Related to tomato in the mirror. If everyone else knows the truth, the hero's been locked out of the loop.
