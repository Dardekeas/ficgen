A character with a distinguishing characteristic of swearing noticeably more, or at least in harsher words, than the rest of the cast.

Keep in mind that this is relative; if everyone swears a lot, that's not this trope, unless of course this character swears more loudly, more vulgarly, and more often than the rest of the cast combined. Conversely, in works where swearing is otherwise nonexistent, a character can be this even if the worst that comes out of their mouths would look very tame in other contexts. Not all works have one of these: a lot of the time most or all of the major characters use about the same amount of profanity, or if some do swear more it is not by enough of a margin to make it a noticeable aspect of the character. What matters here is that a character is set apart by swearing more than everyone (or nearly everyone) else in the same work.

These characters are likely to drop cluster f bombs where they're allowed to. Otherwise they may be doomed to gosh dang it to heck! or angrish. symbol swearing, too, is an often effective option. May also be subjected to the swear jar.

Contrast the snark knight. The trope name is an example of sir verb-a-lot.
