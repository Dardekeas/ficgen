In many works of fiction, the female member(s) of a group, be it a married couple, siblings, or true companions, are often portrayed as inherently better grounded than the male members: more rational, more reasonable, more level-headed and sensible, and often morally superior.

Note that this trope is not about any specific instance of individual female characters being particularly sensible, but about depictions in which female characters are automatically placed in a more positive light than their male counterparts. This specific kind of positive discrimination is most common in comedy, but occasionally turns up in other genres, and like all forms of positive discrimination may also be applied to the token minority as well.

A form of double standard, in that it both holds women to an unrealistic ideal and holds men to a lower standard. like its counterpart, the trope is inherently sexist, or at the very least grounded in author appeal. Which reason is more disturbing is left to the reader.

Compare females are more innocent, mother nature, father science and mars and venus gender contrast. Often combined with ugly guy, hot wife and with henpecked husband where the husband is then portrayed as deserving the henpecking. More than often enacted through a right way/wrong way pair. my beloved smother is an inversion. opposite trope to men are better than women.
