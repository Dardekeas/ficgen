Where the most powerful member is the na√Øve newcomer. In some series, the protagonist starts his adventure by joining a group that's already been in business for a while before the events of the story. This is often to help the audience to relate to the hero more, as we're meeting the main ensemble with him. Because the ensemble are already close to each other, but not the protagonist, expect him or her to receive a chilly reception.

Compare ensign newbie.

Contrast team prima donna.
