Subverting the old joke, this character really was born yesterday, or this week at least, either artificially aged or just plain made the age they are now. They tend not to understand slang, or much of anything else, and will misunderstand social rules with usually comic results. May also be the result of a person being born normally but kept in some kind of stasis and never being conscious during their development since they still awake as a 'new' person.

Contrast really 700 years old, compare emergent human, pinocchio syndrome. They're often prone to blunt metaphors trauma as well. Can be coupled with artificial human if they were recently created. The extreme end of younger than they look. Pairs well with born as an adult.

Note: Please be careful when adding robot examples as, broadly, they almost all count. As a general rule examples should be kept to those that act in a way that is very strongly reminiscent of the Trope description. real life examples may be added but should be related to medical conditions.
