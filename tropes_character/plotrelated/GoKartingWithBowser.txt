 the hero and his arch rival are staring each other down! This is it! We're getting the final battle... wait, why are they sitting down and playing a game of checkers?

not all heroes and villains are actively out for each others' blood, some heroes are reasonable and tolerant, and a few baddies can be perfectly civil. On more extreme ends, enemies who are opposites (ideologically or otherwise) can engage in a peaceful activity to have a bout of diplomacy. But just like a sympathetic p.o.v. can show even the antagonists have a good side, likewise friendly enemies can sit down and have a nice chat every so often. In the end, they're not there to engage in fisticuffs, though they may engage in a bout or two of social combat. Rather, they're there just to meet as friendly rivals and maybe, just maybe, win the other person over to their point of view.Essentially, the heroes join the villains out shopping. Occasionally, it will be a dinner date, and it can happen frequently when the hero is living with the villain, especially if they are punch clock hero and villain. If the bout is meant to emphasize their mutual intelligence, they'll probably play chess.

Now, this all sounds very nice and cheerful, right? Maybe people don't have to hate each other, even if they're opposed? However, this can take an entirely different feel if the villain is a karma houdini who has committed horrible crimes and is getting special consideration because he and the Hero share history.

This trope commonly comes up when the cast involves itself as a universal-adaptor cast, where they might be bitter enemies in one canon but are neutral or even friendly in another. Such is the case with mario kart and super mario games.

Compare dating catwoman. Contrast villain over for dinner. If the enemies happen to be deities as well, it's god karting with beelzebub. If, rather than Go Karting With Bowser, you're instead playing energy ball tennis with ganondorf, that's tennis boss.
