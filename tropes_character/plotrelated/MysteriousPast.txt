A character has a mysterious past which is hinted at but never fully revealed.

This trope provides the writers with enormous freedom to have previously unknown (to the viewer and possibly also the character) relationships to other characters, special skills, prior histories with the big bad, knowledge of prophecies or the future itself, a macguffin, or other examples of ass pull as needed. In effect, since nothing is known, anything can be true. This is limited to such elements as can reasonably be fit into the time period. A thirty-five-year-old can't have sixty years' past (unless they're really 700 years old but that is only an option in fantasy or science fiction). Failure to submit to this limit results in an expansion pack past.

A character can have a partially mysterious past as well; for instance, Character A was Character B's childhood friend, but when they meet up A has KGB agents on their tail and the ability to fire guitars from their eyes.

Often a former teen rebel's old rebellion will be part of their mysterious past. Any dark deeds done in this period are part of a dark and troubled past.

A noodle incident or ten might have happened in such a Past.
