A technological pacifist is a scientist, corporation, or organization that — no matter how smart they may be or how many other things they create — will never, ever design, produce, or sell weaponry or military products. Why they may do this may vary, but generally it's given that using their genius to make weapons would go against their core principles.

Of course, often whatever they create ends up getting used as a weapon anyway by someone who starts to just think of the potential; alternatively, they might make a weapon of peace that inevitably gets used for war.

Compare/contrast to prime directive for groups that have no problem making weapons for themselves, but simply refuse to share them with less advanced cultures.

The title comes as a pun on technical pacifist.
