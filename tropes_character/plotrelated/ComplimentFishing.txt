Let's say you've written something. You know it's good but you still want to attract more feedback and compliments than you'd normally get.

Of course, you can disparge the first ones as insincere to really get them rolling.This is a common tactic of the shrinking violet - or, at least, the writers who make her say these things. I suppose they think it's endearing. Subtle attention whores (wait, what?) also love this trope, as it lets them bask in pity-praise without having to directly toot their own horn.

A sub-trope of self-deprecation, and the dishonest, manipulative little sister of the heroic form.

This is a pretty common truth in television.
