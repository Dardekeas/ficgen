hometown isn't doomed? Doom it yourself! Whether it's an accident, revenge or just plain anger, heroes sometimes display disturbing tendencies toward destroying their own hometowns, countries, planets or even universes. Bonus point if they simultaneously kill their parents.

It doesn't count if only the house is destroyed, in attempts to kill the hero or just to spite him. It also doesn't count if a broader war is involved, unless the character's actions directly created that war.

This is more frequent with villains. Sometimes it's to demonstrate how disturbed he is, other times it's a start of darkness event for him. Or maybe he just really liked the sound of being the last of his kind.
