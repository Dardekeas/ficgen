Some people become famous. They're well known, even if not very much is known about them. The Living Legend is famed in story.

Some famous people are famous for specific things. Some are infamous. Regardless, they actually did, can do, or were present at specific events. The Living Legend is famous because of where he's been, who he's been, who he's been with, and/or what he can do.

The Living Legend is respected for these things. Wherever he goes, people recognize him and buy him drinks. They ask him if he really did all those things. They want to know what it was like being where he was. They ask him to demonstrate his prowess.

This is a person whose reputation makes him larger than life even in his own time. The Living Legend can run the gamut from hero to villain, truth to lie, professional to amateur. The point isn't whether his reputation is deserved, but that he has it.

If the Living Legend doesn't deserve his reputation, he's no hero to his valet. If he deliberately plays up his false reputation, he's miles gloriosus. If someone else is doing this for him, he's the fake ultimate hero.

If his reputation is based on having just been in the right place at the right time, he's the accidental hero. If he's a random guy thrown into it, he might be an action survivor.

Sometimes the Living Legend's reputation is non-specific and he's shrouded in myth. Sometimes it's very specific and everyone calls him "the butcher of x".

When a character's deeds are remembered in subsequent works, he's legendary in the sequel.

When he shows up to ruin a protagonist's day, the ace will often be hailed as a Living Legend by his legion of squeeing fans.
