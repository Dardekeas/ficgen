The easiest character to write is one who comes premade.

For various reasons, an author writes themselves or their friends into the story, as themselves. Maybe it's an in-joke. Maybe it's a message. Maybe they're just seizing the nearest source of inspiration.

Although this is more common in fiction than some authors would dare admit, it really broke out in webcomics due to their less formal standards. The ur example was probably Penny Arcade (although see below). A popular variation is to name the character after the person's online handle instead.

The furthest extent of this is an author writing a story or script about an author having writer's block. The longer a schedule slip, the closer the chance of this appearing gets to 1.

See life embellished for what occurs when this gets out of hand, (which can unfortunately degenerate into a mary sue if handled incorrectly), and journal comic for an entire comic that's taken straight from life. Also see self-insert fic. Compare her code name was mary sue, no celebrities were harmed, write what you know, tuckerization.
