A character is partly defined by a Trademark Favorite Food that he or she craves and eats, all the freakin' time. Usually in a way that makes you suspect that they're addicted to the substance. If they're a one-note cook, they'll typically be good at making it.

Sometimes justified if the item is a power-up food for the character.

When a character exhibits an obsession for food that corresponds with a stereotype for his race or culture, it is usually considered a discredited trope unless played to lampoon the stereotype.

See Also: stock animal diet, which applies this to an entire species of animal, and hollywood cuisine, which applies this to an entire culture. Also must have caffeine, the coffee-specific version; for Brits as often depicted, this is spot of tea. If the answer is "every food", you have a big eater. If it is "everything, no matter if food or not", you have an extreme omnivore. A specific, sometimes overlapping version of this trope is someone who has a sweet tooth. If they talk about that food all the time, they're obsessed with food. For a darker and more specific version look at i'm a humanitarian. See also impossibly delicious food. May overlap with comfort food in cases where the comfort food is the character's TFF.

Compare your favorite and drink order. Contrast with does not like spam. If a big eater character passes up on their trademark favorite food, expect things to get serious fast.
