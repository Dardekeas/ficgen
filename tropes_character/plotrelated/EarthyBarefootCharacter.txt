Characters who walk barefoot are often shown to be close to nature, animals and their surroundings. These characters are sometimes depicted as a wild child or nature hero living in jungles, forests or in the wild. They tend to be deeply connected to animals (and may even have the ability to talk to them) and plants in general. At the very least, they are the nature lover.

As for personality, they are usually carefree, down to earth, stubborn or energetic. If they have powers, they'll usually get dishing out dirt or green thumb. They may also posses some mystical abilities like controlling animals, changing the weather and such.

Bare feet are probably used for this as you can feel the ground beneath you (therefore you'll be "connected" to the earth) and you wouldn't really get that feeling from shoes or socks, so generally, a character exhibiting this trope does not like shoes.

if played realistically, such a character might have particularly calloused and dirty feet, but beauty is never tarnished often rules this out, especially when it's used for the sake of author appeal.

Related to fertile feet. Subtrope of does not like shoes. Compare and contrast with barefoot poverty.
