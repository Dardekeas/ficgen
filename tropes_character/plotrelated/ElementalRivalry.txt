One of the easiest ways to put emphasis on two rivals is (if the context's right) to give them contrasting elemental powers, usually matching their character.

The most common couples are fire for the hot-blooded one and ice for the calm one. light and darkness are also extremely common, especially between the big good and big bad. In anime and manga the pairing thunder and wind is frequent, referring to Buddhist Mythology. Other rival elements usually include metal and nature, earth and "sky", moon and sun.

Of course the "rivals" aren't always enemies. Usually they can be friendly rivals or even siblings but make sure the elements are ones that would be in natural opposition before you add an example. (Electricity-Fire, Rock-Dirt, etc. are too similar)

Subtrope of red oni, blue oni. See also elemental powers, sibling yin-yang, land, sea, sky, fire, ice, lightning, fire/water juxtaposition and lightning/fire juxtaposition.
