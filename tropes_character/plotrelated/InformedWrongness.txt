Showing when someone is wrong can be a powerful tool for an author. It can characterize the villainous or misguided, it can lead to an aesop, and it is vital for strawmen in author tracts. It's even easier for an author to just tell us that someone is wrong rather than go through all those boring complicated fact things. Unfortunately, this often means that when you think about it, they aren't wrong at all. The fact that we're supposed to be dismissing their opinions is because the writers are telling us to more than any actual logic.

Can be a center point in the war on straw. See strawman has a point for this trope when used with the strawman archetype. See the complainer is always wrong for one situation where this often comes up.

Compare and that's terrible in which characters are clearly shown to be villainous, but this detail is outright explained, anyway. Contrast the sometimes overlapping never my fault, when the character responsible completely deflects blame onto someone else.

If taken to the extreme, these characters can become the designated villain who will commit a designated evil.
