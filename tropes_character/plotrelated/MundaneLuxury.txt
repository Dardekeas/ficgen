To someone who has had a rough life, even the simple things are a big deal. The woobie, the butt monkey, the chew toy, and other downtrodden characters tend to know better than to take them for granted.

In fact, when presented with simple kindnesses and conveniences, these characters will be completely overjoyed. The things that are utterly mundane to most people will feel like the most extravagant of luxuries to them. Our potato chips are their caviar. They react to simple fare from the local burger fool as if it were a five-star restaurant. And a simple shower will feel like a day at a fancy spa to them.

This trope is different from a sense freak, but there is some overlap. A sense freak gets their appreciation for mundane sensations from bizarre alien biology, or the loss thereof upon assuming human form. Mundane Luxury comes not from a character experiencing such things differently than normal humans do, but from not having had a chance to experience them at all, and it's not just physical sensations either. But the most important distinction is what the character's love of the mundane says about them. sense freak is used to establish characters as otherworldly and supernatural, while Mundane Luxury portrays them as downtrodden, illustrating the poor living conditions a character has suffered under, serving as an object lesson in appreciating what you have.

The inverted trope occurs when someone loses a Mundane Luxury. This might happen when one enters poverty, gets stranded on a deserted island, or becomes trapped in the past. One might miss toilet paper, or chocolate. bamboo technology might avert this problem.

Compare with humble goal (where gaining a Mundane Luxury is a major motivation for a character), simple yet opulent.

Contrast with the spoiled brat, who is so used to luxury that normal living standards are like poverty to them.
