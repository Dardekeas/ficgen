In works of fiction, the one thing immortal beings fear above anything else, is death. The very thought of a mortal existence is terrifying, and they may not even be able to wrap their heads around it. And if an immortal is brought down to mortal or discovers their immortality is not absolute, they will refuse to accept this because the idea of their death is something they can not or will not tolerate.

This can also occur if the person in question is not actually immortal but is just very powerful, their ego will not allow them to accept that their power is not enough to ward off the reaper, and they will seek ways to avoid it. In this case, they fear death not because they are immortal, but they sought out immortality because they fear death.

This makes perfect sense, in a way â€” when you're immortal and cannot die, and depending on the type of mortality cannot be killed, you would of course want to watch out for the things that can kill you. And it's not like you have anything else to fear, you're immortal, the world holds no danger for you except for that one weapon or that one person who can end your life.
