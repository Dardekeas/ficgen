put your hand down. this is not a vote.The worst fate possible might well be immortality. Sure, you might like the idea that you get to live forever and see what the world's like hundreds of years from now, but what's eternal life compared to the pain of life in general? From eventual boredom to eternal entrapment and torture to the emotional anguish of seeing your loved ones die, one by one, as you stay fixed in time.

When done anviliciously, this can seem like sour grapes on the part of the very much mortal writers. May be used as a fantastic aesop.

This attitude toward immortality is older than feudalism, going back at least as far as the Greek myths about Tithonos's age without youth and Prometheus's punishment and of course the appeal behind he- why is your hand still up!?Compare blessed with suck for those that angst as well as and i must scream for the mindset this can create.

Contrast living forever is awesome for those who like it, and immortality seeker for those who seek it, and eternal love where immortals fall in love.
