When a character quests for eternal life. Sometimes it's given to them, sometimes it isn't, sometimes it's given to them and they regret the consequences, but their desire and actions towards immortality are what count towards this trope.

Originally, this trope could be used for heroes and villains alike, as evidenced by quests for the Holy Grail and the epic of gilgamesh. Later it became one of the typical goals of an evil plan and thus the methods of achieving it were nasty, vile, and despicable. When heroes seek it they usually ultimately learn an aesop and refocus their goals.

See immortality (and in particular immortality inducer) for ways to achieve it and living forever is awesome for why they want to achieve it. Contrast who wants to live forever? for people that have immortality and hate it. Also death seeker for those seeking death instead. Not to be confused with glory seeker, someone who might want to go down in history, but doesn't seek literal immortality.

Courtesy of The Epic of Gilgamesh, this trope is older than dirt.
