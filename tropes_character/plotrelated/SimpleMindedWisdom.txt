A "simple" character (particularly a servant or rural character) displays uncommon wisdom â€” usually much to the surprise of an arrogant main character. Creates an aesop moment.

This would seem to derive from Cervantes' Don Quixote, where the archetypically "simple" Sancho Panza occasionally produces statements of great wisdom (although in that case the main character, Don Quixote, often fails to notice or credit that wisdom).

Compare dumbass has a point, which is what said insufferable genius may say after hearing the simple character's idea.

See also: achievements in ignorance, too dumb to fool, whoopi epiphany speech, infallible babble, hanlon's razor. Contrast ditzy genius, which is in many ways the diametric opposite of this trope, and seemingly profound fool, in which other characters detect this falsely.
