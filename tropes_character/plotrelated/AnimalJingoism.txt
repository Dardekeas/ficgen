Sometimes, different species, such as cats and dogs, are written so that they have a built-in and unquestioned animosity for no other reason than that they are stereotypically considered to be adversaries. A dog that doesn't chase cats will be considered 'weird', even if they were raised together from birth. On the other hand, those same dogs will almost never chase after mice unless provoked.

real life is more diverse: there are dogs who bully cats, and there are cats who bully dogs. There are also plenty of cats and dogs who get along very easily and even like each other. Both will usually eat mice.
