Two people are circling each other romantically, or perhaps are already together. Other characters in the story smile fondly at the couple and ship them. And then there's this guy. He does not like the two people together, makes his opinion known, and clearly hopes that the ship will sink. This may be for a variety of reasons:

 He's secretly (or not-so-secretly) in love with one of them.

 There's a  He thinks one or both of them simply aren't good for each other.

 He just doesn't like one or both of them.

And there may be other reasons too. If it progresses far enough, may result in attempted relationship sabotage. Related tropes may include overprotective dad and my sister is off-limits!.

Contrast shipper on deck.

Compare moment killer, when the interfering party only ruins a certain moment and/or may not be intentional; and ship sinking, when a ship is sunk by the writers, not characters.

Considering that this trope shows up at least as far back as shakespeare, it is older than steam, if not even older.
