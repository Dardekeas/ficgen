This is a character who has to do everything according to precise schedule, every day of their lives. You could set your watch by them. This is often portrayed as being unhealthy and/or tied in with some kind of mental condition. Obviously, watching someone go about things the same way for the entire story would get very dull, so the plot generally forces them to break this schedule at some point.

See also clock king, someone who knows not only their own schedule but also everyone else's, and super ocd, which this can be a part of.
