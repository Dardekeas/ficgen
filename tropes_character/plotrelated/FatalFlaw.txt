heroes have a Fatal Flaw which they wrestle with on a consistent basis. This may open them up for specific conflicts later â€” when a protagonist's fatal flaw is encountered through the course of a plot, the audience's reaction is very tense.

This is not to be confused with what aristotle calls hamartia, also a key part of tragedy. A hamartia is a mistake or error a hero makes which leads to his undoing. It is NOT the same as a fatal flaw. This confusion arose from the misunderstanding of Aristotle' Poetics in the 19th Century.

In classic literature, a Fatal Flaw is often what prevents a tragic hero from succeeding, or serves as the cause of their tragic mistake. It is usually some sort of character deficiency listed below or, in conventional television, an addiction of some sort. In modern television, the Fatal Flaw is more likely to lead to a very special episode.

Some specific Fatal Flaws:

                Note the resemblance to the seven deadly sins . Also see virtue/vice codification for a more comprehensive list of vices identified by various authors throughout history.

If the fatal flaw doesn't play any role in the story, it's an informed flaw. If the flaw isn't quite so fatal, you're likely dealing with mr. vice guy.

A literal fatal flaw, as often seen in science fiction and fantasy, would be phlebotinum breakdown and/or achilles' heel.
