An Introverted character is one who, while not necessarily being shy, is still far from the most social person you will ever meet. They prefer working alone, or, if they have to work with others, prefer small groups, and probably will not be the leader. They're often portrayed as more intellectual than their more extroverted counterparts, though this isn't always the case. Also, while they're less likely to actually show their emotions, they probably feel just as much as said extroverted counterparts (which can result in some very withering rants if they're pushed too far).

The short version: An introvert gains energy by being alone, and expends it by being in large groups of people. They tend to be either melancholic or phlegmatic.
