Even in a series where the characters aren't traditionally good or evil, there will be one who is an idealist. Perhaps they seem to have a strange compulsion to help others even when it isn't convenient, or perhaps they live by a set of principles. From the point of view of the others, that character will be completely untrustworthy; everyone else can be depended upon to act in their own self interest, but nobody can predict the idealist, especially when they decide to uphold their ideals over their own apparent self-preservation.

This trope is a hallmark of lawful neutral characters of Type 2 and 3, and is a major contributor to their frequent flanderization into lawful stupid.

Compare knight templar and good is dumb. Contrast reliable traitor.
