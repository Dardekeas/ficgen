Few things say badass the way a well groomed moustache does. Well, unless you're a woman, although that's not out of the question. There's just something about a man who carries almost half of his body weight on his upper lip that screams "I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all outta gum". Growing a 'stache (or turning up with one after an absence) also works as an easy and quick way for an established character to take a level in badass. It may also turn them into a chick magnet.

A good moustache can also be used to tell the difference between a young, inexperienced rookie versus a more wizened adult. The mere presence of this facial hair can be a signifier that the person sporting it is not the type to appear delicate, young, and boyish. Rather, this guy is matured, rugged, and prone to awesomeness.

Not to be confused with the beard of evil, although a badass beard may also be present. The Badass Moustache is smaller and more defined and does not inherently bring with it villainous intent. However, it is an essential style accessory for dastardly whiplash, who twirls it while cackling an evil laugh.

Not all moustaches are badass; there is a fine line between this and the porn stache. Growing a 'Stache is not related to growing the beard, except perhaps metaphorically.
