Misery Builds Character is a stock aesop and stock phrase that unpleasant, distasteful activities and events are good, because the suffering that the subject goes through will help his personal and spiritual development in some vague, unspecified manner. Sometimes quoted as "A little suffering is good for the soul," or as friedrich nietzsche puts it, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger". When done right, the trope can show that someone can grow and mature once they had their share of humble pie or have suffered enough to build themselves up and get past their suffering. If done wrong, the trope can imply that you can only become a better person by suffering rather than building character on good deeds.

This message is often delivered by a parent (or parental substitute) to a bratty half-pint as part of a set of instructions or admonitions. If the addressee is a mouthy kid or little miss snarker, a sarcastic rejoiner is all but inevitable.

Of course, this trope is not limited to children, and the phrase can be used between adults as well.
