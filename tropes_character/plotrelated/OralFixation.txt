Sometimes a character will suck or chew on something as a form of characterization. These range from toothpicks and blades of straw or grass to lollipops and cigarettes. smoking is cool is an example, and it's possible that some of these are a way to capture the look while the no smoking rule is in force. An Oral Fixation might also be a sign they are an ex-smoker, having substituted one habit for another. When food is used, this can overlap with erotic eating.

In anime, having a piece of straw in one's mouth is a common depiction of a banchou, or juvenile delinquent gang-leader character. In the West, the closest equivalent is the dead horse trope of the toothpick-chewing thug â€” a character chewing a piece of straw merely signifies he's a country mouse.
