A common trait among characters who have no social skills due to an offbeat background, also the spock, and those who are just that comically serious. These characters do not understand sarcasm. A lot of times, that can be annoying to the sarcastic ones in question. Although characters like this are also often literal-minded, some aren't. Sarcasm is tricky for someone to understand, because while "That's great," sometimes does mean that something is great, other times it doesn't. Everything depends on tone and gestures.

A Washington Post contest once dubbed this 'gap' between a sarcastic speaker and the person who misses it the "sarchasm."

For the intermittent effect, see sarcasm failure.
