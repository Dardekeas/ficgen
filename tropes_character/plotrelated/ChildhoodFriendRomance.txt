Childhood Friend Romance is a part of romantic plots, when characters develop romantic feelings for someone who they spent their childhood years with.

In the cases when this love turns out to be one-sided, it is sometimes explained with "Westermarck effect", a theory that claims that people who grow up together are psychologically hardwired to think about each other like brother and sister. This theory was later questioned when it was realized that though few of the people studied had major romantic relationships with childhood friends, many had crushes and romantic feelings that just didn't make it.

When it is mutual, and none of the characters are bound by the "Westermarck effect" (maybe because they only met when they were older than 6, when it's supposed to apply, or only for a shorter time), it is usually played as a special bond between the two characters. childhood marriage promises may be involved.

When it is one-sided, the friend might grow to care for the other's child or sibling.

The victorious form can be a second love, after one or both have married, and then lost their spouses.

Subtrope of childhood friends. See also patient childhood love interest, for a variant common in harem series.

See also just friends, which these sort of romances generally go through, because as the name says, they start off as childhood friends before all the confusing effects of puberty happen. (stupid sexy friend may apply when the Westermarck effect doesn't.) See also i don't want to ruin our friendship, in which these kind of romances may be postponed or avoided because of a strong childhood friendship. Or even see also puppy love, where 2 children below the age of puberty already form (or try to form) an officially romantic relationship.
