So there's this one girl. You know the one. The one who really gets around. She'll jump into bed with just about anyone who asks. She...well, she just really likes having the sex. You get the point.

But this girl, who will schtup men, women and most species of plants, is utterly unobtainable for this one character. That character doesn't have to be the protagonist, and, in fact, rarely is. Most of the time this is used to demonstrate that the character's sad and pathetic; after all, if Betty Bangs-A-Lot won't kiss him, he must be pretty crummy at this life thing. This is almost always used as a comedy gag, largely because it's too depressing to contemplate under any other circumstances. Think of it as even sluttiness has standards.

More rarely, on the other hand, it can be used to demonstrate quite the opposite. Sometimes the reason the promiscuous character refuses to have their usual mindless, consequence-free sexytimes with one target is that just this once, they're holding out for something more meaningful.

Can cross over with entitled to have you when the person feels that because she sleeps with "everyone" she has an obligation to sleep with him.

Note that pronoun-laced description aside, this trope works perfectly well with Manwhores.
