Why they're in front of bars and not behind them, no one knows. The dirty cop often appears as a villain in both cop shows and criminal procedurals. brutal, fascist, and often on the take from the local mob or worse, this cop makes most criminals and prisoners look like...well, saints.

All too often an example of truth in television. May escalate to bad cop/incompetent cop for entire precincts.

See blackmail is such an ugly word, cut himself shaving, rabid cop, noble bigot with a badge, prison rape, corrupt hick, lawman gone bad, etc. If a cop's framed as one of these it's police brutality gambit. If a cop outright murders people, you've got a killer cop.

If it is just a facade and the cop secretly has a heart of gold, it's noble bigot with a badge.

For real life examples, please limit them to instances where there was an actual conviction.
