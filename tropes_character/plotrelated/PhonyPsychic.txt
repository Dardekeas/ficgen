The grift-speak name for a person that runs a psychic game is 'Reader'. And it ain't about tarot cards.

They are the profilers of the grift world. A reader learns more about where a mark's buttons are with a single side-long glance than most people will ever figure out about him. Certainly more than the mark does, anyway.

Phony psychics have a specialized set of tools available for exploring those buttons; Tarot cards, Ouija boards, convincing trance-states, cold-reads, and so forth. These are used to refine the reader's understanding of how best to operate the buttons. Once they are clearly understood, the mark is moved into one of a number of specialized tales.

Some of those tales:

   See fortune teller for more "legitimate" psychics, and not-so-phony psychic for legitimate psychics who think they're phony.

No Real Life Examples, Please!.
