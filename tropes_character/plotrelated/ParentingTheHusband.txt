A modern, less "offensive" variation of the henpecked husband, where in a married couple, the husband is quite a child-like, slobbish jerk, and the wife is like a parent to him except that she can quite easily provide him sex. Sometimes, the wife may talk about feeling like she really does have one more child than the number of children they have, and guess who the extra is? Ironically, her job of child care may be made easier by the husband being able to connect to their children more effectively.

Sometimes, though, the husband is perfectly angelic or a hard worker, or a mixture of the two, and the wife is simply motherly with no shallow motives, with him being most of all a bumbling dad with a penchant for causing wacky hijinks that she must resolve, this being part of a closer to earth setup.

A rather awful double standard; the notion of a girlish wife in need of control and protection by a fatherly husband rarely appears today and is largely perceived as overtly sexist, (similarly, the henpecked husband scenario is considered nowadays to be a big take that against the sole idea of a woman pulling the weight on the family— see the description above) but this one persists. There are unfortunate implications on both sides— men are told that they're useless and incompetent, at least in the realm of family life, and should really just let their wives take charge; women are told that they can't expect their husbands to act like grownups and should just resign themselves to having to carry their husband's weight responsibility-wise and being regarded as the boring killjoy of the family for it.
