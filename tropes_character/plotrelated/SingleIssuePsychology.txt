In real life psychological issues stem from many sources — some biological, some cognitive, and some related to experiences and memories — and overcoming them often takes lots of time, effort, and sometimes medication. While finding the source of the problem is important to helping a mentally ill patient, it is only part of the process, seeing as it simply allows the psychiatrist to get an understanding of just what is wrong. Once the source of the problem is found and they understand how the mind has been affected by whatever causes, it makes it easier to work out the proper methods and/or medication necessary to help the patient overcome it.

However, this is a little too complicated for fiction. It's much easier when all a person's problems stem from a single traumatic incident, and working through that single incident will instantly cure them, so fiction tends to represent psychology this way. Remember, tropes are not bad. If psychological healing were played with 100% complexity, certain mediums couldn't manage to deliver it in time. Movies, for example, have time limits of about 2-3 hours maximum, and it would be impossible to cram that much detail into the story without risking the eight deadly words.

Compare with cynicism catalyst or freudian excuse, when a dark and troubled past is used to explain why a villain is/became evil, and idiosyncrazy, where a villain is obsessed with a single issue around which all their crimes are themed. See also bored with insanity.
