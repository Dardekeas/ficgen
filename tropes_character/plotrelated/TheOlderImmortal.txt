In a group of immortals, (or very long lived people) there will be at least one who is considerably older than any of the others. If most of them are 200 years old, one will be 600, or 1000. If most are 600 or 1000 years old, one will be 2000 or 3000 years old. And so on, possibly to time abyss status. These are the older immortal.

Not to be confused with elderly immortal, an immortal who appears physically old, who may or may not fit this trope.
