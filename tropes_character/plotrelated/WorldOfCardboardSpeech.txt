A fundamental part of telling a story is conflict: you want the hero to have their problems and, hopefully, overcome them in a satisfactory manner. In many cases that conflict is entirely external; the big bad is plotting to take over the world or otherwise spill the blood of the innocent and the hero is out to stop them. But there is also that conflict which is emotional; it exists in their mind and usually forms a mental block that they cannot break through.

A "World of Cardboard" speech is where the hero acknowledges that this mental block has been limiting them. And because of a recent personal revelation about themselves and/or their situation, they have found a way to excel past their previous limits. This trope is heavily dependent on the context of the story and the life of the character. Despite the room for variation, each speech has to follow the same pattern to be a world of cardboard speech: the hero is having trouble from an emotional/psychological viewpoint, the hero has a powerful revelation, and then they give the speech.

In effect, this is a eureka moment that leads to a heroic resolve. The speech itself can vary depending on the revelation, but the crux of this trope revolves around the epiphany that the speech giver still has the power to effectively oppose their foe. Universal to all of these speeches is that realization and being subsequently empowered because of it.

Because of how dependent it is on the individual character and story, the speech can overlap with any number of tropes, due to the context, and can come in many different variations:

Because this is an epiphany the character had, it allows them to express themselves and draw the audience into their struggles.

break them by talking is essentially the opposite of this, with a villain outlining the hero's flaws and effectively using it against them.

You can expect a moment of awesome if the villain attempts breaking them by talking and the hero responds with a "World of Cardboard" Speech. The villain may respond with "this is gonna suck."

not to be confused with a literal world of cardboard (and other materials). Unless the person giving the speech is a struggling jail warden or something like that, chances are this will have nothing to do with a cardboard prison. This is also not the same as the Cardboard World experienced by some LSD users according to Stanislav Grof; that would be more like a feeling that life itself is a crappy carnival.
