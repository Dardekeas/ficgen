immortality is no picnic: living to see all your childhood friends and great grandchildren die, having to drift from place to place or be chased out of town as a witch, and have to crawl across the Sahara for three weeks without food or water with a broken leg because you can't die.

Literally, your pain and threat reflexes will be burned out by the second century. Speaking of: all that stuff about eternity being boring?  (and the future sure ain't slowing down either) Money can come and go, but will mostly come since you have an infinite time horizon over which to accumulate wealth and make investments, and you'll always be around to enjoy it! As for the ones you'll love and lose â€” well, "kiss today goodbye, and point me towards tomorrow." Try not to forget your old friends, but don't let that shut you out from the amazing people you can and will meet! Besides, in some universes, death is more boring than life could ever be, or is too terrifying to consider. Basically, rather than sour grapes griping, the immortal character decides to see the upside of immortality and enjoys it. It may not be a bed of roses, but life can be good.

See also eternal love, which may be a contributing factor to enjoying immortality. Contrast who wants to live forever?. Rarely overlaps with immortality immorality, even though the "immoral" character usually expects that living forever will be awesome.
