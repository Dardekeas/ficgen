A newly introduced character who has had little backstory or character development undergoes a sudden shift in characterization that becomes their "established" self for the rest of the series. Common with the ensemble dark horse and ascended extra.

What separates belated backstory from normal character development is that this change in characterization happens without warning and little justification from what had already been shown of that character. However, since it usually occurs early on in a series, it's often accepted by fans as a needed re tool to change the character along with the not yet solidified flow of a new series. Really, just mix and match from the backstory index.

This phenomenon is not really character derailment, as producers often state that they just didn't know the character back then, and a more complex and interesting character usually arises from retooling of the initially more flat portrayal, instead of the other way around (though not always).

This happens a lot in webcomics when attempting cerebus syndrome, to overcome a previously flat cast. See also divergent character evolution.
