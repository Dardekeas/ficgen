A stiff character learns and grows from unwanted interaction with annoying and eccentric people.

The focus character is a fairly stiff guy (rarely a gal), may be the only sane man, the comically serious or a jerkass of the "stick up his rear" type, and often comes across as an ineffectual loner. He may not be content with his life, but it's stable, and he probably has a long-term plan for fixing what he thinks is wrong, if he can just get the right breaks. Instead, he is dragged into wacky hijinks by the other characters against his will, making a mess of his life. But implicitly or explicitly, the goal in the story is to make him a better person by putting him through "horrible" experiences - or at least ones he considers horrible, in order to show him the brighter side of things.

May involve a manic pixie dream girl, but in most examples, it's an entire cast imposing on the stiff guy's time, money and patience. the power of friendship is usually evoked by the end of the story. There may be a montage as the character remembers how things used to be, and how despite how much the other characters irritate them, they have made stiff guy a better person by getting him to take off his jade-colored glasses.

Contrast defrosting ice queen, an always female version, and unsympathetic comedy protagonist, who may have a similar personality and equally annoying cohorts, but does not have the character development.
