The characters of a TV show encounter a celebrity...who is offscreen at all times. They're pointed out at the other side of the room, referenced as having just left, something like that; or we see an insert of a hand or an elbow or the edge of a back of a head, which could essentially belong to anyone. Basically, they couldn't get the star to appear, or the bit was too minor to bother, or they're doing a subversion of the typical celebrity star episode.

Less common in animation, where you can pretty much draw whoever you want and impersonate the voice.
