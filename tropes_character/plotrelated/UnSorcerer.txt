A muggle born of mages is someone privy to the masquerade, born to parents with magic and powers, but entirely mundane himself. He ought to be just as powerful, but he isn't. No fear, though: the world is full of muggles and no one comments. He can simply become one of them.

In other words, he's way better off than the Un-Sorcerer.

In the Un-Sorcerer's world, there is no Masquerade, because everyone is a super...except him. Magic healing doesn't help, and neither does therapy. the kids at school tease him. He can't operate magitek. He can't even claim to be a badass normal, because normal people have the Power!As bad as this sounds, though, there's a silver lining: someday, it will turn out that his unique status is an asset to him. he may be immune to magical attacks, or to the corruption. Maybe he really has a game-breakingly awesome power that takes a long time to manifest. Maybe there's an ancient artifact that only activates for someone with no magic. Or perhaps, lacking a crutch, the Un-Sorcerer develops a charles atlas superpower in a world of squishy wizards. What's certain is that the Un-Sorcerer will go far, and may even be the chosen one.

An Un-Sorcerer can only survive by averting hard work hardly works. Contrast super hero. See also muggles do it better. Usually played as an aesop.
