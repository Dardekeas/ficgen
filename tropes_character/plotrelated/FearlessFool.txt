Sometimes, the hero is described as "fearless".

This, however, is invoked far more often than it is presented straight. More often, fear is presented as the wise and prudent reaction to danger (courage being the ability to act despite your fear), making the fearless person — if he exists — a fool. Sometimes, fear is the appropriate response. It is the mark of a naïve newcomer to think that his fear means he's a dirty coward; a character who cannot seem to learn it, no matter how bravely he acts or the greatness of the dangers he has faced, is the cowardly lion. In these situations, the fearless fool is either protected by dumb luck or too dumb to live.

Assuming, of course, situations of real danger (or needles -- you can always be afraid of needles). Only a dirty coward would gibber in terror at some trifling or distant danger. On the other hand, a miles gloriosus often claims to be fearless as a way to boast about his imaginary feats in battle.

Frequently the aesop of youth is wasted on the dumb. Often a case of attack! attack! attack!.. Compare nobody calls me chicken.

It can also be used by the character treating the injuries in the after-action patchup — to berate the hero for his stupidity in getting into trouble in the first place.
