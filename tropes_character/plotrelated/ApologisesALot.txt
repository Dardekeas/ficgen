sorry! This article has two quotes on the main page instead of just one.

Wait, are we describing apologizes a lot here already? Ahh, oh no!! I'm so sorry, I'll get started!

Alright, this trope is about a character who apologizes a lot. When called on it, may actually apologize for being so apologetic. Often a trait of a dojikko or cute clumsy girl and not out of place on a shrinking violet. Often comes with self-deprecation. Some apologetic attackers do this, some only apologize once or twice. sorry i fell on your fist is an extreme example. Sometimes associated with canada, eh? types.

Can also be a trait of real people.  In some cases, can be a warning sign that someone is a victim of abuse. In some cases, the  variation. For the trope's opposite, see the unapologetic.

Sorry, was that okay??



"Um, we don't have any more examples. Sorry!"
