Backstory is what happens to a character before they arrive on the present scene. All characters have one, but it may only be present for just one character, the entire cast, or the entire setting in which everything is taking place.

A good actor or writer has a strong sense of each character's Backstory, as it gives the character texture and shadings and keeps them from being two-dimensional. It makes an excellent source for the reveal, i.e., why the rival resents the hero so much, how the fake ultimate hero got his reputation, why the captain suffers from bad dreams. Hopefully, these things are revealed when the information is both plot relevant and likely to come up naturally.

In fact, a character's Backstory can be so interesting and important that it's a wonder it's just a Backstory instead of a part of a prologue or separate story; indeed, a particularly good Backstory can form the backbone of a prequel.

A good retcon may go back and explore a character's Backstory. A belated backstory occurs when the retcon radically and permanently changes a new character's personality. Some characters are given a mysterious or dark and troubled past as a backstory; these tend to be whatever the author wants, often retroactively growing, or changing.

Many fanfics exist to explore backstory (e.g. how spock's parents got together).

Specific Backstories include prequel, start of darkness, happy flashback, troubled backstory flashback, backstory of the day, when it all began, backstory horror, and standard cop backstory.
