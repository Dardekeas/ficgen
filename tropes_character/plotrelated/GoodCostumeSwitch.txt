Bob has decided to give up his evil ways. Perhaps he met a special person, found a few true companions (after all, loners are freaks), or became a pacifist. In order to show that his old self is gone for good, he decides to change his outward appearance. Bob gives himself an important haircut, puts on a new suit, gets rid of his evil tattoos, and so forth.

Popular changes include going from generic evil colors like red and black to generic good ones like white and gold, shaving the beard of evil, growing your hair out from the bald of evil, and covering up evil scars.Contrast evil costume switch. Sometimes caused by defeat means friendship.
