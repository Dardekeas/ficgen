The tendency of female characters displaying skills in something that is traditionally viewed as being more of a male thing to explain it as being the result of having a number of (usually older) brothers. Can have a certain degree of unfortunate implications since it can be viewed as the writers saying that the only explanation for female competence (in traditionally 'manly' areas at least) is that she grew up imitating males.

Occasionally there is gender reversal (that could be viewed as being equally sexist) with a male character explaining his ability in stereotypically feminine areas such as cooking as being the result of having sisters.
