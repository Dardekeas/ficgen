When a character needs to be shown as a genius without devoting an entire scene to backstory or problem-solving to demonstrate this, the creator will have them solve or play around with a Rubik's cube. This is done to quickly establish the character's intelligence in as little time as possible so that the plot can start as quickly as possible. The quicker and more casually the character manages to solve the puzzle, the more intelligent they are meant to be. This trope can be employed in any genre and has been around for nearly as long as Rubik's cubes.

This trope was named by matt sloan and Craig Johnson, of Chad Vader fame, in their online movie review show, Welcome To The Basement.
