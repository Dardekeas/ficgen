Cross distant finale with improbable age, sprinkle a little future badass and leave to simmer.

When a series involving young characters skips ahead to the future it will rarely be more than a few years into the future (unless time travel is involved of course), which keeps the characters fairly close to the people we know, and saves on the age makeup. Such is the temptation to show where the character ends up however, that many writers show the character already well established and very successful in their chosen career, even if only a few short years have passed and logic would suggest they should still be somewhere at the bottom, working their way up.

In extreme cases the character, who has barely started out a particular path before the time skip is at the very pinnacle of their profession when we rejoin him four years later. Compare alternate universe reed richards is awesome. It can be justified if the future self was using time travel for fun and profit.

Contrast future me scares me and future loser.
