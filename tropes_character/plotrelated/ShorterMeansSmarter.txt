Being the smallest in a group will always make you smarter (and usually more agile) than the rest. This, of course, is supposed to make up for being physically weak.

Reflectively, in a big guy, little guy odd couple the short one is always the planner, the schemer, the wise one. The taller may be the hero, the dumb muscle or the loon, the lazy one, or just the wild one, but the short guy is always somehow smarter.

Naturally, seen often with the smart guy and the big guy of the five-man band. Interestingly enough the ''first'' five-man band had a small guy who was only 'smart' in the trickster sense rather than the technical sense. The two roles would become conflated later. The small one as a child wise beyond their years, paired with a gentle giant. And, of course, everpresent in the short guy with glasses.

Contrast genius bruiser and badass bookworm.
