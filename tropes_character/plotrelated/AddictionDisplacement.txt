This character used to be an alcoholic or other addict, but now he's on the wagon. So he takes up some other habit to distract him from his cravings. Standard replacement habits include coffee or cigarettes (to replace alcohol) and gum or binge-eating (to replace tobacco).

This is truth in television; a habit becomes routine, and kicking the habit becomes much easier when you form a new routine (instead of rolling a cigarette you open a pack of chewing gum). For more serious addictions this may be even more true: according to some neurological schools of thought, when the brain becomes truly hooked on pleasure-causing chemicals released either due to a physical (e.g., drugs) or emotional (e.g., gambling) stimulus, it becomes virtually impossible to abandon that stimulus without consciously or subconsciously replacing it with another that produces a similar or better result.

Conveniently, such alternative addictions are also often narratively useful, as they allow portraying a character with an addiction that is neither completely crippling nor entirely an informed flaw, and can also provide a justification for treating a g-rated drug like a real one.
