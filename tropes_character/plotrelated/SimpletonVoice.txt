A character will open his mouth to speak, and the minute he does you immediately know that this character is stupid. Whether he's an over-muscled mook or the plucky comic relief, the one thing you can tell just by his voice is the fact that his elevator just doesn't go all the way to the top floor.

Very common in animated works, because allegedly such an obvious characterization tool appeals to children. In the golden age of animation, this sort of voice was used a lot by characters who were a parody of Lenny from the film adaptation of Of Mice and Men.

When the character is male, generally expect a halting voice in the low registers, or else a high-pitched quavering, with most sentences beginning with the word 'duh'. When the character is female, expect a high-pitched nasally whine or an even higher-pitched squeak-fest. Often, characters with this voice will use poor grammar. Male characters often substitute the t or d sounds for the th sound, like saying "dat" for "that." A valley girl accent helps for female ditzes.

A very common characteristic of mooks and the ditz.
