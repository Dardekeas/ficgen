A black person who loves classical music and hates R&B? An Italian person who likes Mexican food just a little more than Italian food, even though he has not a drop of Mexican blood in him? A lifelong resident of Nashville who hates country music, preferring heavy metal — or, alternatively, blues and soul? A middle-aged adult who likes modern rock as well as classic rock? An American with a penchant for Canadian rock music? A blond teen girl who gets down with death metal and gangsta rap?

Basically, as much as many of us may argue that we are all individuals and have a right to our own preferences, there are still preferences that are stereotypically expected of us. As such, people who deviate from those expectations may face opposition (or, at least, odd looks) from other people  be it from people of their own cultural group or from outsiders. They may even be accused of cultural self-hatred, even if they have nothing against their cultural heritage, but see no reason why they should be limited to preferences within their own culture.

This prejudice probably reaches its nadir where race and ethnicity are involved, as if people who look different are not only from different cultures but are of different species, and trying to pass from one group to another is seen as ridiculous. It gets even worse once you factor in religion. Since the stereotypical Christian is white or black, the stereotypical Moslem is Middle Eastern, and the stereotypical Buddhist is East Asian, a black person who wants to become a Buddhist or an East Asian who wants to be a Moslem will frequently be regarded as a freak - even though Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism are all supposed to be universal religions, and seek converts from all the countries of the world.

Perhaps, this character may not even start out as a rebel — but becomes rebellious only after repeated snide remarks about his preferences.

 Sepultura are a metal band from Brazil. Before them, the only music Brazil was known for on a widespread level was bossa nova. Thanks to Sepultura's influence, magazines started covering about metal from around the world rather than just the US, UK and Germany. Now we have the likes of death metal bands from India and Iran and power metal from Russia and Italy.

 Many German metal bands formed out of a desire to make their country known for something apart from Schlager and Europop. They wanted to make it distinctive, and as a result German metal is heavier and scarier than anything else until Black Metal from Norway became famous a few years later. Now, of course, German metal has itself become a cliché.
