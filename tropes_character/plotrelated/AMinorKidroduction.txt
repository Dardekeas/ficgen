Sometimes a work begins by showing us the main character as a child. It can also show us an important supporting character, but it's usually the main character. These kinds of introductions are barely longer than a few minutes at most, and they seldom affect the plot in any way other than being a way to highlight some basic character motivation, or perhaps provide the origin of some catch phrase. After the introduction is done, we are transferred to the present day (often via age cut) where the main character is grown up (and played by the featured actor or actress).

May show them playing with a weapon jr.. See also kid hero all grown up.
