This trope defines a character who is interested in fantasy, sci-fi, computer stuff, or other manner of geeky pastimes. The difference between this character and a proud geek is their total lack of embracing their geeky nature. To a vast majority of the population, they appear normal, but a certain group of friends is privy to their true nature.

Reasons for covering up their geekiness may stem from a perceived image of themselves they desire to maintain or running with a group of friends who aren't normally interested in that kind of stuff. Expect freudian slips when their topics of interest are discussed, and cries of or so i heard in a vain attempt to cover it up.
