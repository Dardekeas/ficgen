The phony veteran is a character who either lies outright about having any military service or greatly exaggerates their rank or achievements. Often, they will at best act as a hero of another story, but are liable to being more of the neidermeyer or a drill sergeant nasty, ordering others around based upon their (fake) expertise and credentials. Others try to excuse their vicious or self-centered behavior with the claim that they are the shell-shocked veteran. In military circles, Phony Veterans are known in the British Army as "walts" or "Walter Mittys", after the title character of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, a dreaming fantasist. Serially impersonating veterans is known as "walting" and grounds for a royal humiliation conga.

It's worth noting, that in the United States at least, laws have started to be passed making this behavior illegal, though at least one has been struck down by the Supreme Court as infringing on free speech (just falsely claiming to be a veteran is allowed, but falsely attempting to claim veterans' benefits is not). In Europe, it is flat out illegal in many circumstances. It is surprisingly easy to acquire the uniforms and even the medals for the blufff, given the ready availability of replica and genuine medals and decorations via eBay. However, given this modern age of the twitpic, youtube, Facebook, the internet footprint, and the message board, those attempting to walt often find themselves internationally infamous for their stupidity, as there are plenty of genuine soldiers, not to mention medal experts, who will notice their bullshit, call them on it, and very often post their antics all over the web. Various veterans organizations do not take kindly to walts, and go to great lengths to combat and expose them (or, in the case of the British ARmy Rumour SErvice - arrse - publicly humiliate them).

In other words, truth in television. See also miles gloriosus and fake ultimate hero.
