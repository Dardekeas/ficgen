This is where a character has eyes that are a color representative of that character, such as if a character who is heavily associated with water has deep blue eyes, or someone associated with fire has red or gold eyes, etc. Sometimes, a character's eye color is practically their one defining trait, such as if they are a spy or mercenary and wear a mask or something similar to conceal their faces, only able to be identified by another character by their eyes.

Compare and contrast windows of the soul, where eyes reveal a character's thoughts and feelings rather than their personality or power.
