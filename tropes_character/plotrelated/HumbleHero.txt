This is a special kind of hero who just doesn't care about their great power, or the fact that they're a world famous adventurer, or the idol of millions, and so on. Despite the great power they possess, they always defer to their friends or allies, and rarely want to take the spotlight, even when their friends encourage them to do so. This isn't caused by low self-esteem nor by guilt. The character honestly and truly doesn't think of himself as any better than anyone else, despite the great deeds they've done, or the inspiration they've become. In fact, such praise usually just embarrasses them. Tends to overlap with the all-loving hero as humility is usually one of their defining character traits and the magnetic hero as it's their humility to endears them into the hearts of everyone around them. Also usually a charcter trait of the paragon as this type of hero wishes to set the example that power rest in the hands of everyone.

The traditional line for this sort of hero is "i was just doing my job" or "it was what anybody would have done" or "i'm not a hero, i'm...".

This is often a main characteristic of the cape. See also heroic self-deprecation, where the hero acts humble because he thinks he's a loser. Can turn into martyr without a cause when taken to ridiculous extremes. Opposite of the glory seeker.
