A pacifist, by definition, is a person who is opposed to the use of violence to resolve disputes or gain advantages. It's really that simple.

Or is it?

No, it's not that simple. The opposition may be philosophical or pragmatic, it may be absolute or conditional. A philosophical pacifist holds the belief that violence is wrong, while a pragmatic pacifist objects to violence on the grounds that it's ineffective in the long run. An absolute pacifist believes that all violence is always to be avoided, a conditional pacifist believes that there are some situations in which it is acceptable (most often, in the protection of the life of another.) Some people consider the definition of pacifism to be "not killing" rather than "not using violence".

As a trope, though, pacifists basically fall into one of five categories, arranged here from most strict to most lenient.
