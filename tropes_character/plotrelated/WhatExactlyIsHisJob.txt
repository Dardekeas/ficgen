Often, especially in media with a large ensemble cast, there is one character whose function (in terms of his internal purpose within the cast) is a bit fuzzy. The details of this role are left purposefully ambiguous. Sometimes, the general nature of the character's role is quite evident; for example, the character might be big, intimidating, and good in a fight... but this naturally raises the question of just why the group needs someone who is big, intimidating, and good in a fight.

This is often lampshaded by someone unfamiliar with the group and their adventures pointedly asking "What exactly is his job, anyway?" When the question is played for laughs, the answer the newcomer gets is almost always something absurd. This can typically be paired with the main characters do everything since there are usually recurring characters whose purpose is ambiguous and the main characters can easily function without them. It's also common for an everyman, because the lack of specific role allows more of us to sympathize with the character.

Remember, this Trope is about a person's undefined or unsuitable role ; not about how a person earns his keep between episodes.

Compare the omnidisciplinary scientist, who has a PhD in Everythingology and awesomeology, rather than merely having to be everything and awesome, and the chick, who is very skilled in caring and diplomacy in a world where violence is the only option.

this is being confused for several other Tropes:
