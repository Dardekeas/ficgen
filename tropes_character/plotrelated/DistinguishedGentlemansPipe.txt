When a writer wants to show that a character is just a little bit "above" everyone else in the group, in one way or another, he'll give them a pipe. Almost always male. The man with the pipe is usually depicted as being a little bit older, a little bit (or a lot) smarter (often a professor), in control, composed, unruffled and dignified. Perhaps even pompous, snooty, aloof or a bit haughty. When being held, the stem points back at the smoker, drawing attention to them as being the most important; it can also be used by them to point with.

Generally does not apply to hillbilly/sailor corn cob pipe smokers, who usually defy the trope, though there are notable exceptions.

A key element in the attire of the quintessential british gentleman, often enjoyed in a smoky gentlemen's club. Also a key wardrobe accessory for the standard '50s father. The smoker is often, but not always, a good smoker. Compare cigar chomper, smoking is cool. Occasionally revealed as a bubble pipe for comedic relief.
