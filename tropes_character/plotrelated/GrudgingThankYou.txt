Though it sounds understated, it can mark the beginning of a change in a character or relationship.

Alice has always disliked Bob or people in general or is just very proud. But to Alice's dismay, she gets helped out by Bob in a moment when she really needs it. Glumly, Alice accepts and just when Bob is leaving Alice goes:

"Oh, and Bob..." Then a pause to indicate Alice biting the bullet. "Thank you."

This thanks, however grudging, is sincere; insincere ones fall under embarrassing rescue. It can often be a crowning moment of heartwarming.

Compare think nothing of it and does not know how to say thanks. If Bob has the same attitude as Alice, he is prone to express it, either because he dislikes the connection it formed, or because he did not act for Alice personally. Sometimes another character may apply a prompting nudge to get Alice to express her gratitude.

Contrast ungrateful bastard.
