Character Rerailment is what happens when a derailed character returns to their previous characterization. Generally this signals the end of a dork age. This may also follow a changing of the guard at the asylum. May also happen repeatedly if a character bounces between writers. Sometimes the time spent derailed turns out to be all just a dream.
