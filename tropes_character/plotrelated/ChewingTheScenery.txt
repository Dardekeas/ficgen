ACTING with EMPHASIS. Nearly any emotion will do here, so long as it's EXTREME!A common term for a scene where an actor's acting so damn hard that they're picking bits of scenery out of their teeth for days. Actors who really go "all out" are said to chew the scenery. Sometimes scenes can actually require this, but more often the actor and/or director just has the character go over the top.

This can include berserk button, freak out, and other exaggerated emotions.

It's well worth noting that this trope is one of the biggest causes of memes.

While this can often be a bad thing and ruin a scene, just as often it can add to the fun, whether a work is so bad, it's good or genuinely good. In a police procedural, this will often be due to a perp sweating or an exasperated perp.

Compare narm, narm charm.

Contrast dull surprise (emotionless moments when emotion is called for), dramatic deadpan (when the dramatic punch is from how low key it's presented).
