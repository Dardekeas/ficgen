Sometimes, characters develop over the course of a show.

And sometimes, shows will present new scenes from earlier time periods.

And sometimes, characters in a flashback will exhibit character unlike the way they acted before the time the flashback is occuring.

For example, when bob started on the show in 1991 he was characterized as a jerk ass, but became a jerk with a heart of gold in 1993, and then just became a nice guy by 1995, but is shown in a recent flashback to 1990 to have been a nice guy in 1990, with no explanation/extenuating circumstances.

Usually, this happens unintentionally due to flanderization and characterization marches on, often due to the too many flashbacks to track characterization in an expansion pack past. This might be used to retcon an existing flashback, maybe because it also had to be reshot since it was a flashback with the other darrin. If you not only pick up your old characterization but also your old visual style, it's a retraux flashback.

Trope name comes from "backporting", a concept in software development where features from a new codebase are imported to an older branch of development.
