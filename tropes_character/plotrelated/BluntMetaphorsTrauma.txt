Mastering a foreign language is hard. It's difficult enough learning the surface syntax, the grammatical forms, and the vocabulary. A foreign visitor must not only master the language, but learn the local customs and color. Having accomplished all this, the final barrier remains: figurative language. Idioms, metaphors and similes are wildly different from culture to culture, and cannot be reasoned out.

An easy way to show that a character is an outsider or foreigner, then, is to have them mutilate figurative language. This language is taken as literal and/or distorted into near unrecognizability. Of course, this is almost always hilarious.

In reality, it is not unusual for Blunt Metaphors Trauma to be caused by literal translation from a known language, such as "having one's ass circled in noodles" (though, simple misunderstandings are also a frequent cause of this trope). But in TV Land, it's more often done by taking an existing expression from a language/culture different from the character's and replacing its words with synonyms from the same language, something highly improbable in real life. The misspeaker isn't always the sole butt of the joke, though; often, such gags highlight how ridiculous and/or arbitrary the idioms are in the first place. Why can something be "a piece of cake" or "as easy as pie", but vice versa sounds utterly ridiculous?

This trope is perhaps the most common way to show a character is from a different (literal or metaphorical) place. Usually, they are foreign nationals, but they may have grown up in cloudcuckooland, or just have no social skills.

Compare mixed metaphor, malaproper, expospeak gag, sidetracked by the analogy, and either world domination or something about bananas. literal-minded characters are pretty much the embodiment of this. threat backfire is a possible result of this. Sometimes combined with literal metaphor, where an unlikely event sounds like a mangled metaphor.
