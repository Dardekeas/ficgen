A common characteristic of blade-wielding evildoers is their tendency to lick their weapons, whether clean or bloodied, as if their weapon was a cherry-flavored popsicle of non-diabetic death. Often the sharp edge, no less.

Generally considered a giveaway that this character is a psycho for hire, a combat sadomasochist, or otherwise sufficiently off his rocker to do anything. Especially creepy when paired with evil tastes good flavored hemo eroticism. Conversely, can be major fetish fuel.

Some characters feel a deep attachment to their weapon, almost as if it's a person. There's nothing wrong with that.

The one doing the licking isn't necessarily evil or rather, more accurately, isn't always a story's antagonist. An anti-hero or villain protagonist can be seen doing this, especially if they're engaging their super-powered evil side. Usually to showcase the fact they've either gone off the deep end or are very close to it, and that it is scary. Often major fetish fuel, especially if the licker is attractive.
