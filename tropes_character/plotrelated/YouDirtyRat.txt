In fiction, mice are often portrayed as sympathetic characters. They are always cute, nice, and sometimes even sweet, but often they are also portrayed as honest, brave, and forthright. Rats on the other hand - possibly because of certain historical events - are always chaotic evil in the West. Also, a mouse is apparently helpless while a rat can bite back hard (and sometimes does discourage a cat who is too pampered and not a real hunter). Consequently, if a cat is chasing a mouse, the cat is almost always the villain; if the cat is chasing a rat, he's almost always the hero.

Could be seen as a type of fantastic racism. See also nice mice and swarm of rats. A rat men or rodents of unusual size can be even worse. A rat stomp is when rats become one of the first monsters to face a newbie adventurer in an RPG. Compare with cats are mean, reptiles are abhorrent. bat out of hell is probably related, as bats are seen as similar to rats. Subtrope of what measure is a non-cute?.

trope namer is a quote wrongly attributed to james cagney. The actual quote, for those who are wondering, is "That dirty double-crossing rat!"
