So you're a film or TV show producer or the author of a book series, or the team behind a comic book, and you have a problem. You want a character out of the story, but you don't want to kill them off, you're not going to just flat out ignore them, and you certainly wouldn't have them just disappear for no reason and with no mention of it. However, there is a situation in which a character can be written out of a series in such a way that they can easily be returned later, if the creators so choose. They are Put On A Bus.

A staple of the prime time soap and particularly soap opera where casts are large and actor turnover is frequent. Conveniently, when such a character is brought back and now played by a different actor, it can be a case of soap opera rapid aging syndrome or the other darrin.

If the character doesn't return from such a way that arranging a return would be simple, this becomes a long bus trip. If they return once, it's the bus came back. Should they start appearing infrequently, they're commuting on a bus. If there's obvious malice involved in the character's departure, then they've been put on a bus to hell. There's also the chance of a bus crash or dying on the bus.

The bus in question may be a convenient coma.

Opposite of dropped a bridge on him. Compare with chuck cunningham syndrome, where a character abruptly vanishes without mention. See also absentee actor and written-in absence, for when a character disappears for only an episode or two.
