As collateral angst states, "Some stories make things even worse by having the casualty apologize for being hurt. They will use phrases such as "being a burden" or "letting you down" to express their guilt.

They are the butt monkey, the woobie, and/or the chew toy, and they apologize for it. When dangerous weapons are involved, thus pushing this trope up to eleven, it can don the name "Sorry I Fell Into Your Fire" or "Sorry I Bumped Into Your Bullet".

Compare and contrast . Compare why did you make me hit you? and apologizes a lot. my fist forgives you is the inverse of this.

Note: This is not when a character merely comments that "i hit him in the tray with my face." This is when the person being attacked apologizes for being attacked.
