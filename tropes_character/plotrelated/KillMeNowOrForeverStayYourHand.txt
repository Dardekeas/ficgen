This trope describes the situation where 1) Alice has a reason to kill Bob, 2) Bob knows this, and 3) Bob decides that the best way to handle Alice is to get both of them alone together and give her exactly what she wants â€” a chance to take his life.

Why would Bob embark on such a suicidal course of action? Because he believes that Alice is not a murderer, and he wants to force her to realize that too. When Alice discovers that she can't actually take another person's life, not even in a situation where no one would know she did it, she will have to acknowledge that she is a better person than she thought she was. She will also have to acknowledge that Bob is a better person than she thought he was, since an evil man would never have risked so much on the power of trust.

When this trope is played straight, Bob's gambit works and both of them leave the room alive. Though the exact degree of loyalty this inspires in Alice can vary widely, the result is generally a moral improvement all the way up to a full heel-face turn. Other times, Bob is wrong, wrong, wrong, and the best we can hope for Alice is that she will eventually regret killing the man who believed in her. Still other times Bob's gambit works, but only because alice has a reason to keep him alive.

This could be considered a secret test of character, though what is being tested is more Bob's estimate of Alice's character.

Compare get it over with, sword over head, please kill me if it satisfies you.
