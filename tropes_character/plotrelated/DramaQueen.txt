Characters who act dramatically a lot of the time, or at least when they have little reason to.

Whether it's fainting, hysterics, acting like they are in a second rate drama, or hyperbole to the point of bursting from it, the characters just live to be over-dramatic, even to the point of chewing the scenery and being a large ham. They also love wangst and the tropes overlap.

Even if not everything is a crisis, when it is a crisis, it is more important than anything else could possibly be. They could be in the hospital, but who cares about the guy with the broken leg? They have a hangnail!Although this is usually played for laughs, the term actually started as a nickname for Histrionic personality disorder. Yet over time, people would use the term, even about themselves, to describe people who were just being dramatic all the time.

Teens, particularly teenage girls, are sometimes portrayed this way, often overlapping with bratty teenage daughter. But this trope isn't exclusive to women. Guys can do this a lot as well, but this term is still used to describe them.

A sub-trope of melodrama, chewing the scenery.

A sister trope to attention whore, large ham, the prima donna, comical overreacting.

Compare it's all about me, sickly neurotic geek (who over-dramatizes things in other ways), hair-trigger temper (who oozes anger instead of drama), jewish mother (who oozes guilt trips), wangst.

Contrast the stoic (who genuinely avoids drama), stepford smiler (who has plenty of reason to be dramatic but isn't).
