A character known for droning on and on about topics of interest to no one but himself. As soon as he launches into one of his anecdotes, those present start rolling their eyes, going to sleep or having surreptitious conversations of their own. To qualify for this trope, it's not enough for a character simply to be verbose; it must be a source of annoyance and/or derision for the other characters.

Compare blah blah blah, motor mouth, and rambling old man monologue. He doesn't necessarily have to be really old (as in retirement age), but if a child or childlike character under the age of forty exhibits such behavior, he will come across not as this trope but as the somewhat similar constantly curious. Subtrope of the bore.
