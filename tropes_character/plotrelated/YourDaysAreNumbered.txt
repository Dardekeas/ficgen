A very basic premise - Alice is doomed, and she knows it. Whether it's due to a prophecy, a curse, a disease or something time travel related, it doesn't matter. What matters is that in the near future, she will die, and there is nothing she can do about it. Alternatively, Bob knows that Alice is doomed, but he also knows he can do nothing to save her.

Either way, cue misery and angsting. The character may also go through the five stages of grief. Of course, this does not mean that Alice cannot be saved in the end - there just needs to be a period during which it seems like she is doomed. The seeming inevitability of a character's death can be heartbreaking, although if taken too far, it may come across as deus angst machina.

It may be physically represented in death's hourglass.

See also secretly dying, like you were dying, someone has to die, the last dance, last day to live, i will only slow you down, almost dead guy, and whodunnit to me.

Not to be confused with you have no chance to survive, which is when the antagonist simply says "Your days are numbered!" or something similar, as a threat. Unless Alice is actually doomed, the statement in itself is that, not this.

NOTE: This is possibly a death trope, and it may include spoilers. Especially if this isn't revealed until later in the media.
