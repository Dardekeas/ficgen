A villain who seems glad to see you, comments on your nice outfit, and how you're better at heroism lately than you used to be. They may even salute your proficiency in battle. The disturbing thing is they don't seem sarcastic about it at all.

Contrast to affably evil, while the villain is not necessarily trying to annoy or flatter the hero, but rather that's genuinely what they're like. See also your approval fills me with shame.
