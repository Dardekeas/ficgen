A Gasshole is a character in a series who is known for being, well, gassy. The humor may focus on the frequency with which this person farts/belches, or the magnitude of their emissions, or their shamelessness about it. If they use their, ahem, talent as a form of attack, the trope is fartillery, and if they meet their match it's farts on fire.

A blatant example of toilet humour.

Although female examples have become common enough that this is no longer an always male trope, most examples will be men (see beauty is never tarnished). Women who are depicted as Gassholes will usually be the lad-ette, or at least a tomboy. Another type of female Gasshole is the classy lady or girly-girl type who lets out a very unlady-like belch or fart as a comedic gag.
