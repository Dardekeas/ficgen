The Number One Dime is an item that is in and of itself of little to no interest or usefulness (i.e., it is not a usable weapon), but to the character, it is ridiculously overimportant in a strictly sentimental way. It might be the token sealing a childhood marriage promise, a memento macguffin (particularly an orphan's plot trinket or fatal family photo) or a companion cube, but the overlap with macguffins at large is fairly minimal. However, hats, nice or otherwise, are frequent Number One Dimes. Expect the chew toy or the butt monkey's precious and rare Gobi Desert Cricket to be frequently threatened. If the character in question is a child, the Number One Dime will probably be a toy.

In real life, this is extremely common, and is depicted by a business having the first dollar (or whatever the local currency they use) mounted in a frame on the wall in the office, or on the sales floor.

In any case, should the item be damaged or lost, it is likely to trigger a heroic bsod or a roaring rampage of revenge, which sometimes leads to a arson, murder, and jaywalking moment. If dropped, they will do an indy hat roll to retrieve it. Merely being separated from the item is also likely to make them utterly distraught.

Compare and contrast with iconic item, which has the same meaning but is unique rather than generic. If the item is food, that's either trademark favorite food or (less specifically) obsessed with food. If the character falsely believes the item to be the source of a skill or power, its a magic feather.
