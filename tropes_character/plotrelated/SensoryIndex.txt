An Index for tropes about the senses: what they are, how they work (or fail to work), and/or the act of detecting sensations with them. Tropes that involve any of the five well-known human senses (Vision, Hearing, Touch, Smell, Taste) belong here, as do other biological sensory mechanisms (kinesthesia, echolocation, etc) and supernatural "Sixth Sense"-style variants.
