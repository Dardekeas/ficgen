So it's time for that routine checkup. The doctor is in, but you have a major problem. You have iatrophobia, the fear of doctors. You kick, scream, and whine that you don't want to go and that everything is fine. Who knows why you fear the doctor or what type you fear? Maybe you had a failed procedure, maybe you only fear dentists, maybe major surgery just gives you shivers, maybe you think this particular doctor or nurse is rumored to be insane, or maybe this professional is unlicensed to what s/he is trying to do (even if he or she is the closest thing you have). Whatever the situation, you don't want to go and place your life in someone else's hands...

This was more justified in the past, before the introduction of anesthesia in surgery and the use of disinfectants to prevent infection and the spread of disease.

Can result in a case of the patient has left the building. This trope makes for a decent character development, and tear jerker occasionally. Compare and contrast depraved dentist, mad doctor, and morally ambiguous doctorate: those are the kind of doctors you should fear. Also compare afraid of blood and c.a.t. trap. This is the super trope of afraid of needles. This is also a sub-Trope of why did it have to be snakes?.

Such characters left to their own devices may resort to self-surgery.
