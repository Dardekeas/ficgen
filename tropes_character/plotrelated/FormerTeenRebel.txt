An older character, who is seen as stodgy, virtuous, or law-abiding. We eventually learn that, in their youth, they were rather less so.

When the older character is a mentor figure to the protagonist, the reveal that they fit this trope can sometimes be part of the process of turning them into a cool old guy. It's also related to mysterious past, though there doesn't have to be any mystery involved. rule-abiding rebel or bourgeois bohemian can be the result if the character tries to have it both ways. This can lead to a case of generation xerox if the former rebel now has rebel kids of their own.

People who were rebellious in their youth — especially if their actions included a strong sexual element — are said to have been "sowing their wild oats." (This is also said in the present tense of older philanderers.) The etymology of the phrase is explained here. "Sowing one's wild oats" is often a great understatement of reality.

On a few rare occasions, a former teen rebel was actually a closet rebel who was living a double life. An extreme example might be the fundamentalist kid you knew in high school and/or college, the one who always complained about all the other believers who didn't live exactly by their strict interpretation of as the good book says. Then — sometimes decades later — the truth comes out. That obnoxious bible-thumper had actually gone through high school and/or college regularly cheating, lying, stealing and/or screwing anything that moves. Of course, such people don't exist in a vacuum. Somebody — a cohort or an adversary — knew the truth all along, but their warnings usually went unheeded. the reveal allows this person to say "i knew it" or "i warned you" to all the doubters.

Definitely truth in television. Contrast with used to be a sweet kid where a villainous or otherwise unpleasant character is shown to be much nicer and polite as a child. Compare parental hypocrisy.
