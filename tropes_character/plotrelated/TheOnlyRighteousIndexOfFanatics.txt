This is the one true index! All other indexes are heretics!

We are not fanatics, oh no, we are simply righteous!

Sadly, this index also contain a lot of heresy, and heresy of the worst kind: The fanatics, those who believe their lies just as strongly as we believe in the truth. And since they are the majority here, we grudgingly accept the title "index of fanatics". Also, our hands are tied: We cannot say which one of the tropes listed below is the one and only true path that expose all the others as lies. Why? Because that's the only way we could all agree on this text, that's why!

                                                                                                                                                                                            Adding tropes to this index: Do not include any trait that a fanatic can have, only traits that are intrinsic to how he is fanatic or is the only thing the fanatic cares about. Examples of traits that are common among fanatics but shouldn't be included anyway is the fettered, for happiness and for great justice. Also please note that far from everyone who fit a "who" or "how" trope is a fanatic. Having those tropes listed here means that fanatics usually fit these tropes, but in the other direction it merely means that characters who fit these tropes at least somewhat often are fanatics. knight in sour armor and the fettered are both borderline cases. The former barely makes the list, the latter barely stays out.
