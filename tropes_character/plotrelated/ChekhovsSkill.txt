Training in any kind of skill, ability, or knowledge that will likely later come in handy. Much like chekhov's gun, chekhov's skill covers instances where a character takes time in-story to become proficient at something.

If the hero takes time to teach his sweetie a self-defense Judo throw during the beginning, expect this distressed damsel to throw the mook holding her into a shark pool during the climax.

This is a counterpoint to suddenly always knew that, as proficiencies are gained and learned rather than mentioned or pulled out of thin air. Taken to extremes, chekhov's skill can be used to justify implausible fencing powers or turn the farm boy into a gun toting bad ass. In frustrating cases, it might go the way of forgotten phlebotinum and never see use again. Used well, it can lead to some satisfying heroics from unexpected places.chekhov's skill can also be used as a catalyst for other plot elements by having one character teach another, and getting some good character development out of it as well. Or even drive a plot as the seeker looks for a mentor to teach them chekhov's skill. If the skill is too complicated to be perfected so quickly, see instant expert.

If it is not a skill taught or otherwise demonstrated to the individual in question, then it is a chekhov's hobby. In the hobby, the skill is mentioned through dialogue and never takes up more plot than that. In the skill, even if the character hasn't perfected the dangerous forbidden technique it still shows them training for it.

If the character is shown training for a skill but repeatedly fails at it until everything depends on them getting it right, that's crisis makes perfect.
