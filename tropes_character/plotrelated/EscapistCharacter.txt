So you just picked up this book about a character who's powerful, incredibly talented, irresistible to the opposite sex, long-lost royalty, and friend to all living things. Sounds like a horrible mary sue story, right?

Except that you don't mind at all. Instead, you're seeing yourself in their shoes and enjoying it. After all, everyone likes to fantasize about being awesome once in a while. You can argue over whether or not they're a mary sue, but they're definitely an Escapist Character.

While mary sue is generally defined as being a bad thing, some of the most widely loved characters in existence are Escapist Characters with any number of common mary sue traits. While a badly written Escapist Character can come off as a mary sue, the key difference between the two is that a mary sue is the author's wish fulfillment fantasy, while the Escapist Character also functions as the audience's wish fulfillment fantasy.

Some members of the audience may identify with a character and others may not identify with the same character. Whilst many audience member's wish fulfillment fantasies have common elements, they are not all identical. Thus, the distinction between this and mary sue is very much a subjective matter.

Please remember that conceptually, neither wish fulfillment nor escapism are bad. Compare the showy invincible hero. See also: i just want to be normal, i just want to have friends, i just want to be special, i just want to be badass; wishes that are fulfilled by escapist characters.

Compare-Contrast the expectation lowerer; a character that allows you to feel awesome by being much worse than you are, and this loser is you; a character who the creator feels is a representative of the audience. This trope has nothing to do with the Escapist film or website
