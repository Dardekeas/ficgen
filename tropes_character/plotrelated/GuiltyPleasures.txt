There are shows or products that many people are ashamed to watch/use. That doesn't mean a character won't enjoy it and continue to consume it anyway, regardless of what's going on. In real life a person with such a condition usually shares some elitist point of views, and acceptance of their guilty pleasures can help them change their point of view.

Guilty Pleasure may, but does not always, overlap with closet geek. "Guilty Pleasure" implies that a person feels guilty for enjoying a show or product that they believe is low-quality, but for some reason like it anyway. The closet geek hides their fanhood for fear of what other people will say, but they may believe that the things they like are legitimately good and worthy of appreciation.

(This is a trope; for the novel Guilty Pleasures, see the Anita Blake page.)
