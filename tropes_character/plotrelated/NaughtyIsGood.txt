While society tends to prefer children to be polite and well behaved, while still adventurous and cheerful, in fiction there seems to be an either/or set up. Children who are adventurous and who have interesting stories to tell, or to tell about, always seem to be mischievous at least and sometimes downright naughty and ill behaved.

Well-behaved children are often antagonists to the main character if he or she is a child, and these "good" kids can be portrayed as being anything from just absolute bores, to evil incarnate. The reason for this might be because the well behaved children in the stories are often viewed as being suck-ups to the evil adults, who only want to take away all the fun stuff for little kids. These kids also tend to be 'tattle tales' if they're real sticklers for the rules.

This trope has been around in some form for quite a while, at least since the early twentieth century. Before that, especially during the Victorian era, naughty children in fiction would usually endure very bad repercussions for their actions... sometimes they would far outweigh the actions they committed. After all, in Victorian times, most writers are adults was in force to an even greater degree than it is today.

This doesn't necessarily mean the kids will get away with being naughty in naughty is good stories. They're just as likely to find they can't get away with nuthin' , but the story will still be on their side, rather than just saying "and it served them right!"
