They are so burningly passionate about everything that they do that they seem larger than life. They give their all in absolutely everything they do, regardless of the task. They can say the cheesiest of lines with a straight face â€” the best of them can say things that are so cheesy they use the so bad, it's good principle to become awesome. These characters are Hot-Blooded.

Using the power of guts, determination and badassery, they throw themselves headfirst into the worst situations imaginable and come out on top through sheer force of will, and often have a strong tendency to do impressive things. Even non-hot blooded characters or the nicest ones can occasionally have their own hot blooded incidents; this is frequently their moment of awesome.

Beware if they go into tranquil fury; someone's really managed to piss them off. Especially common in the super robot genre. A common trait of the ace, and to a lesser degree the boisterous bruiser. Compare with the large ham, genki girl and keet. If it's not pulled off just right, it results in narm.
