Occurs in a reaction shot. The character reacting to the outrageous whatever says nothing, but their eyes widen in a "these people are crazy" kind of way.

Compare aside glance when directed at the fourth wall, fascinating eyebrow when directed at the characters in question and eye pop for surprised cartoon character's eyes. May make use of eyedscreen. Could be considered a subtrope of facial dialogue. Sometimes related to oh, crap. no relation to eye scream.
