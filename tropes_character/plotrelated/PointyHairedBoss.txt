Someone promoted by the peter principle has been promoted way beyond his level of competency. He or she may have had a clue at some point, but has since swum out of his/her depth. The Pointy-Haired Boss, however, is the result of the dilbert principle, through which only the most incompetent and irrational workers are kicked upstairs, where they can no longer disturb the productive flow (theoretically).

incompetence, inc. is a likely place to find PHBs. Occasionally is surrounded by very competent workers when conservation of competence is in effect.

Very often such a boss is portrayed as not only incompetent, but also a little evil: The kind of guy who would steal credit from his employees and pin failure on them. In these cases he can be more contemptible than the corrupt corporate executive whom he serves; while the corrupt corporate executive sold his soul for money, power and fame, an evil Pointy-Haired Boss sold his soul for nothing but a job little better than that of his employees, and doesn't seem bothered by it. On other occasions, they may have been competent and serious about their job at one point or another, but a combination of having to deal with a bunch of angry employees with (frequently unfounded) axes to grind and higher-ups who were around only to micromanage to hell and back and act as nuisances eventually drove them to stop giving a fuck altogether and be just barely competent enough to not attract the ire of the upper management.

Occasionally he'll also hold the title of benevolent boss as well if his incompetence is more towards the job than their people skills.

All too often this is truth in television. Compare with the military's general failure.

Though not unheard of, this trope has nothing to do with actual pointy-haired bosses.
