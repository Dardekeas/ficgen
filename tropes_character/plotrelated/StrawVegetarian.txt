More often than not, no-one likes folks like this, often saying under their breaths, "Can't I have just one meal in peace?"

The vast majority of vegetarians, however, are not like this. Most have eaten meat before and choose not to continue doing so for multiple reasons. The more well-rounded ones are also respectful of what others eat, though it helps if that respect is returned.
