This character hasn't just beaten the odds once. He's survived several suicide missions. The uriah gambit failed. He won the last stand. In short, the hero has repeatedly accomplished so-called impossible tasks. And his superiors or the world at large have taken notice... and unfortunately for the poor hero, he or she is now the go-to person for missions that are thought impossible for anyone else.Characters like this can get this reputation a number of ways.

  The character really is that   One possible deconstruction of this trope is that the big good, big bad, or some other powerful or manipulative figure has been arranging things such that the characters always succeed, or at least have even odds. Once this aid is exposed, they have to face real impossible missions.

Subtrope is surprisingly elite cannon fodder. One of the reasons it's up to the player character, one-man army, and one riot, one ranger. In video games, save scumming probably helps. Compare impossible thief, who does (usually even more blatantly) impossible things in a different context.
