When we are first introduced to our Hero he or she is an unknown, a new recruit, a rookie, or a peasant from a recently destroyed village, but destiny is calling and he or she has answered. After many adventures, our Hero has accomplished great things. So much so that in the sequel he or she has become a legend, famed in story throughout the land.

When a sequel is being made, writers, directors, or game-makers like to take the protagonist from the original work and turn them into a legendary figure. This can be a way to help complete denouement from the original work which often gets truncated, or as a way to appeal to fans of the series who like to see their favorite character be recognized.

This trope is when the protagonist from a prior series or movie has become a legend in the sequel. They can be the protagonist themselves, a side character, long dead, or trapped in a time warp; what matters is that in-universe they are now regarded as a legend.

May or may not be shrouded in myth. Compare and Contrast with: from nobody to nightmare, took a level in badass. The reverse is uniqueness decay, where once-legendary things have become commonplace in sequels.
