exactly what it says on the tin, this is when someone doesn't like to be looked at, with the title being the stock phrase you're most likely to hear them bellow to underline the point. Compared to hates being touched, this one tends to be a more temporary state of being, often triggered by a heroic bsod, transformation into a body horror, or revealing a red right hand - after all, it can be understandably difficult to write a character who actively seeks to go unnoticed. Such situations are often remedied with the hero giving the afflicted love interest a cooldown hug and telling her that he still loves her, or that her wings are beautiful.

In a more mundane setting, this can be merely indicative of body image issues, warranted or otherwise. This version is almost always female.

Another version is a character being caught doing something they're ashamed of, for example if they've been caught with their pants down.

Not to be confused with the remarkably similar, defensive stock phrase said when everyone in the room labels a character as the most likely culprit of some misdeed of which he's not (entirely) guilty by leveling him an accusing stare — "Don't look at me!" rather than "Don't look at me!" — which is... another trope entirely. Nor is it to be confused with the also similar stock phrase where the characters are trying to figure out an explanation for a confusing or mysterious situation, and one who is genre savvy, believed to have special insight, or simply intelligent enough to figure such things out is looked to, only to respond this way.

Something to keep in mind when adding examples: it only counts as an example of this trope if it is used to imply that a character is ashamed of their appearance. It's not a example if it's yelled at an accidental pervert stumbling upon someone taking a bath.

Compare hates being touched.
