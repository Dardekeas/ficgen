In contemporary North America, about 20% of the population smokes tobacco. The number is small enough and the practice has been stigmatized enough over the last 50 years (since the science about health effects of smoking became widely known) that younger generations are accustomed to designated smoking areas and smoke-free public buildings. Tobacco use rates continue to fall as older smokers die off without as many younger consumers lighting up for the first time to take their place.

HOWEVER. If you're in a period piece, or a retro-future, or a pulp cyberpunk future, a crime-noir piece, or even an outdated twenty minutes into the future from a past decade, you might have to put up with the fact that everybody smokesâ€”especially men (it was uncommon for women to smoke until the 1920s when "masculine" behavior became more acceptable). If the setting dates to before the 1970s, ashtrays are going to be everywhere and there will be no such thing as a "non-smoking section" of a restaurant. If it's before the 1960s, smoking might even be seen as healthy and virile. During the period of peak tobacco use in America (late 50s-early 60s), more than 40% of the population smoked with some regularity.

Note that the extent to which smoking has been stigmatized varies from country to country, so this trope may still apply in modern media depending on country of origin. Eastern Europe and East Asia in particular have high contemporary smoking rates.
