An established character reveals a major part of his life story that is contrived as a plot device to match the subject of today's episode. We've never seen this side of the character before (and may never see it again). It typically happens in sitcoms.

Bonus points for being really implausible.

Similar to fleeting passionate hobbies, except in this trope the character supposedly has always had a long history with the hobby or character trait, rather than picking up something new.

compressed vice is a sub-trope.
