The (partial) spear counterpart to does not like men, this is when one of a character's major defining traits is their hatred of women. Usually portrayed not just as mere sexism, but unreasoning hate of women.

This trope is played for laughs more often than not — often a part of the unsympathetic comedy protagonist or the butt monkey's personalities. In earlier works a character's outright fear of women was treated as a running gag. Dramatic protagonists who don't like women usually don't like other men that much more. Perpetrators in Crime Dramas will often have this as the root rationale for their crimes against women.

women who don't like men will often be portrayed sympathetically, but members of this trope are usually just written as being bad from the start. Consequently, He-Man Woman Haters are very often (but not always) straw misogynists while their distaff counterparts are much less likely to be straw feminists.

Interestingly, the actual Spear Counterpart to does not like men, sympathetic portrayal and all, does exist — a vast number of romance novel heroes are exactly that! However, most of the works that get represented on this wiki are designed for a different audience.

The trope namer in this case is The Little Rascals, who held meetings of the "He-Man Woman Haters Club" on more than one occasion.

If the male in question hasn't hit puberty yet, that's girls have cooties. Compare celibate hero (considers women a distraction), licensed sexist (good guy with bad views), effeminate misogynistic guy (usually where the gay examples of this trope fall) and straw misogynist (Hates women, and that's terrible). not to be confused with a (nonexistent) Masters of the Universe spinoff about the titular hero being an example of this trope.
