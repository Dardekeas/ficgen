It's said that eyes are the window to the soul, and in fiction, their color is often the first way to hint at a character's true nature. In particular, characters who have gold and yellow-colored eyes tend to have some form of supernatural origin or powers that place them above normal humans.

In the West, this tends to appear on supernatural characters who have feline or lupine traits, so, understandably, they're often accompanied by werewolf-like powers. In Japan, this probably traces back to legends of kitsune (foxes) and their naturally golden eyes. It was said that a human possessed by a fox would gain gold eyes, and that a child born to a fox and a human would possess them as well. Because kitsune were also shapeshifters, this often shows up when characters change their forms.

It is also found around the world in many other contexts: in tales of genies, witches, and other mythological beings, where they cannot hide their golden or two tone eye-colors in animal form.

In the sorting algorithm of "uh-oh eyes", gold eyes fall one step below red eyes, take warning, since it's entirely possible for the character to just be a trickster rather than evil. Gold eyes are also harder to distinguish from "normal"-colored eyes, and hence can add more of an element of surprise if the reveal shows a character to be something other than what they initially appear to be.

A subtrope of technicolor eyes and mark of the supernatural. Compare yellow eyes of sneakinessIt should be noted that this trope is NOT for characters who just have eyes of this color, but rather for when the color actually indicates the character is supernatural in nature. Please do not add characters who just happen to have eyes of this color without the proper reason behind it. If there are only mundane characters who have this eye color in the work (that aren't mistaken for supernatural because of it), the work does not use this trope.
