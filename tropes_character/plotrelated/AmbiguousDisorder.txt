This character's behaviour is so bizarrely outside the norm that real life psychologists would be scrambling for the diagnostic manual to try to figure out what to diagnose them with. It's way beyond mere ordinary quirkiness. No reasons are given for the strange behaviour. No specific diagnosis is ever mentioned in the story. In fact, any resemblance to any real disorder is likely accidental; the character's symptoms are exactly those symptoms the writer wants them to have. It is a case of Ambiguous Disorder.

The disordered behaviour will often be played for laughs. This technique is generally used to avoid writing yet another patient of the week story about some specific disorder and to focus on the laugh-producing elements without having to deal with the serious issues. Or, less generously, to mock the kooky outer aspects of mental illness without the risk of getting angry letters.

In the instances where this trope is played seriously, the character usually overlaps with the spock, pinocchio syndrome, or tin man and focus on this character's struggle to befriend people or otherwise fit into society.

A lot of mentally ill people in classical literature, especially from the 19th century and earlier, tend to be this; psychiatry was a very young field back then (and, until a certain point in history, didn't exist at all), and so there was no manual to turn to if you wanted to give your character odd quirks.

Compare the disease that shall not be named, soap opera disease, victorian novel disease, and g-rated mental illness.
