Hippos (or, by their full name, Hippopotamuses, which is Greek for horse of the river) are usually considered as heavy, lazy, dim-witted, yet charming creatures, while in real life, they are actually very dangerous. Many people think that when hippos open their mouths really wide, they're yawning, when they're actually showing off their fangs to warn off other animals. They kill more people in Africa than crocodiles or lions.

In fiction, however, they are hardly ever depicted as dangerous. They are usually ugly cute gentle giants, who may be big eaters and/or fat idiots. And since they are very graceful underwater, they are often portrayed as fat girl or big beautiful woman, making them almost always female.

Fictional hippos can also be big fun.
