A bullwhip's signature cracking noise is a miniature sonic boom. It's about as close to the stuff blowing up type of coolness as you can get without infringing upon fantasy gun control. A whip is also, basically, more or less a long piece of leather rope, and we all know how sexy leather is, right? In video games, action adventure and fantasy tales, some characters will show how extra badass they are by using a bullwhip or other flexible weapon as their primary armament, as well as employing it for a building swing.

If this person is a woman, and they often are, she is likely to also have a stripperiffic costume that brings to mind a dominatrix outfit, and will probably be the vamp or the baroness.

This, of course, ignores the fact that whips are generally impractical weapons in close combat, unless you like the idea of flicking your own ear every time you crack that whip. In light of this, most whips will be weaponized by adding blades or spikes, making them out of chain link, being electrified or just magic in order to be a more convincing weapon, while maintaining the cool sexiness. Also, they're often employed to instantly tie up an enemy, despite being designed to avoid tangling. Less enthusiastic authors settle upon emphasizing disarming, tripping and choking attacks.
