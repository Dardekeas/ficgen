To contrast madness mantra, this is a prayer, koan, or just plain reassuring phrase that gives the speaker peace or confidence, or at least forestalls a panic attack in a dangerous situation.

Be advised, reading these entries may or may not actually make you brave... but it is all pretty reassuring!

If it works at a crucial moment, it may be adopted as a badass creed; alternatively, characters may use an existing Badass Creed to galvanise themselves in a moment of panic.

See also madness mantra. Might be used in a meditation powerup. May or may not coincide with a crowning moment of awesome.
