evil is cool. So cool, in fact, it's too cool for good posture. A trend for newer villains is to forego the egg-chairs and thrones of their forefathers in favor of more comfortable and casual lounge chairs, draping themselves over them in a slouch of villainy. If it's the starscream doing it, expect them to slouch in their former boss's throne as a way of posthumously insulting them.

This is usually done to show how blas√© and badass a character is; they're so bored and nonchalant that they aren't even bothering with conventional posture and look insanely cool in the process. This has the down side of making them less able to react if someone attacks, but that's not a problem if they are badass enough. Moreso, if their levels of badass are good, they don't even have to get up during the final battle. Of course, this could very well be a calculated effort to look insanely cool in the first place, but are you going to say that to the magnificent bastard's face? Don't overdo it of course, there's a fine line between a slouching badass and a bored tyrant.

Villains are inordinately fond of doing this in chairs that aren't theirs as well. Villains will surprise you by draping themselves on the hero's chair, with an ambush, an enemy mine offer or an offer you can't refuse, or to prove how badass they are prior to joining up more permanently. If there's an armrest on the chair, especially if it's a royal throne, odds are good that the character will adopt the Sitting Lion Beast pose and rest one elbow on it, with the hand tucked neatly under his chin, while sporting either a self-satisfied smirk or a glance of disdain. Bonus points if they're drinking a glass of chianti.

Compare with leaning on the furniture. Related to rebel relaxation and is often a case of orcus on his throne. A neutral (non-villain) variant is reclining reigner. Contrast kingpin in his gym, when the villain prefers to do something a bit more active than lounge around on furniture.
