Good Is Not Dumb is the trope where a sincerely good, kind, and polite character is underestimated by others because of their kind nature.

Unlike obfuscating stupidity, good is not dumb does not involve any deception at all â€” the subject is genuinely nice and honest, but the cynicism of others lead them to misread the character as the ditz, a gentleman thief, or some other gullible or deceptive archetype. After all, no one really gets through life being kind and trusting to everyone, right? wrong.Almost inevitably, the genuine goodness of the character will triumph, often accompanied by the comeuppance of the disbeliever. The con man will be thwarted, the sceptical cynic will be surprised by the power of trust, and everyone will discover that "good" is not a synonym for "clueless victim".

A direct inversion of good is dumb and dumb is good. Someone who is good is not dumb may realize that being nice to villains simply isn't going to cut it, so they may incorporate good is not soft. The ultimate stage of this is the guile hero who can play the chessmaster's game without falling into the ambiguity or clear villainy of the magnificent bastard.

Compare and contrast with wide-eyed idealist, good is not nice, gentleman and a scholar, beware the nice ones, crouching moron, hidden badass, evil cannot comprehend good, and good is old-fashioned. Also see rousseau was right, good is not soft and incorruptible pure pureness.
