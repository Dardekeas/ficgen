Billiards. Doesn't seem like a particularly evil game, right? Despite accusations that the cueball is "possessed," "cursed," or "hates me personally," pool typically isn't what comes to mind when you say "things a bad guy would enjoy." In fact, its image has softened by now to be considered a respectable game of skill for any age, and even used in kid's edutainment shows like Beakman's World to illustrate rebound trajectories.

Unless, of course, you're in the movies, where if you see someone playing pool, there's a 90% chance they're planning some dastardly deed at the same time. Whether it's due to negative connotations regarding the term "pool shark", or possibly due to the fact that pool is associated with illegal betting rings (which also serves as a convenient motive for a cash-starved antagonist to do any feats of nastiness the story requires), the image of a group of big bads and thuggish mooks shooting eight-ball seems to be engraved in the minds of filmmakers. The anti-hero and others may also play pool, to emphasize how cool, dangerous, and outside the norm they are.

For the femme fatale and the vamp, it's also a free excuse to get them to bend and sway in a variety of manners, showing off their body and especially their legs, and it gives them three ways to end the scene: keep on flirting and end on sexy; humiliate the mooks by beating them at their own game; or just start a bar brawl.

Part of the origin of this trope is in pool halls having been the new rock & roll once upon a time, like bowling before them and video arcades afterwards. Its continuing popularity now is likely due to a pool table's ability to fit nicely inside a bad-guy bar or a family-friendly den of iniquity. If a fight scene ensues, as it inevitably will, expect the cues to be used as clubs, swords, or broken in half and used to stab people, not to mention the balls themselves are really effective to throw at people.
