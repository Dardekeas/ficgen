Before the hero can achieve his destiny, he has to face himself and defeat the darkness in his own heart. Because only the worthy may pass, someone has to put the hero to the test and make sure that he has the character necessary to see things through.

Enter satan. Sometimes this is the literal Guy With The Horns and Pitchfork (or local equivalent); sometimes it's just the character's shadow archetype, or the old master. Regardless, it's the character who knows the hero's dark side better than the hero himself â€” and is determined to make sure the hero sees it, as well.

If the hero fails this secret test of character, expect things to end badly for him.

Essentially, when a supporting character talks to the hero to reveal what you are in the dark. Differs from a deal with the devil in that the Satan-figure is primarily concerned with exposing the hero's true nature (and can sometimes be akin to a trickster mentor, actively trying to improve the hero by getting them to see and reject their darker side); if the hero does not succumb to temptation, it doesn't mean that the tempter has failed in his mission. A type of threshold guardian. If the character playing "Satan" really does want to corrupt the hero, then they're the corrupter.
