A character characterized by his or her loyalty. Can be a trait of both heroes and villains. Most of them are supporting characters, intended as sympathetic. Indeed, if used on a villain, it can sometimes be used to flesh him out and give him redeeming qualities. Alternatively, it can be negatively portrayed as a threat to conscience.

When given to a main character or one in an authority position, expect it to manifest itself in protective instinct: as a papa wolf or the caretaker or someone who is a father to his men. When given to a sidekick, expect it to be an unselfish willingness to support the main character.

Should the object of this loyalty die, expect generous helpings of due to the dead as the loyal one works to honor the fallen one's memory.
