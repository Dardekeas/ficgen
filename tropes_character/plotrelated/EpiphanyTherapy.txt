Writers sometimes try to add depth to their characters by giving them some sort of psychological problem â€” always exactly one, neatly-explainable problem. Maybe they hate men due to a previous abusive relationship. Maybe the memory of their dead little sister keeps getting them down. Or perhaps constantly having their girlfriend locked in a refrigerator causes them to drive potential lovers away due to fear for their safety.After a while, writers may feel that the character has to lose this flaw. In real life, deep-seated psychological traumas take years to deal with and cure even in the best case scenario, and most require a lifetime of treatment. In fictionland, however, there are no therapists; fortunately, freudian excuse, my greatest failure, the heroic bsod, in the blood, and dysfunction junction, no matter how extreme, can be cured with a simple whoopi epiphany speech, growing bored with insanity, a friend telling them to cop on, confiding in someone about your bad dreams, the strength or redemption offered by love, or a sickeningly sweet sidekick showing them that the power of friendship cures all wounds. The writers thus resolve the issue over the course of a single episode (or movie) and call it character development, often at a cost of willing suspension of disbelief. (On the plus side, this trope saves the audience a lot of time.)

Frequently administered by a warrior therapist or psychologist teacher. Might be heading into discredited trope territory.

Failed attempts of giving this kind of therapy might come across as activist fundamentalist antics.
