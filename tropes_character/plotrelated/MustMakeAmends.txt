A character, usually a hero, sometimes an anti-villain or anti-hero, has done something that led to terrible consequences. Often they have had the best of intentions, but due to inexperience, lack of foresight, or something else, the results were the opposite of what they wanted and intended.

It is the thing that happens next that defines must make amends: the character will do everything in their power to undo the thing they've done or caused. It might have been the death of a loved one, helping a tyrant to power, or something else. If they succeed and receive gratitude, think nothing of it is likely to follow; gratitude only reminds them of what they did to cause the problem.

Compare the atoner, who is usually making up for a whole set of bad deeds following a heel-face turn or kick the morality pet, while must make amends is usually about a specific bad deed that can come from any type of tragic mistake. redemption quest is a sister trope. Contrast buy them off.
