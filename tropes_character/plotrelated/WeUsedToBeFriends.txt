Our true companions, badass crew, five-man band - whatever - are pretty close. They share a tight relationship, trust and protect each other, would die for each other, if it might be necessary.

Only, what's this? One or several members of the team, make(s) a mistake or the wrong call.

or they just become evil for some reason.

The reasons might vary, but bottom line is, the once tight bond between the character(s) in question and his former friend(s) is severely damaged, if not completely broken. Instead of love and sympathy, at least one of them feels aversion, distrust, disdain for the other. Whether they start actively fighting each other or simply share a broken bond and avoid each other will vary, but since things sometimes don't work out the way they are supposed to, they can't reconcile by the end of the episode.

In contrast to a member being put on a bus (which doesn't necessarily mean these two tropes can't coincide), this trope focuses on the extraction of a character from his usual environment, due to aversion, distrust or a misunderstanding. However, the character is being kept as a part of the story, which is what differs this from simply being put on a bus - the extracted character is not being dropped by the writers.

This situation might eventually be resolved by things slowly getting back to normal or it doesn't.

Might trigger a beard of sorrow, 10-minute retirement, face-heel turn, heel-face turn, a degree in badassery or a despair event horizon. the list goes on and on.

Contrast with heel-face turn, compare with achilles in his tent, deus exit machina, my greatest failure, grey and gray morality and jumping off the slippery slope. Compare evil former friend. See also cain and abel, when the former friends in question were either siblings with each other, or were childhood friends who grew up with each other prior to their falling out.

The song by the Dandy Warhols is the trope namer, it being the theme from Veronica Mars kinda figures.
