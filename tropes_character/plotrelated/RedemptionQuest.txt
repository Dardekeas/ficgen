Maybe your character was the cape, but fell on bad times. Maybe he was an anti-hero who made a mistake and went flying off the slippery slope. They could even be a villain protagonist or anti-villain who is interested in redemption, either because they've kept their standards, or because they've been in conflict with an even worse villain and shown hints that there might be some good left in them after all. Whatever the case may be, the character is in a bad place but wants to do better, and they are granted one final chance to do so, usually in the form of a grand, nearly impossible task.

Maybe they're being asked to prevent the end of the world as we know it, or to cure the virus, or to stop the evil overlord. they may not be expected to live through this, but if they can pull it off no one can say that they haven't cleared their name, regained their honor, or insured an afterlife in good old fluffy cloud heaven. (That said, you may wind up with a case of redemption earns life instead.)

Sometimes done in a quieter way as character development in a non-fantasy setting, where a character is looking to undo a past mistake or wrong to a love one that has haunted them or caused misery for people around them. Also known to happen in sports movies, where a character may see one last great year or performance as a redemption of their prior deeds or careers.

A sub-trope of the hero's journey and must make amends. Usually follows a heel realization, nice job breaking it, hero or someone saying what the hell, hero?. Naturally, a staple of the atoner. An alternative to redemption equals death. Often a result of go and sin no more. Contrast redemption failure.
