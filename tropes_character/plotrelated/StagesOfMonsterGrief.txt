Characters who have been transformed from human into something else tend to get quite a shock, and change as much in morality and mind as they do in body. Much like the five stages of grief in real life, these formerly human characters may transition from stage to stage, though not necessarily in any order.

The usual first stage is Denial, the character pretends nothing is different, often harming himself and/or others when their horror hunger goes uncontrolled, they ignore their new weaksauce weakness, or their human mask slips. If they aren't Driven to Suicide by taking a sunlit stroll, they reach Defiance, where they take out their anger at no longer being human out on the "things that made me this way!" This can get ethically messy if not all non-humans are evil, leading to van helsing hate crimes.

Speaking of whom, a few manage to hold on to their sense of morality and identity and reach Acceptance. These characters range from friendly neighborhood vampires to fully embraced fiends. They don't deny what they are, or bear grudges against their fellows, but in making peace with their non-human nature they may have also distanced themselves from humanity, no longer viewing it as a group they belong to or should give equal consideration to. It is however possible they form a monsters anonymous group to try to live among humans peaceably.

Which leads to potentially the most dangerous stage of Monster Grief... for humanity. When the former human reaches Betrayal, they consider themselves above base humanity and view it as toys, food, or insignificant specks. If they uphold a masquerade, it's only because humans have sheer numbers on their side and it's more fun to pull the strings from behind the curtain and prey on humanity from the shadows.

Compare sheep in wolf's clothing, when a human who's been infected uses their "new allegiance" to betray the monsters in favor of their human friends.
