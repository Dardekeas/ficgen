Sometimes, in a mystery, or a police or law procedural, the writers will have a criminal who is intentionally sympathetic to the audience; sometimes to amplify the drama, sometimes to make the problem a true moral dilemma, and sometimes just because the story is ripped from the headlines, and the sympathetic part is necessary to get to the Headline in question.

Note that the crime in question need not necessarily be murder; the title comes from the fact that, in these shows, the crime is always murder.

This trope can also show up in other genres, but its natural stomping grounds are mystery or some kind of procedural. Expect the victim to have been an asshole.

See also manslaughter provocation, and ineffectual sympathetic villain for those who put the "pathetic" in "sympathetic". If the character was introduced and fleshed out before he was revealed to be a murderer, it's sympathetic murder backstory. See also asshole victim for cases where the murder is sympathetic primarily because the victim was so unsympathetic.

 Although truth in television, its controversial nature would be glorifying murderers.
