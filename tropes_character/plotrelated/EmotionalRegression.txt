For the most part, as someone grows older they become more mature and grounded in reality. They pass by the immaturity of their younger days and become an adult.

But there is a phenomenon where in a specific situation a person may turn from their confident adult personality and revert into a nervous teenage (or younger) incarnation. It may be because of interacting with an old friend and they reminisce about all their old activities they did together. Or maybe they have found themselves re-enacting a situation from their past they thought they had grown past, such as breaking up with a long-time partner and finding themselves back in the dating pool. Then there are the supernatural and "bump on the head" reasons.

A common gag with this involves a parental substitute where a "more mature" friend may have to be the voice of reason and they bicker with things like "You don't understand me!"

Compare personality swap, helpless good side, man child and one of the kids.
