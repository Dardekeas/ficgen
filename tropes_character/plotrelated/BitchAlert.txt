Sometimes writers love to tease us a little with who's nice and who's not so nice in the story. Not this time, though.

The character enters the scene and she's clearly trouble. Tall, slender, regal bearing, pretentious walk, looking down on every one, long nails and pulls out icy, cutting sarcasm the minute she opens her mouth... That's right, we have a Bitch Alert and it's so blatant you could actually have this caption blinking on the screen/panel as soon as she appears.

Usually applies to the alpha bitch, rich bitch, femme fatale and many other types of villainesses.

This is a very obvious type of establishing character moment.

Never applies to the bitch in sheep's clothing, since this one isn't hiding her bitchiness behind a sweet, welcoming face. Au contraire, she is rather pretty upfront and direct about it.

Compare make way for the princess, for the typical high school variation.
