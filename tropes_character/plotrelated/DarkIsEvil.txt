Darkness is associated with evil, ugliness, scary monsters, and super creeps. This is the reason for the naming of the dark side and why evil counterpart characters and certain underground monkeys often have 'dark' in front of their names. Like all colour-coded for your convenience/good colors, evil colors examples, this is common, but not universal, and will vary from culture to culture.

The logic behind the trope is as follows: most humans fear the dark, at least to some degree; our sight is the sense we depend on the most, and we cannot see well in darkness, therefore a lack of light makes us feel very vulnerable to danger. Furthermore, the fact that it's so hard to see in darkness (well, for humans, anyways) has caused some of us to associate darkness with deception. Evil is associated with deception as well, so, from Star Wars to cowboy movies, a lot of bad guys wear black hats. If you want to be even more obvious about it, give the bad guy a name that has something to do with darkness.

If a character has darkness-based powers, see casting a shadow.

Stories where Dark Is Evil and light is not good are commonplace to show that the light can be just as foul as darkness.

Why evil is not well lit, and why having the sun vanish is a bad sign. See also light is good, bad powers, bad people, and obviously evil.

A super trope to evil wears black. Black is the favorite color of the card-carrying villain, as it is associated with the color of death in the western world. Vampires, witches and necromancers are also traditionally seen in black garb.

dark is not evil is the inversion and the good counterpart of this trope. Another one is the sacred darkness, where Dark may or may not be evil, but is just as important as Light.
