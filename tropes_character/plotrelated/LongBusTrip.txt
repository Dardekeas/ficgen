A long bus trip is when a character is put on a bus in such a way that arranging a return would be simple, but then the character never actually comes back. This is most striking when the audience only learns of it retroactively, especially when the character was intended or hinted to be returning. It may also occur as the result of a series being left hanging.

character outlives actor is a form of this enforced by real life. When it's the result of author existence failure, that's the character died with him.

When this is done to a character in-story as a coverup for execution, it's released to elsewhere.

Compare chuck cunningham syndrome and put on a bus to hell. Contrast bus crash (which kills the character outright) and back for the dead (when the character returns briefly, only to be killed off), and the bus came back for that one single return.

The image is of a truly long bus from the TransMilenio bus rapid transit (a rapid transit mode that can be thought of as "the future of transit") system in Bogot√°, Colombia. This has since been taken up in other countries: when the "Bendy Buses" arrived in England, at first there were little calamities when drivers who under-estimated their length tried to manouevre them around nineteenth century road corners designed for horse and cart. It's also being taken up in chicago, with a planned BRT on Ashland Avenue.
