Sometimes to make a heroic sacrifice, a hero doesn't need to die. Sometimes he must sacrifice something else... his good name, his reputation and his integrity.

A character attempting a Zero Approval Gambit will knowingly risk - or deliberately seek - a 0% approval rating and paint himself in a bad light in order to achieve some greater good. This might involve falsely confessing to a crime he didn't commit, or it might involve him being an enormous jerkass contrary to his usual nature. The net result is that he will be hated, hunted or disgraced for all time. In short, he willingly becomes a hero with bad publicity. Note that this isn't a short-term trick. A Zero Approval Gambit is usually permanent or takes a huge amount of work to undo.

This is an inverse of villain with good publicity; compare good is not nice, necessarily evil, noble demon, what the hell, hero?, break his heart to save him. Can result in a hero with an f in good. Sometimes done to facilitate a genghis gambit. Often a job hazard of the agent provocateur. Most of the time it involves becoming a silent scapegoat.
