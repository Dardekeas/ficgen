The polar opposite of chickification and a subtrope of adaptational badass. We all know girls need role models and real women don't wear dresses, so what do you do when you're adapting or sequelizing a work from a "less enlightened" time? Make your female lead into an action girl!

The title comes from Xena: Warrior Princess, who is not an example but rather the inspiration, being something of a trope codifier for action girl. Xenafication thus can be defined as "becoming like Xena". At least once, this has been lampshaded by having the character go "ayiyiyiyiyiyi!" before kicking ass. Related to took a level in badass and adrenaline makeover. Sometimes a specific form of adaptational badass. Not to be confused with xenofiction.
