If you treat one person like dirt, you're an asshole. If you treat a group of people like dirt, you're prejudiced and a bigot. If you treat everyone like dirt you are... kind of okay. At very least, it says "Evil? maybe. But petty? never!".

The social version of a million is a statistic. May be used as an anti-hero trait in cases like noble bigot with a badge.

This can be truth in television. The term for this kind of person is 'misanthrope', they usually manage to function within society, and can form normal relationships with other humans. Indeed, it's considered an asset for humorists (H.L. Mencken being the prime example).
