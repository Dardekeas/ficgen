Sometimes good is not nice, hence a hero can be obnoxious and rude. Similarly, sometimes an affably evil villain could be friendly or polite. When either or both of these work their way into to the tone of a conversation between a hero and a villain, you end up with conversations in which the villains sound more respectful than the heroes.

Depending on how this is treated in the context of a story, it could serve as a pet the dog moment, or alternatively, it could serve as a sign that the villains really, REALLY don't deserve respect and hence the heroes will not give it to them. Then again, that would by its very nature imply the villain's at least humble enough to be polite to the heroes... or at least not too proud to pretend to be.

Can be a sign that evil cannot comprehend good — the villain sees the hero as a worthy opponent who happens to be working at cross-purposes to him, but doesn't understand the hero's visceral hatred of everything he stands for. It can also be a character flaw for the anti-hero, who when confronted by evil may act so tactlessly as to seriously disgrace his own reputation.

Sometimes, the moral is that actions speak louder than words; while the villain in the picture might be speaking courteously, there is the small matter that he is at the same time handing the hero over to his resident torture technician. Some works take it so far that the moral seems to be "politeness is deceptive, bluntness is honest" — a message that all those reality show contestants who "speak [their] mind and don't care what anyone thinks" must have taken to heart.
