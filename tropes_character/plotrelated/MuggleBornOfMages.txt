children of superparents get superpowers... except when they don't.

If you're a protagonist, this is no problem, you'll usually become a badass normal or at least an unfazed everyman. But if you're a mauve shirt... you'll probably become this.

This trope is a character who's in on the masquerade, and was born into their world. Unfortunately for him, he's normal. No, not badass normal, totally, completely and 100% normal. He's just as ineffectual in adventuring as any other muggle, maybe even more, which is why he usually has some grunt-work position in the world of the masquerade, such as a janitor, secretary, or the igor. He may be nice-if-pathetic or mean-spirited, but whatever the case, his bitterness and regret over not being a super is a major character trait.

It may ultimately turn out that this person is actually a power nullifier, though this might not be noticed immediately. If this is common in the setting, it may be that characters are completely randomly gifted, so powers aren't always inherited and may spontaneously manifest to children of muggle parents.

This trope is somewhat newer than you think, since magic-users traditionally learned/sold their soul for their powers, meaning that a child born of a mage would normally be human.

Contrast almighty janitor, badass normal. Compare un-sorcerer and unfazed everyman. A subversion of lamarck was right.
