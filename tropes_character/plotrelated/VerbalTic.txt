An exceptionally (narf!) odd catch phrase used to the point it seems more like a bodily emission than speaking. This is often a single nonsense word added at the end of sentences, well past the expected formal variations in speech, eh? It can, ah say, it can also be a word, sound, or phrase that shows up in various places in a character's dialogue. In Japanese, character tics that occur at the end of sentences are referred to as "kyara-gobi" (キャラ語尾, chara(cter) word/sentence ending).

Contrast with strange syntax speaker, where the character is using language rules unknown to others. See also character tics, for similar idiosyncrasies applied to physical behavior. A musical variant is lyrical tic. third-person person is a specific tic where the speaker refers to themselves in third-person.
