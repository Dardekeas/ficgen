Heroes save people, even enemies. What's more, if a hero saves a rival or villain enough times, you'd expect them to change their attitude towards the hero into one of at least grudging respect or having honor dictate that they "owe them one".You'd be wrong.

Heroes don't always get gratitude, recognition, or even a basic "thank you" for their efforts, and sometimes, any thanks are patently insincere. Rivals and enemies in particular tend to treat these saves with the same gratitude for the air they breathe (read, none). And that's if they aren't actively angry at being put through the ignominy of being saved by those filthy  they'll usually betray such mercy at the first opportunity. Ungrateful Bastards.

This is true even if it's a forced enemy mine situation, and he never even acknowledges the service rendered or is grateful, much less gets character development or a change in their relationship to reset. This might be done either to show how utterly evil (or at least callous) the enemy is, and avoid having the show's formula change with the big bad growing unable to kill or hate someone who has saved them so often.

Contrast grudging thank you. Probably not related to the inglourious kind. See also entitled bastard.
