A stereotypical hollywood nerd who, despite being a grown adult is still an adolescent right down to living with his parents. While the decor of their poster-gallery bedroom is subject to the tastes of the character, be sure there will be a computer to communicate with the outside world. It's always played for laughs as an acceptable lifestyle target. More importantly, the subject is always male. There is little stigma to a female character living at home, and in some cultures it might even be expected. This makes the trope a huge double standard against men as well (but see below).

The guys who are depicted in this condition usually fit into one of the following:

 Lazy and unwilling to earn a living for himself.

 Childish and requires everything to be done for him.

  Technically Thank goodness those don't sound like nerd stereotypes, or we could be in real trouble. This trope has become much, MUCH less stigmatizing in real life, however, where the economy has been sending more and more adults back to their parents' homes. And if this article is any indication, this trope could even become discredited at some point in the future.Note that living with one's parents is a stigma mainly in the USA and other Anglosphere countries, where working-age adults are expected to live on their own, so this trope shouldn't be applied to characters from cultures where this is the norm.

For a more serious treatment of this as a social problem, see hikikomori. Not to be confused with madwoman in the attic. Compare the hermit.
