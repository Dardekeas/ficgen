A variation on the odd couple, involving a white person and a black person. Usually, the white person is a strait-laced by-the-book type, while the black person is a funky, urban type who doesn't have much respect for authority. Most commonly, they're cops, assigned as partners after their old partners die/get disgusted and walk away. Generally, the two make a fairly good team if they can work out the personality clashes, with the strengths of one covering for the weaknesses of the other.

Salt And Pepper seems to be becoming subverted more often today due to increased racial awareness, so that it's the white person who's a rebellious hothead, and the black person is smart and savvy. Another common subversion is for the black guy to be uptight and the white guy to be relaxed. An alternate version is a pairing of a white character with a Hispanic character called a Cafe con Leche. Please note, however, that being two different races isn't enough for this trope. There must be some kind of contrast in their personalities for it to work.

For American media, this may be more common in the movies (Lethal Weapon, ) than on TV as television shows often seem more segregated.

See also black best friend. irishman and a jew is an older variation of this trope. If they're not different races, the trope is all work vs. all play.
