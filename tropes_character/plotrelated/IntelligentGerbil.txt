A phrase coined by sci-fi author robert j sawyer, describing a certain way of characterizing extraterrestrial races. Take a terrestrial animal, make it anthropomorphic, bipedal, and sapient, but rather than derive their behavior from humans with the occasional furry reminder, instead derive the majority of its characterization and culture from the terrestrial animal's behavior. Sawyer's hypothetical/satirical Intelligent Gerbils live in cities powered by erudite individuals running around in big wheels; they take water from tubes coming out of the walls and sleep in piles of cedar chips.

Could be regarded as the animal version of rubber-forehead aliens, except when the non-human psychology clause of starfish aliens kicks in. Distinct from alien animals in the sense that they're not literally a terrestrial animal, but are obviously inspired by one. Compare bee people.

A subtrope of petting zoo people, and related to funny animal, civilized animal, and the planet of hats. These mainly rely on animal stereotypes but also usually end up looking like humanoid aliens, for obvious reasons. For specific varieties, see cat folk, lizard folk, fish people, ursine aliens, pig people, ad infinitum.

evolutionary levels are often implied - apparently if you want sapience, intelligence and organised society, they always come with two arms, two legs and an upright body plan.

For an interesting analysis and criticism of this trope, see this Tetrapod Zoology post.

not to be confused with works featuring actual sapient earth-native gerbils.
