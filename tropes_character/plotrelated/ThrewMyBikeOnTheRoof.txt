In essence, this is about destroying property just because you can... even though there is nothing to gain from it. being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole.

A jerkass character is walking down a sidewalk when he sees a group of young little kids playing with a ball, or a remote-controlled plane. He goes up to them all casual-like and feigns interest as they rave about their new favourite toy. Next thing you know though, the bully either borrows the toy or takes it by force and then either breaks it, throws it on top of a roof or in a body of water, takes it for his own... whatever's the cruellest way he can think of to deprive the kids of their fun. After he does this, he walks away laughing at what he's done while the poor little kids cry or shout angrily at him, hopelessly unable to do anything to fix or retrieve their toy.

Of course, this can be the moment that the local badass sees this happening and makes the Jerkass regret it by beating him up to the delight of the kids and/or making him retrieve the item or compensate for the loss.

This doesn't necessarily have to be exactly like that situation though; this trope applies to all types of jerkassery committed to all kinds of helpless people regarding their items. For example, when the Jerkass's co-worker just finished his project on a computer or whatever and is about to save it, the guy goes out of his way to pull the plug of his co-worker's computer, making the co-worker lose all his hard work.

A sub-trope of kick the dog. sister trope to for the evulz and evil is petty.
