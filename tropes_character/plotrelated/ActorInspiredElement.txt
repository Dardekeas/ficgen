Some element of a work, be it certain dialogue or the classic clothing of a character, wasn't chosen by the creators or the responsible department of the crew, but by the actor. Maybe they walked into set one day wearing leather pants and the director thought the look "just worked" for their character when the possibility had never been discussed before. Maybe they suggested that adding some lines to conversation would be beneficial to their character development.

Something an actor does with the character which the producer likes either before or after they get the role would also count. These may be examples of cast the expert. This excludes improvisations that were included in the final cut, as some precognition and crew approval is polite when you're about to overthrow their production.

This is something from real life often portrayed behind the scenes of the show within a show in-universe.

May overlap with actor-shared background, and sometimes throw it in. Compare the cast show off, when an actor uses some of their real life skills in their performance; harpo does something funny, when the writers understand that this is inevitable; the danza, when the actor names their character after themself.

When an element of a work is inspired by fans or wmg, it's ascended fanon.
