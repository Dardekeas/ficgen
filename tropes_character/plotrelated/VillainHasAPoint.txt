Time and time again a story is told with the classic hero vs. villain setup with the villain committing acts deemed evil by good, neutral, and the normally apathetic. The villain usually commits said acts for their own personal reasons. But wait, they have a justified reason for their actions? They may not be so much evil as they are anti. He may end up sending the hero into a depression after his motives come to light? Here, my friends, is a villain who actually has a justified reason for being what he is. Due to the nature of their villainy if they become too excessive in their methods they can easily fall under well-intentioned extremist. in-universe they can also easily fall under designated villain. Compare jerkass has a point, anti-villain, ambiguously evil and strawman has a point.
