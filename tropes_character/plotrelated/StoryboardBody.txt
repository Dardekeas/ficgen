A character description trope.

Due to the law of conservation of detail, characters rarely have tattoos unless they're in some way important to the character. These don't have to be some extremely significant plot point, but they usually do give us greater insight into the character's personality. The tattoos often involve symbolism of some kind related to the character's past or purpose. Many times the character will be a part of some society, such as a proud warrior race, gang bangers, or the syndicate.

Sometime this trope is played for laughs.

This trope overlaps with tattooed crook. However, in this instance the character is not always a rebel or bad guy.
