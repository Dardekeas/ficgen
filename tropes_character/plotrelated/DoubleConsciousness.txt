People sometimes have trouble defining who they truly are. Factors such as race, gender, culture, country origin, sexuality and occupation can all play a role in a person's identity. But when these things come into conflict with one another, a person may feel as if they are torn inside. They may feel as if they have two separate identities, or that their identity is divided into multiple facets.

Characters in fiction are no different. They too can sometimes suffer from a clash of identities. The superhero for example that must live double lives; one as a hero and the other as a normal citizen.

This might also result from usage of certain applied phlebotinum. If you've got brain uploading, brain washing, mind control, Alternate Universes or time travel, it can cause a lot of different thoughts, people, and even lives washing through your head. It can be difficult to sort out.

This term was coined by W.E.B DuBois in The Souls of Black Folk. He used it in reference to African-Americans who struggle between the identities of being both American and Black.

Compare secret identity identity, living a double life. In extreme cases this can lead to split personality. See also double think.
