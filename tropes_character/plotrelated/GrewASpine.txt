Bob may have opinions, but he doesn't act on them if someone disagrees. Instead, he will follow their instructions or advice. This someone might be anyone, a single person that he is dependent on, or the prevailing attitudes in society. Then Bob starts to trust and act on his own judgment, and begins to go his own way. Bob earlier had no independent judgment in relation to some external factor, and this is the growth and expression of his own judgment: he's growing a spine.

This is a form of character development, and often a defining moment in a rite of passage. It's also a staple of a coming of age story, where it does not necessarily mean that Bob has more resolve than earlier, but rather that he has learned to follow his own independent judgments. It might be lousy judgment, but at least he has started to develop and act on it.

As a trope, this can take two forms:

 A plot arc for a character. This is the long and slow variety.

 A single scene, where the character unambiguously chooses their own way in a plot-relevant fashion.

Grew a Spine is normally a big part of a coming of age story, and can be assumed to be included as part of that. Please only include such examples if Grew a Spine is the major part of the coming of age story.

Some starting points for Grew a Spine is extreme doormat or shrinking violet, but the character might just be inexperienced and unsure of themselves. After all, this is all part of growing up. May coincide with took a level in badass or sudden principled stand. Has nothing to do with the evolution of vertebrate animals.
