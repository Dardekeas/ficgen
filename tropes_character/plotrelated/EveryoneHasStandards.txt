Whether someone is a weirdo, villain, pervert, jerkass, geek etc. deviant from the customs of "normal" society â€” one often finds those things that can only go so far. These characters find that when they're in a situation where they would cross a certain line, they don't do it. Or they get disgusted at those who do cross that line.

A super trope to even evil has standards, even nerds have standards, even beggars won't choose it.

Compare conscience makes you go back, sudden principled stand.
