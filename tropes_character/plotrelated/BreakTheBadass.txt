When the audience needs to be shown how physically dangerous an enemy is, the creators invoke the worf effect, or maybe they throw a sacrificial lamb (or worse, a sacrificial lion) in the path of the bad guy. But when the producers don't feel like killing one of their characters yet, but still need to show the audience just how dangerous the situation is, they often resort to breaking the badass by having the hardest, coldest, roughest, toughest, most jaded and violent, seen-it-all character become shocked out of their wits by it.

When this is done to villains, it is often in the form of even evil has standards. Related to not so above it all and sarcasm failure. Contrast admiring the abomination, where scientific curiosity makes a character get excited (if still scared) at the sight of a monster.

Expect oh, crap or mass "oh, crap!" reactions. Can sometimes invoke anyone can die.
