This is similar to personality powers, but with weapons. Basically, in various works of fiction, characters tend to possess weapons that are either a direct reflection of their personality or the traits commonly deemed to their character type.

This is why you don't see ogres with rapiers or ninjas with clubs. The martial arts allow this trope to survive as pastimes prove personality.

                            Of course, any true Troper's Weapon of Choice would have to be a big freakin' gatling shotgun that can be dual wielded with a detachable chain-bladed laser katana. Anything else just pales in comparison, save for the giga drill breaker. If there is a five-man band, the weapons will probably be heroes prefer swords, blade on a stick, luckily my shield will protect me, simple staff, and/or magic wand. For non-weapon examples, see tell me how you fight. Contrast choice of two weapons. See also good weapon, evil weapon. See weapon jr. for when someone's shown with a weapon of choice before they've chosen it. For an entire culture's Weapon Of Choice, see national weapon.
