In fiction, being overweight doesn't necessarily mean you're probably a bad person...Maybe you're just stupid. In any group of characters the fattest one will probably be the dimmest.

Granted poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle is not necessarily a clever lifestyle choice (leaving aside more complicated real life reasons for weight gain that are unlikely to be portrayed in fiction), but many tubby characters seem to think of literally nothing else other than eating. Even if they are good, the fat character is generally a comic ditz.

This trope is particularly popular in animation.

See also fat bastard, fat slob, and shorter means smarter. Often an element of a straw loser. Contrast lean and mean.
