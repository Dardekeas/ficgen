In real life one of the easiest ways to be left alone is to wear a pair of headphones. Either you won't be able to hear other people, or they will assume that you can't hear them. This carries over into fiction. It is an easy way to show that a character is trying to drown out reality and other people. Is either used symbolically, where the headphones are a side-effect of their isolation, or deliberately when the character does this on purpose.

The scary shiny glasses can often do this too, in a creepier fashion.

It's also possible to use this impression to gather information: If people assume you can't hear or aren't paying attention, they might talk freely behind your back, and if you don't actually have the headphones playing any sound, you should be able to hear them with just a little muffling. On the negative side, using them while exercising may lead to joggers find death. Possibly moving towards discredited trope territory now that traditional bulky headphones are being replaced with tiny iTunes-style earbuds, however, some works may deliberately invoke it by having a character choose large headphones over earbuds precisely for this reason.

Wearing headphones doesn't tune everything out in real life - smells, the floor rumbling, etc - but can be used this way in fiction for the rule of funny.
