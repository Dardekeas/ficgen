There's nothing quite like the presence of many happy couples to rub their single status in for the lovelorn, whatever their reason for being single.

This can be a scene with an improbable number of couples in, say, a park, or the character particularly noticing couples wherever he goes. This tends to be either a crowd of couples the same age as the character, or a vast range, from young lovers wooing, to happily married couples with perhaps a baby, to still affectionate elderly couples.

The couples are bit characters; contrast beta couple, where one happy couple is further developed and provides the contrast to the character.

Supertrope of the world mocks your loss. Compare alone in a crowd and third wheel. Contrast lonely together.
