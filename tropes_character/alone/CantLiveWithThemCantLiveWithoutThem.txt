A development often used in buddy films and romantic comedy. One person, often a loner-type, is paired off with someone else against his/her will.

He can't stand the person/situation and wishes for his old routine. When he gets his old routine back, he suddenly realizes he misses that person a lot and does everything in his power to get her back. Usually, happens when a bickering pair become vitriolic best buds, or generate an aww, look! they really do love each other situation, whether it's a fraternal sort of love among buddies, or romantic love.

Sometimes subverted to "Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em".

See also odd couple.

Compare we want our jerk back (when the resident deadpan snarker's presence is sorely missed), belligerent sexual tension.
