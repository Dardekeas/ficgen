So, you are a writer, and you establish, for the purposes of building up drama and depth, that a character is the last of his kind. However, this severely restricts the options available to you, especially if we have previously seen others of his kind, who are now, obviously, gone.

Therefore, very often, at least for the heroic sort, it will eventually turn out that he's not really the last of his kind after all, and his fellows have either been secreted away or ascended to a higher plane of existence, or new ones have come into being somehow. Unless this is revealed in the grand finale or when the character is put on a bus, this revelation will either prove a macguffin (as the character will now be driven to actually find and reunite with his fellows), or be conveniently removed by a reset button (for example, these other survivors will be killed, or permanently sealed away in another dimension for their own protection, turning out to be a dream, chuck cunningham syndrome or whatnot), as being reunited with his people pretty much cancels out the character type. See sailor earth for when a fanfiction writer creates this type of character.
