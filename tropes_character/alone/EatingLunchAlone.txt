When someone is eating lunch alone in a communal context (school, army, etc.), it means he or she is being actively shunned by everyone else, or the student is the New Kid and has not yet made any friends. It rarely ever means that he chose to eat lunch by himself. Often, their return into the fold will be symbolized by someone else accepting to have lunch with them. Or if they keep their outcast status, having lunch with them will be a sign of independence of mind and refusing to follow the herd.

May end up being the fate of the alpha bitch when her poor treatment of others comes back to haunt her.

Very much truth in television. There are introverted people who enjoy the solitude, and even extraverts with normal social lives are known to do it for various reasons. More rarely, there are numerous anxiety disorders that can make one extremely self-conscious and uncomfortable about having others watch them eat.
