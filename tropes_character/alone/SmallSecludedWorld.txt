The character(s) live in a small secluded world. It could be a pocket dimension, middle-of-nowhere street, an island without communication with the outside world, a spaceship lost on the void, a special kind of prison, or something else that has the same effect. If there is any contact at all with an outside world, then this contact is very limited.

When there doesn't seem to be any world outside the small secluded world, then this trope overlaps with world limited to the plot. If there is an outside world, characters who grew up secluded from it are very likely to be naive to it. They might mistakenly believe themselves to understand their world â€” be ignorant of their own ignorance. Alternatively, the characters are completely unaware that there exists an outside world at all: there's only the city in a bottle.

In any case, living in such narrow boundaries is likely to affect the characters negatively. They might get depressed, desperate to get out, or even fail to comprehend that anything larger then their Small Secluded World exists.

May often have a wall around the world. Any hidden elf village or ominous floating castle is likely to qualify for this trope if the characters are forced to live there for a while. Also, any case of ontological mystery is likely to also be a case of small secluded world or world limited to the plot, or both.

Compare with bottle episode, where the characters are only locked in a secluded world, the bottle, for a single episode. Contrast with the outside world.

 In  Hender's Island in the sci-fi novel 'Fragment' by Warren Fahy is the last surviving remnant of the original supercontinent, where evolution has progressed in complete isolation for over 400 million years. Most of the island's life forms, including the single intelligent species, are highly evolved terrestrial stomatopods - i.e mantis shrimp.

 In "The Tunnel Under the World" by Frederick Pohl, a man wakes up from a terrible nightmare and it's always the same day, over and over again. He doesn't realize this until he falls asleep in his basement and then sees what is happening. As it turns out the entire town was destroyed by a chemical plant explosion and the minds of the dead bodies were put in robot bodies to test advertising.

 Even the most remote islands in the world aren't as secluded from the rest of the world as they once used to be. Still, many lonely islands and archipelagos in the South Atlantic and the southern Antarctic seas are amongst the most secluded places on the Earth (to the point that you might feel like on a different planet entirely).
