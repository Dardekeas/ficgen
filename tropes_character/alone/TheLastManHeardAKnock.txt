Whenever there is but a single living soul left on earth in an after the end scenario, we know that no matter how lonely it seems, there will always be other people left on Earth. Or perhaps zombies. or a helpful dog. There always are. When it comes to exceptions, there are next to none. And even better: They are somewhere relatively close to him, and will run into him, despite the fact that Earth (or even a major city) is a pretty big place and it should be unbelievably easy to miss each other; generally, however, the second party is making an active effort to find the first, and such handwaves as "I tracked your radio" emerge in short order.

The reason this trope exists, of course, is to take the burden off a single actor. For the most part, stories focused on a single person who never encounters others are boring unless that person is an excellent actor (or the writer is brilliant) - it's interaction that makes for entertainment. Plus, it opens up more potential for conflict, often called the driving force of fiction.

See also there is another, lonely together. If it really is a chance meeting, it also invokes the trope of it's a small world after all.
