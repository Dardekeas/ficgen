A huge threat has raised its evil head. This threat is a danger to the entire nation/planet/galactic empire, and has already done a lot of damage. However, the government doesn't do the obvious thing to fight this oncoming hazard (rally the troops, send out the Marines, and use its full resources to destroy the threat once and for all). Instead they send in one man.

Now, the man might be a highly trained operative but he is still only one man. No one questions the government's choice in sending out one special guy, either. This is not a desperation move, as in Halo, where one guy is all the government has left... no, in cases like this, the choice is usually "send the entire fleet" or "send Joe".

A common handwave/justification for this trope is that a full military assault would draw unwanted attention to the operation. As in, if we send an army to attack the secret base, the villain will use his superweapon, and game over. If we send Joe then villain won't react so intensely, and we can get past his guard. More realistically, the entire army may be needed to hold the villain's army at bay, or slow them down long enough to give Joe time to stop the villain. In other words, this trope is when the government is genre savvy about a one-man army.

If Joe makes a habit of succeeding at these missions he'll get a reputation for doing the impossible.

This trope is most often seen in first-person shooter video games, though it's sometimes often seen in movies and television shows.

Related to it's up to you and the only one. It can involve conservation of ninjutsu. Contrast surprisingly elite cannon fodder, which is where a scrappy ragtag bunch of misfits is sent out on an impossible task rather than an obvious badass.
