See that man over there? You know, the one who lives in the spooky house and never comes outside, and is always glaring at you out the window? He must be evil, right? Yeah! After all, everyone knows that loners are freaks. If he doesn't interact with any of us, that means he's a monster!

Except...he's not evil at all. He's not a jerkass. He's not even a jerk with a heart of gold; he's just misunderstood.

This character is automatically assumed to be evil due to his solitude, but turns out to have a heart of gold. He appears most often in kiddy programs to deliver that age-old "don't judge a book by its cover" aesop. He may have some dark secret which, while goodhearted, seems sinister, or needs to be covered up to keep the masquerade.

Compare crazy cat lady, madwoman in the attic, the hermit, and the bait-and-switch tyrant. See also subverted suspicion aesop, where one person says someone is evil while everyone assumes it's just slander, and it turns out to be true. Related to dark is not evil and all of the other reindeer.

Spoilers ahead, Captain!
