you might be the last of your kind or someone else made a heroic sacrifice for you, but whatever the reason, you're going to feel a massive sense of guilt. An easy way to generate angst. Expect this to occur when the mary sue dies or a husband survives the death of his family. Practically a guarantee in cases of death by childbirth, or when one is a sole survivor.

Can also lead to the victim becoming a death seeker or failure knight. May cause bad dreams, drowning my sorrows, and various other ways to cope, while trusted friends and/or professionals plead with him to realize that he has nothing to beat himself up about. Contrast you should have died instead, where one survivor tries to evoke survivor guilt in another.

truth in television: Survivor's Guilt is a common symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, especially among suicide witnesses.
