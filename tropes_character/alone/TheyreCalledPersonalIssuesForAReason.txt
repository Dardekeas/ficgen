keeping secrets sucks. We all know that. However, sometimes, the only thing that sucks more is telling those dark secrets. Not as common as some other stock aesops due to its status as a somewhat family unfriendly one. It serves as either a subversion or aversion of the common belief that friends don't keep secrets from friends. The idea behind this is that everybody has certain things that they'd really rather not have to say, and it isn't right to force people to say those things just to satiate one's curiosity. Say the atoner wants to start over after his dark and troubled past, for example. Or say someone doesn't want anyone to find out about a tragedy that affected them previously and offer undesired sympathy. On the other hand, this usually does come with an exemption for if there's something they're keeping secret that affects you directly.

It can also be used as a handwave in order to keep the masquerade going. Basically, a stranger comes to town and ingratiates himself in a group. Usually, this will be a main character. In order to explain why no one in the group is curious about just why this person walking the earth has just wandered into town, this aesop is invoked. Sometimes, this can also be the explanation for an unusually uninteresting sight.

See also there are no therapists. Note in real life, an experiment where people who didn't want to talk about their problems were randomly assigned to do so or not, the group that talked about them felt more miserable than the control, so this can certainly be truth in television.
