the loner learned his lesson. He will no longer declare i work alone; he has made friends and learned to trust them.

So why is he sneaking about with secrets? aesop amnesia?

Nah, just bad habits. One of his true companions just has to remind him of the power of friendship and the power of trust. Let it be known that his mistrust is hurtful. Distinguishable from aesop amnesia in that they do not have to learn the lesson over again; the reminder often suffices, for an explanation of secrecy if not an actual explanation.

A form of character development more realistic than simple epiphany therapy at that.

Sometimes needed when the character learns new things and tries to keep them secret. Sometimes can be dangerous, if there are good reasons for secrecy.
