captain lonerguy has just been offered by an equal to team up. Perhaps it is an out-of-town cape looking for help on a case that wandered into the Captain's turf. Or his enemy needs help fighting off a power worse than the both of them. If Captain Lonerguy is lucky, it is an equally matched love interest, regardless what side she's on.

In any of these situations, the answer will always be the same. "I work alone."Cue in audience eyerolling as they must now sit through several scenes of Captain Lonerguy getting his ass handed to him, only to be rescued by said offerer, just so that he can learn an aesop about the power of friendship... or at least strength in numbers. (Even, mind you, if it turns out that he's an informed loner â€” he actually doesn't seem to be alone a lot.)

Occasionally, (and especially if they've had a partner or sidekick die on them) they will strenuously refuse partnering with a reckless sidekick, and/or harass new helpers who are competent.

Even after they have learned their lesson, they may have to hear remember that you trust me to keep it going.

-OR-

the hero really doesn't need other's help and is more badass for saying so. cowboy cops and heroes that actually enjoy their solitude count in this type. A form of good is not nice. think nothing of it and don't you dare pity me! are common. Of course, saying this line can sometimes be tempting fate, and in this particular instance, the usually competent hero might for once find himself in way over his head, and will, often reluctantly, accept the offer of help.

Contrast with i just want to have friends, true companions, or you are not alone.

-OR-

The hero knows that they are the only one who can deal with a problem, and wants to protect everyone else. If they do team up, they're likely to make a sneaky departure and go fight the big bad alone before it gets ugly.
