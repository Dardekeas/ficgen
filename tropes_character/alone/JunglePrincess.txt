The distaff counterpart of tarzan of the Apes, this is a young woman of European extraction who has been raised in a jungle environment, usually by animals. Despite her upbringing, though, she has managed to grasp the basic rudiments of english, tools and fashion â€” she is frequently seen wearing fetching leather or fur bikinis and wielding a spear. She is far more likely to have rapunzel hair than wild hair, and her legs and armpits will be inexplicably hairless.

For some unfathomable reason, the animals of the jungle obey her slavishly instead of viewing her as lunch, and the woefully benighted hollywood natives treat her as a goddess. If the Jungle Princess is particularly naive, she'll buy into that belief. Even if she's not particularly naive and although she may well possess some fearsomely strong instincts and drives toward it, her isolation from humans has left her with no concept whatsoever of romance.

Inevitably, she will encounter a hunky european explorer (rather than a - perish the thought - relationship with a native) usually by rescuing him from some local danger, and they will fall in love. While the movie version of the Jungle Princess will then let her explorer bring her back home and civilize her, the TV version will not allow it, and instead he finds himself settling down in Malaria Central and stealing kisses from her when she's not busy ordering lions to savage the occasional poacher.

In science fiction, many a green-skinned space babe is just a jungle princess with a dye job and a zap gun.

The trope name ultimately dates to a 1920 silent film serial called The Jungle Princess, but its common usage probably dates from the 1936 film of the same name starring Dorothy Lamour.

See also nubile savage. Not to be confused with the chief's daughter, where the leading lady actually fits the native culture (but is almost always a princess for some reason).
