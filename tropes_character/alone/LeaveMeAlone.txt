Phrase said by somebody who is about to try solving everything by themselves, and will screw things up really, really badly. Or somebody who has already screwed everything up.

Anyone who refuses help with this phrase is convinced that they need keep their problems secret and solve them on their own. This can only end one way: learning an aesop about pride. Unless they say "leave me alone" and then add, "nothing's wrong" or "I can take care of myself" or "it's none of your business". In that case, they've screwed up even more badly, and may get themselves killed before they can learn their valuable lesson. Remember, loners are freaks and friends are good for you.

Of course, every now and then there's a character who is so badass that they really can handle everything themselves. They never say "Leave Me Alone". They say "you'll have to trust me" or "don't help me when I don't want to be helped" or something that sounds equally high-minded. Unless, of course, they resort to the classic "Stay out of my way," in which case an aesop about teamwork may not be far off.

Compare don't you dare pity me! and think nothing of it, both of which can express this in certain situations.
