Everything comes down to a one-on-one fight between the hero and whoever has been his worst antagonist in the current plot. The hero's friends and reinforcements show up in time to intervene and give the hero a decisive victory with their overwhelming numbers and/or firepower, but they don't — or the hero won't let them — because "This is something he's got to do himself."This tactic might be a way to counter the ill effects of the conservation of ninjutsu...

This is the logical extension of it's personal, the cousin of leave him to me, and often stems from honor before reason. Also see i work alone for denying help from the beginning. There's also locked out of the fight, where the hero does want help but circumstances contrive to prevent the helpers from helping. Compare shoo out the clowns. Contrast in the end, you are on your own, where the helpers can't be of any help even if they wanted to. See also what you are in the dark. Also contrast figure it out yourself, where the bystanders could help, but don't, even if you ask, as well as i can't do this by myself.

Contrast helping would be killstealing, for when it's a matter of experience and personal growth rather than honor or revenge.
