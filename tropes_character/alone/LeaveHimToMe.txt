The villain is furious. the hero and his allies have defeated his elite force and stolen his macguffin. In grand evil overlord fashion, he stands up and orders every man he has to attack the hero's entourage. But as for the hero himself: "Leave him to me!"/"He's mine!" Unless the villain is sufficiently badass enough to be a good match for the hero one-on-one, this is generally never a good idea.

The tendency of villains to order the hero captured alive or ignored on the battlefield so that they can have the satisfaction of killing him themselves, the result of it's personal, and the evil version of this is something he's got to do himself, almost always backfires. Considering that the villain's form of killing the hero is to put him in an easily escapable deathtrap, maybe the mooks should disregard the order...

Contrast the rest shall pass which is the heroic version of this trope. If the hero and villain are on speaking terms, this can manifest itself as the only one allowed to defeat you.

Saying this is forbidden by rule 117 on the evil overlord list, and performing the action commonly associated with it is prohibited by rule 39. Villains who wish their evil plan to succeed are well advised to follow both rules.

More formally, you have combat by champion.
