The Hermit Guru lives on a mountain, in an ancient temple, or anyplace suitably remote. The guru is usually a male, but even the wise witch that lives in a cave could qualify.

Very often, he is an old master and/or has enlightenment superpowers.

The guru could be crazy in a comedy or parody.

It's a discredited trope, and is rarely used without parody outside of the kung-fu spectacular. But it has enough cred from ancient legend that it will make its comeback sooner or later.

Compare reclusive artist. Sub-trope of the hermit.
