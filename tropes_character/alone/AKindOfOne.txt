Some mythological creatures are more famous than others, but a few are so famous that their entire species has been named after them in the popular consciousness, in a kind of mythological malapropism â€” or, alternatively, a singular creature proposed as a unique aberration is adopted by other stories as if it were a species.

Related but distinct from single specimen species, since the original creature may have less-famous forgotten relatives, or the original creature might have been solitary and then turned into a race by later authors. Either way, there's not just one anymore.

However, A Kind Of One may be portrayed as a single specimen species in each subsequent work, following the original; in which case it may be a case of call a smeerp a "rabbit" since the characters have never seen it before, but the readers have. For instance, someone encountering a creature for the first time may call a pegasus a "hippogriff".

Contrast the inversion, a dog named dog, where a character is named after their species instead of vice versa.

Trope name is a reversal of "one of a kind".
