When a will they or won't they?-type couple is on the verge of upgrading their relationship, their friends will quickly vacate the area to give them some privacy. To justify doing so they may hurriedly cook up some implausible reason to leave. The less genre savvy friends may have to be shooed or pulled away, as may children. In some variations, the friends will spy on the couple to see how it goes. In others, the "couple" uses this trope to get others to leave, often by fake-out make-out.

If the friends are jerks, they might say this very loudly so that the couple in question can hear. Resulting in much blushing, and possibly a snap back, as they cannot spit it out once they know they have an audience. This sort of thing is a typical moment killer.

The aggressive behavior is get a room!.
