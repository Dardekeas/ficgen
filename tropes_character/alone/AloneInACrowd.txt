Something has happened to the hero. A shocking revelation, new information brought to light, revealing his best friend is a traitor or that nothing he did changed anything or maybe he can finally see the world the way it is. Or perhaps it's something even simpler, perhaps he just simply loses his idealism and plunges into a contemplation of existential meaninglessness. He doesn't go into a heroic bsod, he just simply stands there, as a crowd of people moves around him (sometimes in fast-forward, even further isolating him). He's simply alone in a crowd. Sometimes known as "calm in a chaotic world" if the crowd moves in fast-forward.

Compare heroic bsod and freak out. See also friendless background. Contrast alone among the couples.
