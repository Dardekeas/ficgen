Bob has infiltrated emperor evulz's side or is possibly undergoing a heel-face turn or similar alliance-shifting move. Alice happens to be a prisoner of Evulz. Bob must somehow convey to Alice that he's there, or that he's changed sides, or some other information. However, he can't just go talk to her, because the guards would get suspicious.

Therefore, he makes the guards believe that he wants a few minutes alone with the prisoner, perhaps she needs to be "interrogated". The guards let him into Alice's cell and leave them to it, chortling at the evilness of their buddy's intentions.

Once Bob manages to convince Alice that he was trying to fool the guards (though maybe only after recovering from a vase to the head she was going to use on the real guard to try to escape), he can finally get that information to her, possibly even help her escape somehow.

If the audience has been unaware of Bob's alignment up to that point, this can be the way the reverse mole is revealed. It's also highly likely that Bob/Bridget has been putting in place the infiltration or acted as the fake defector.

not to be confused with the similar, but entirely distinct, trojan prisoner Ploy. That's when the heroes try to infiltrate a compound by pretending to be a prisoner.

Compare merciful minion.
