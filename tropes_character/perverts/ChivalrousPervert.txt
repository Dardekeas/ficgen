He can't stop ogling the ladies. But unlike some who ogle the ladies, he actually cares about them as people. Woe betide anyone who wrongs women, for he's watching you like a hawk â€” when he's not watching them, that is. Undoubtedly the best type of pervert. Always a good guy, and just to reaffirm that he's a good guy, they'll occasionally give him a rival in the form of an actually dangerous pervert who would go through the boundaries that the Chivalrous one would never consider crossing.

Such a serious Chivalrous Pervert is very likely to also be a male ethical slut with a benevolent for happiness morality. However, it could also be that some part of him might also believe that sex is evil and make him feel guilty about his "immoral" horniness and overcompensate for it by being extra nice. Or his hypersexuality could be an outlet for more complex personal issues, often making him the woobie.

Master Characters describes a similar type under the name Dionysus: a male character who embraces life and brings that love for life to all the women he meets, shaking up their worlds. His influence helps them to move past mourning an old relationship or break free of a current negative relationship. Yet (so says the book) he prefers the company of women in part because he is not at home in the world of men. (This is not always the case.)

Compare handsome lech, whose morals are a bit more loose but not as much as the villainous perv; covert pervert, who is also sympathetic but in no way vocal about his/her... tastes; and lovable sex maniac, who fulfills the latter half of this page's title but most certainly not the former and tends to go for the rule of funny. A chivalrous pervert who prefers to spy on those of his preferred gender may be the peeping tom. Also compare his distaff counterpart, the good bad girl. May end up setting a girl to pervert revenge mode or even an unprovoked pervert payback.
