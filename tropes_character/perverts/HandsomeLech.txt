A casanova wannabe with the added bonus of being attractive. Unfortunately, this may not apply to the rest of their personality.

The Handsome Lech is a skirt chaser even if his shameless flirting is playful and kind of charming. When the more negative parts of their personality become obvious (fear of commitment, irresponsibility, etc.) this will drive away potential suitors. Everyone else will merely not take him seriously because he's a good guy at heart.

These are almost guaranteed to have luck with the one character (who is attracted to him, if only in a slap-slap-kiss way) willing to put up with these problems. If not, then failure is the only option.

This may be the quirk of a bunny-ears lawyer. Compare chivalrous pervert, with which this may overlap.
