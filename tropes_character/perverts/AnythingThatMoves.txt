This character has nonexistent or remarkably low standards within the borders of their species and orientation's NORMAL sexual interest pool. They can be hetero, gay, or bi. This trope doesn't mean they're willing to lay children, animals, or inanimate objects; it means that things like age, personality and attractiveness restrict them much less than the average person. Such a character may get around a lot, but not necessarily; sometimes, it's just that their standards are low.

Note: Do not add behavior patterns that don't fall under rule of funny. Do not add characters for chasing after aliens or fantastic beings. Don't add characters who don't otherwise fit for just using the phrase "Anything That Moves." Anything That Moves is Further Note: If the character would sleep with something outside their species, they probably fall under extreme omnisexual, not this.

Not to be confused with shoot everything that moves â€” though with some people, you never know. The male version is almost always a kavorka man or casanova wannabe; the female version formidable enough to be off-putting to the less experienced members of the cast, except in anime. Then she's a lovable sex maniac.
