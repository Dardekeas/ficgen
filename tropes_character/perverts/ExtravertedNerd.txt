The Extraverted Nerd is a young teenage nerd (almost always male), who dresses and behaves very awkwardly. Unlike nerds in real life (or nerds who star in their shows) he is completely oblivious to his nerdly nature, and is a casanova wannabe who goes after girls without any fear of rejection. In fact, he doesn't take "no" for an answer. Usually serves as the stooge to the main character.

Many nerd characters in shows with laugh tracks are like this. The tv genius is a less annoying example. Although, whether or not an Extraverted Nerd actually has high intelligence is optional.

Often combined with the tv genius, and usually a victim of hollywood dress code. Contrast with hollywood nerd. Compare small name, big ego.
