This woman is a rapist, torturer, or domestic abuser. Her abusiveness makes her sexy, just like her male counterpart. Like him, she is based on the rule of sexy.

She is more likely than her male counterpart to be a temporary sexual encounter rather than a long-term girlfriend. And while the victim of a bastard boyfriend tends to come across as a lovable woobie or sexy love martyr, some stories with a Bastard Girlfriend make her victims come across as deserving whatever they get, or that sexual acts done by females don't really count. There's also sometimes a naive attitude that such a thing can never happen for real anyway.

Abusively sexy women often come off as one of three character types that are distinct but too specific to have pages of their own:

 An  An  An In any variation, she may be a manipulative bitch. If she gets called out on her actions, don't be surprised if she pulls a wounded gazelle gambit to get "rescued" from her victim.

One type of romanticized abuse, and thus a subtrope of fanservice: sexual abuse not designed to be sexy and appealing is not this trope.

Also, it's not a matter of personal preference: when adding or editing examples that you personally don't consider sexy, please abstain from snarky comments about the authors/actors.

In many cases, also a subtrope of double standard: abuse, female on male. Compare and contrast casual kink as well as safe, sane and consensual, for characters who live out BDSM fantasies and show the kind of ethical restraint needed in real life. Fictional characters who do not show such restraint are usually not intended to send a message that bondage is bad.

Also compare to dominatrix, who keeps the "abuse" strictly consensual and in the bedroom. Contrast domestic abuser and unsexy sadist. Strongly related to all women are doms all men are subs. May involve a henpecked husband, particularly in the awful wedded life dom com subgenre.
