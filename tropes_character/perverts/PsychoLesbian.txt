For years, an unfortunate cocktail of censorship and bigotry rendered all lesbian characters on screen exclusively psychotic and villainous. the hays code-era requirements that "deviant" characters (and that included all gay characters of either gender) must not be made sympathetic or rewarded meant that such characters would almost inevitably be toast before the final credits rolled - and this convention has persisted long after the demise of the Code itself.

This trope can sometimes carry uncomfortable subtext: go straight or go crazy. Or at least have the decency of being bisexual so you can be of proper use for men.The Psycho Lesbian will often be a villainess for a hide your lesbians couple; two women who care for each other but don't actually say it out loud.

See depraved homosexual for the male equivalent. See heteronormative crusader for when another character considers a lesbian to be psycho simply for being lesbian. See also love makes you evil, love makes you crazy, and yandere for more general tropes that are closely related.
