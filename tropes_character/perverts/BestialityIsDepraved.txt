Want to mark a character as a sexual deviant, but don't want to run into the unfortunate implications that tropes like the depraved homosexual or bisexual or the psycho lesbian have? Simple. Imply that they have a sexual interest in animals. Preferably farm animals, since common pets still might be a bit too squicky for some.

This is almost always played for laughs, rather than titillation. It works partly because actual bestiality is rare enough to seem less "real" than other acts considered perverted, similar to the unreality of cartoon violence Â— yet common enough that it's more plausible (and perhaps less gross?) than necrophilia. We don't normally worry about the animal, because of said unreality and our moral distance from animals. Since the animals in question are not anthropomorphized and are usually the more "comical" ones found in nature (goats, sheep, chickens). Also, there are not (yet?) "Bestiality Pride" parades of the type that would inspire letter writing campaigns against the trope's use.

You may get a couple of letters from peta and a severe hoof-to-the-head concussion, but frankly you should just expect that going in.For some reason, the welsh appear to be the most acceptable target for this trope, especially concerning sheep. The same also commonly applies to people from Dumfries and Aberdeen among the British. Also, Australians and New Zealanders seem to be fond of accusing each other of excessive fondness for said animal. Latin Americans get this a lot too, especially with regards to donkeys. Sometimes also alleged toward Bedouins and other groups who have long nights alone in the desert with no company except goats and camels. The American version is usually aimed at rednecks, while in Russia, the usual targets of the trope are Caucasians.

For the trope where people remember something naughty the character did and nothing else about the character who did it, see never live it down.

Compare extreme omnisexual. A subtrope of unequal pairing. May result in an interspecies romance.

Bestiality is also known as Zoophilia or Zoosexuality, and the furry fandom do look down upon it, just so you know.
