The distaff counterpart to the dirty old man. Notable, while the male version will engage in groping and similar behavior, this is fairly uncommon for the female version (although the occasional swat or pinch on the bottom is not out of the question), who will often make double entendre-laden references to an "adventurous" past. In some cases, such a character will be played by a guy in drag. A popular characterisation of a brothel's madame.

This character is almost always played for laughs, often as an abhorrent admirer of some sort. When they show up in a darker and edgier show, which is rare, they're often used to show the unfortunate fate of women who let their sex drives lead their lives or, inversely, the result of too much prudishness.

Compare with mrs. robinson who is younger, prettier and still sexually active and doesn't have much problem seducing a younger guy.
