The maneater, the woman whose husbands/love interests keep on dying.

Usually, a Black Widow is a cross between a con artist and a serial killer, a woman who seduces, marries, and then murders men for their money, always using a different name and identity each time to keep the police and her intended victims from twigging to her real identity. She's very much a highly successful vamp.

Black Widows' methods may vary, but poisoning is often favored: it doesn't demand superior strength or leave obvious marks, and it's traditional for wives to do the cooking for their husbands.

There are too many truth in television instances to count.

Occasionally there are more nefarious reasons.

The name "black widow" comes from the official FBI designation for this kind of killer and from the black widow spider, which is so named because of the occasional habit of female black widow spiders (particularly the Australian redback spiders and the southern black widows) to devour their mates after mating. For this reason the trope may be paired with arachnid appearance and attire to really drive the spider metaphor home.

A sub-trope of gold digger (this one prefers to kill her meal ticket instead of living with him).

A sister trope to the bluebeard (the spear counterpart).

Compare yandere, comforting the widow, widow woman (for other widow tropes), will and inheritance tropes. When a pregnancy is involved, this intersects with conceive and kill.

Not to be confused with out with a bang or any of the many characters named "The Black Widow", including the comic book character or female Chechen suicide bombers.
