The best way to survive, nay, thrive during torture is to get off on it (we mean the victim, not the audience).

Whether it's masochism, an iron body or mind, nothing is more demoralizing to a torturer than his victim berating him on a sloppy job, or worse, giving him tips!Even bluffing enjoyment can work wonders when under torture, and we mean the good stuff, not just talkies.

If one really wants to take it up to eleven, remember, it's a good thing you can heal. One way to bypass this resistance to torture is use forced to watch... unless that victim likes the torture as well.

Compare too spicy for yog sothoth, aren't you going to ravish me?, deliberately distressed damsel, combat sadomasochist, unishment and, not least threat backfire. To torture victims who enjoy all sensations, try making them go mad from the isolation.

A form of attack backfire.
