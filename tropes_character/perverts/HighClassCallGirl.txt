She charges Â£600 (or $1,000) an hour, looks great in a court wig and robes, speaks several languages, knows her claret from her Beaujolais, and can carry on a conversation with anyone from the flower vendor to the Queen.

She's not a barrister, or a solicitor, she's a prostitute. More accurately, an escort.

Mind you, she might be arguing cases before a court of law in a few years yet; she could well be putting herself through law school. But for the moment, she is a prostitute. Far likelier than other kinds of prostitutes to be an ethical slut, and to engage in unproblematic prostitution, she might not even charge for sex. Instead she charges only for her company; whether or not sex happens is up to her.

The High Class Call Girl is the highest class of prostitute and one that is usually safer, pays more and is seen as more glamorous. It allows for highly attractive actresses to look convincing as prostitutes and do plenty of fanservice, while not raising too many of the more worrying aspects of prostitution. Her clientele will mostly be men in the upper echelons of society; expect at least one of them to be a politician, particularly one who is always publicly stressing good old fashioned conservative family values. Having said that, if these girls are anything like their real-life counterparts, they cater to a higher-class clientele because they are classy, well-educated, and smart. The nature of this clientele may also lead to them becoming involved in a hookers and blow situation.

Compare and contrast dominatrix and silk hiding steel. Compare gold digger. If they limit themselves to one client, they are the mistress.
