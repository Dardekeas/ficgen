How do you get something you want from another person? Logical arguments, bribery, force, or — if you're a woman trying to persuade a man — the mere fact of having mammary glands.

Yes, because writers think all men are perverts, women don't even need to pretend that getting sex is a likelihood or even a possibility. All they have to do is possess secondary sexual characteristics to get men to do their bidding. We mean, they're men, they can't help it, right?

Can be truth in television, though of course in fiction it's often exaggerated. Compare the lysistrata gambit, which differs in that the characters are in a relationship and that sex is on the table, but still shares the underlying assumption about men's self control. See also distracted by the sexy, which is perhaps an unintended side effect, and screw the rules, i'm beautiful!, for when it isn't necessary for a woman to have a couple of good reasons to do so. See ignore the fanservice for one way this gambit falls flat on its face. Another is for the woman to attempt this on a man by opening their shirt/showing "the goods," only to then find out that the man they're trying it on is gay.

Compare glamour, where the effect is universal, and favors for the sexy, the voluntary, almost always male, response. Compare and contrast with the infamous honey trap, which is more subtly exploitative and usually far more sinister. Not surprisingly this crosses over with marshmallow hell on occasions. sexposition is when the writers use this trope to get the audience to pay attention to plot exposition.
