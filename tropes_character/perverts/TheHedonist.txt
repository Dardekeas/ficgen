This character is strongly motivated by a desire to be happy and experience various kinds of pleasure. Unlike an ethical hedonist, however, the character isn't mature enough to sufficiently consider even his own long-term needs, much less the (short-term or long-term) needs of others. Personal instant gratification is the goal here. Sometimes flanderized so that the pursuit of pleasure becomes the characters only defining trait, doing whatever feels good without any thought of the consequences. "I Did It for the lulz" might just as well be his motto.

Such a childish mentality is often justified by the character actually being a child. If the character is adult, he might be a sex maniac lovable or otherwise.

While usually played for laughs, this kind of character is sometimes played as a strawman political against ethical hedonists or people with a hedonistic lifestyle. Unlike these real hedonists, a childishly hedonistic character is not prone to consider other peoples happiness, or even his own long-term happiness: Instant gratification is gold. If it feels good right now, do it! Why waste time on thinking? Thinking isnt fun! unless you are thinking about how to get what you want as quickly and effortlessly as possible, that is.

It's original to compare this general viewpoint to the original hedonists, who believed you should basically do the opposite; true happiness is the opposite of desires, which cause pain. So you shouldn't do anything you really want. You can imagine any of the characters on this page laughing ruthlessly at the idea.

Compare it amused me and protagonist-centered morality (for this trope played sympathetically). for happiness is another related trope.
