An individual — almost always a pervert of some kind — who steals and collects women's (or girls') underwear, usually worn/used. Almost always presented as a reprehensible individual and usually an enemy of the hero, and just as frequently played for laughs. They can be divided into the stalker with a crush who steals a specific person's underwear as part of a general stalking campaign, and the indiscriminate, compulsive underwear thief who usually doesn't engage in more serious sexual offenses and is more likely to be treated as a comic figure. One might call such a character a knicker nicker.

Panty Thieves usually go about their business while wearing stealth clothes.

Usually this is an anime trope, but Western culture has independently produced the college prank of panty raiding (which has been out of fashion since the sexual revolution of the sixties). Panty raids are usually perpetrated by groups of perverted young males, rather than just one guy.
