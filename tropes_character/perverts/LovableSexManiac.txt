The ethics of TV-land are fluid and lackadaisical, and nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the Lovable Sex Maniac. This form of the casanova goes above and beyond the average sleaze, engaging in the full spectrum of perversion — from dabbling in pornography to blatant sexual advances to outright molestation, sometimes of severely underaged characters. In the real world, of course, such behavior will land you in hot water — but on TV, the worst you'll get is a whack from a hyperspace mallet. The only thing that keeps the Lovable Sex Maniac from being a truly disturbing anti-hero is that his antics are always played for laughs — and the odd thing is, it usually works.

A hard-drinking party girl can double as the Lovable Sex Maniac with, interestingly, very little change just because she's female, especially if the lack of men forces her to chase after women. Compare the chivalrous pervert. Contrast handsome lech.

Compare to the extreme omnisexual, who is willing to sleep with anything, but might not have sex on the brain all the time.
