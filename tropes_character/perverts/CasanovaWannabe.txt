He wants to be the casanova, but he fails horribly. Maybe it's the polyester suit. Or the gold medallion around his neck. Or the phony "hey babe". Or the obvious hair plugs. Whatever it is, though, the girls see it from a mile away and give him a wide berth.

Sometimes the Casanova Wannabe talks a great game. He may have all his friends convinced that he's the original ladies' man and that his bed is never cold. But the truth is, he still hasn't done it (or, if not, has only had bought-and-paid-for sex. Once. Which will be revealed in a pathetic and embarrassing tearful and/or drunken confession). The women can see the blinking neon "loser" sign bolted to his receding hairline a mile away. He clearly wants to prove his manhood, via sex as rite-of-passage, but hasn't managed it yet. If he has a job, it's likely as a lounge lizard.

Generally he's bound to succeed once or twice, by law of averages if nothing else. These relationships usually don't last long.

Compare nerds are virgins and extraverted nerd. Contrast kavorka man, even the guys want him. For a female version, see abhorrent admirer.
