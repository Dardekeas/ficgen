The Peeping Tom is a character who gets his kicks from non-consensual voyeurism â€” spying on others in explicit situations without their permission or knowledge. Peeping Toms are often driven by a fetishistic urge, deriving pleasure not just from the act of spying itself, but from the thrill of the potential for getting caught. This is, unfortunately, a case of truth in television, as acts of peeping are reported in all cultures around the world, their goal made easier each year as technology marches on.

The methods of peeping can vary from work to work, from the classic depiction of a pervert peering through windows to watch people changing clothes, to naughty birdwatching through the use of telescopes or binoculars, to the tech-savvy voyeur who sets up hidden cameras in bathroom stalls. While these characters are commonly male, a female Peeping Tom (or "Peeping Tammy", if you will) is plausible. Characters who focus their attention on only the subject of their unrequited affection may be both The Peeping Tom and a stalker with a crush.

In more dramatic stories, it is rare for a Peeping Tom character to be shown in a sympathetic light. In works where this trope is played for laughs, however, a chivalrous pervert may show some Peeping Tom tendencies.

A subtrope of girl watching. Sometimes overlaps with outdoor bath peeping in cases where the spying is intentional. An innocent character who is wrongfully accused of being a Peeping Tom is instead an accidental pervert.
