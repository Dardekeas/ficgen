The sexual predator — a man who relentlessly pursues, lands, loves, and then abandons members of the opposite sex, a skill bestowed upon him to demonstrate what a badass he is. Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, this character leaves behind a string of broken hearts, and occasional vows of revenge that are rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation is indulging his lust and desire, sating them with the bodies of his conquests.

Due to gender double standards, the Casanova is always male, given that women are usually shamed for having an active sex life. The comparatively rarer female version is traditionally called a "man-eater", but shell likely be portrayed as an evil character who exploits her sexuality to manipulate innocent men. The womanizing skills of the Casanova, on the other hand, will almost always be granted to him to make him look like a champion. This trope also applies almost exclusively to straight men, given that queer people with an active sex life are usually villainized in media. Meanwhile, straight men get to be portrayed as badasses for having multiple women at their beck and call.the casanova is also usually white, with men of color are commonly depicted as perverts when they give in to their sexual desires, and white male casanovas being with women of colour generally getting portrayed as fine.

Contrast with the unsuccessful casanova wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable kavorka man. A guy who gets the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, is a chick magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with chivalrous pervert. the charmer is equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If they really get around but want to settle down, it's looking for love in all the wrong places. A handsome lech has more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova.

The trope is named for Giacomo Girolamo Casanova (1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography (in which he almost literally described himself as God's Gift to Women) established his eternal fame as a lover. It should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a chivalrous pervert who really was looking for love... just with women who were locked in loveless political marriages — and also gained his successes famously ugly. (Definitely he was no Heath Ledger.) Interesting and prone to be noted for his modern wannabes, he was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from his partners.

Many films, TV movies and TV mini-series are named for and based on that person. The best known are Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starring heath ledger, and the 2005 bbc drama mini-series starring david tennant. The latter is considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't.

For the juvenile version — all of the above without the sex — see kidanova. Contrast the serial romeo. If the guy is actually only rumored to be a Casanova and has no evidence onscreen, it's the urban legend love life. If he develops feelings for one of his conquests (or someone who refuses him), he's a ladykiller in love. See more friends, more benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the player character to act this way.

Note: It should be mentioned that even after the affairs were over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked him, and he was reputedly quite the gentleman. This trope would probably fit (the fictional) Don Juan better.
