A holy man, or a man pretending to be one, who, despite being ostensibly above such worldly desires, is one of the most perverted members of the cast, far more lecherous than any layperson. He's constantly eyeing up and making passes at girls, and often has a sizable stash of skin mags or other pornography.

The depiction of such characters varies widely between Western and Eastern works; while manga and anime will often play it for laughs with Buddhist (or pseudo-buddhist) monk/priest characters, Western works will usually portray such characters as depraved, hypocritical, and often outright predatory (cf. pedophile priest).

This is quite an old trope; in Europe, at least, the depravity, greed, and gluttony of monks have been a common theme of both angry screeds and popular jokes and comic literature going back to the middle ages.

Subtrope of nun too holy. May overlap with sexy priest, in which case it's the spear counterpart to naughty nuns.
