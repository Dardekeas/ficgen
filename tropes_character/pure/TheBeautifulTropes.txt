Tropes that are all about things that are beautiful, or at least beautiful to look at. If you see one of these tropes, it largely involves being as pleasing to the eye as possible.

Or pleasing in the beautiful sense, since some might find stuff blowing up appealing to look at, but that's rule of cool.

Sure beauty might be only skin deep, but as always, tropes are not bad.

See also attraction tropes, garnishing the story.
