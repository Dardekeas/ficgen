Some things are just too good to let everybody get their hands on; they might be too rare, too dangerous or maybe just too evil to start dishing out all willy nilly. However people with pure hearts will have the chance to access things restricted to only the pure of heart such as:

 The ability to wield certain weapons or other magical items.

 The power to cast certain spells.

 Immunity to certain enchantments or dark powers.

  The ability to harm Note that it is extremely difficult both to attain and maintain: Just as virgin power requires that you can't have sex, ever, any small stumbling will destroy your powers, too (even if it is in mind only).

Occasionally pure is not good and the pure evil characters pass mustard as well.

It may be a naive wide-eyed idealist, which makes him/her easily exploitable by the bad guys.

Subtrope of phlebotinum-handling requirements. Compare only the knowledgable may pass, only smart people may pass, only the worthy may pass, children are innocent.
