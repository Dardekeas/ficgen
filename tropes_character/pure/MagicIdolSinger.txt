A sub-trope of magical girl where her magical identity is an idol singer. They come in two varieties - either a girl who is already an idol singer gains the ability to fight crime, usually by way of singing, or a girl who becomes an idol singer through the use of magic.

This type of magical girl is the one that uses the wish fulfillment appeal of the genre the most. While the other two types uses her powers to do good deeds or fight the good fight, the Magical Girls here use the powers they gain to achieve their dreams of stardom, although they can use magic music.

As the protagonists here tend to be too young to be part of the musical industry, older alter ego is often used.

Note the character has to be a magical girl, not just someone with music related powers.
