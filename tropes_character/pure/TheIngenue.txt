A young actress in a theatre troupe is often called an ingenue, as she is frequently cast in this role. Expect the white-dwarf starlet to wax poetic on how she was The Ingenue once.

If an Ingenue grows up it's likely she will become silk hiding steel.

There is no direct spear counterpart to the Ingenue that shares the same characteristics and positive connotations.
