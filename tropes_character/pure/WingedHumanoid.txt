Simply put, it's a human with wings sprouting from their back.

Biologically improbable due to human bone and muscle structure (though at the same time, usually easy to rationalize due to the at-a-glance nature of our shoulders), and if they're intended for actual flight, you may have to write off several laws of physics as well. Therefore, such characters are often assumed to be not entirely of this world. This ties into the classic depictions of winged angels as well.

The type of wing is usually indicative of the character's morality â€” see good wings, evil wings.

If there's something even slightly resembling feathers, expect a perpetual molt. Don't expect flapping, however there will be plenty of floating.

Best done via animation, as live-action wings are bulky and can look rather silly. Animated wings are also easier to "tuck away", or may even vanish into hammerspace. If a character suddenly sprouts a pair, it's because power gives you wings.

Generally seen as highly attractive, even if the wings do nothing. If you're looking for the flying partner of an ace pilot, try wing man.

Subtrope of monstrous humanoid. See also draconic humanoid, who may have dragon wings but looks decidedly less human. Compare peacock girl, pegasus. May become a broken angel if their wings are clipped.
