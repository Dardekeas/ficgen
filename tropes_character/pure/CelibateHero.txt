Someone who doesn't do the romance thing. Unlike the clueless chaste hero, who just doesn't get romance, the Celibate Hero consciously and actively shuns and avoids it. He/She turns away every potential girl of the week and shuts out the pleas of his/her official love interest.

naturally this results in far more opportunities for romantic encounters (particularly the vamp) than if they were looking for them. This is not to say that the Celibate Hero is unable to be affected by the force of a dulcinea effect, only that he or she either is acting on a higher ideal (chivalry) or resists its power later on.

There are a variety of potential motives for this behavior: belief that it's a distraction, a weakness, something they would like but don't have time for, etc. See the Analysis page for details.

Expect more than one reason to come into play, usually reinforcing one another; rarely do any of these show up alone.

Often a type of heroic vow.

Compare asexuality, old-fashioned rowboat date, courtly love, did not get the girl, no hugging, no kissing.

Contrast loved i not honor more.
