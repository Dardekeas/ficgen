The White Magician Girl is a stock character appearing in fantasy Literature and role playing games, acting as the party's resident healer, nurturer and source of feminine wisdom. While the other party members are slaughtering opponents, the White Magician Girl is taking care of their wounds with gentleness and compassion, and congratulating them after the battle with her brilliant smile. She is often included as a female protagonist because guys smash, girls shoot or as a foil to a less traditionally feminine action girl. She's basically the white mage infused with incorruptible pure pureness.

There are three essential elements of the White Magician Girl:

   While not a requirement, she is frequently the love interest of the hero, and will generally overlap with traditionally feminine fantasy archetypes such as the rebellious princess or mystical waif. It's not uncommon for them to be princesses (rebellious or not), pacifists, or clergy. Characters of this archetype are frequently paired with a black mage, usually a black magician girl or lady of black magic, as a foil.

See also the medic, white mage, the heart, and the chick. This trope is almost the inverse of the black magician girl.
