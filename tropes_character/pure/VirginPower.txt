So you've got your hands on a spiffy, brand new bunch of applied phlebotinum. It will do anything. Launch psychic fireballs, generate matter out of nothing, lay waste to entire towns, fulfill your fondest desires, and let your cat out every evening before bedtime.There's only one catch: the person using it has to be that rarest of all rarities in a normal, functioning, sex-obsessed adult society.

A virgin.

And by virgin, we almost always mean a female virgin. Because male virgins don't exist. ever. Often, being with another woman "doesn't count."And by female virgin, we generally mean a sweet, young (but adult), beautiful, innocent, wholesome virgin. The action girl is treated as something of a subversion, as is an actual prepubescent child, and the sour-tempered and ancient old maid is always played as if it were a subversion.

And just why would someone need to be a virgin to have access to a special power? Most likely because being a virgin is a generally recognized sign of moral purity. Greater moral purity = greater access to God = exclusive access to his power. This is why most Virgin Power tends to be TheurgyÂ—magic which is tied to certain gods or goddesses. (See functional magic for more details.) Sometimes this ideal of purity can be subverted by having the virgin user of the applied phlebotinum be morally reprehensible in every other aspect of her life. (Which makes one wonder just how accurate virginity can be as a measuring stick for moral character.)

If the user of the Virgin Power is the hero's girlfriend, you can expect this situation to create a lot of dramatic tension between the lovers, as they fight the temptation to do the one thing which will render her powers useless. Also, you can expect the villains to try to "relieve" the user of her virginity via rape (even when just killing her from a distance would be the safer and faster option).

eunuchs are evil can be a villainous version, if such a character has special powers that come with the position, although most eunuchs are not celibate by choice. Contrast deus sex machina. Beware virgin sacrifice. Tends to cause virgin tension. And in some cases nature abhors a virgin. A sub-trope of conditional powers. virgin vision is not related to this trope, regardless of how it sounds.
