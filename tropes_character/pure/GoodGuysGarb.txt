Tropes about the clothing worn by good guys in fiction, whether pure of heart heroes or anti heroes, and whether protagonists or innocent bystanders.

Not that villains or neutral characters never wear some of these outfits, but the majority of examples are worn by those on the side of good.

Compare hollywood dress code.
