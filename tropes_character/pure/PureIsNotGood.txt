Okay, so you've been told that in order to make the Phlebotinum work, or go to this particular place, or what have you, you have to be pure of heart. And then you get there, and there's the big bad. What?!? Turns out Pure Is Not Good.

In fact, it's perfectly possible to be Pure Evil.

In japanese media, this trope is likely rooted in the philosophical concept of "makoto", which loosely means "pure heart". It basically means a mind free of distractions, unnecessary thoughts, doubts, or fallacies and is mostly used in context of hard work, loyalty and determination. Makoto, while considered a "good" thing, is not limited to good intentions. For example, a villain that shows complete, fanatical dedication to their cause would be demonstrating "makoto". His dedication is "pure"; his goals, not so much.

This trope is solely for "pure of heart" where purity does not necessarily denote goodness. Any resemblance to being a trope about pure substances is... ahem... purely coincidental.

May make use of virgin power as a specific form of purity. See also ambiguous innocence, light is not good, straight edge evil.

Contrast incorruptible pure pureness.
