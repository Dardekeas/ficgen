Describing a character as being fond of, or having a soft spot for, children is an automatic pet the dog since children are innocent with bonus points if the kids like the character back. Characters who don't like kids are usually villains or anti-heroic. Note that this trope doesn't apply if it is a disguise put on to avoid suspicion for something else entirely...This is mainly a trait of the gentle giant, the emotional bruiser, all-loving hero, and a requirement for purity personified unless pure is not good is in play, and a redeeming trait for many antiheroes. Overlaps with wouldn't hurt a child, as characters who fit this trope not only are reluctant to injure children, but would go out of their way to protect children if it was necessary.

God help you if you're dumb enough to harm a child in the presence of someone with this character trait. they do not like that at all (then again this trope is a trait of Jesus [see right], and by extension God Himself, so you may not get that help).

This is older than feudalism as seen in the page image. Compare friend to all living things and big brother instinct, and contrast child hater.
