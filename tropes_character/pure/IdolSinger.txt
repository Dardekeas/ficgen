A wildly popular trope in japanese pop music is the "Idol Singer" â€” a teenage or early twenty-something (never over 25) female performer, chosen for her cute and attractive image and sunny personality more than for her actual singing ability. Idol Singers are recruited by multi-level audition processes, manufactured and managed by Japanese media companies, and ruthlessly discarded after a few years of cranking out formulaic hits. Sometimes, idol singers don't actually sing (like Milli Vanilli). Originally they were supposed to be pure and innocent, and her contract could well include an article of her not being allowed to have a boyfriend. However, after the 80s this trend has withered, and more modern idols are likely to be seen in cheesecake, or even raunchier photos.

Naturally, every Japanese schoolgirl dreams of becoming one. Those who used to be one are often broken birds.

Thanks to the disney channel, American Idol, and The X Factor, this trope is also prevalent in the West, where it often overlaps with the teen idol.

If she's a villain in a superhero or magic idol singer show, she's an evil diva. Do not confuse with the singer billy idol.
