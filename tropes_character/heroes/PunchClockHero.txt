The Punch Clock Hero isn't fighting for peace, revenge, or because it's the right thing to do. He's only going against the big bad because he has to. In some cases, he is destined to do so but refused the call, only to find out that you can't fight fate. In other cases, he gets involved only because he has bills to pay.

This is usually what happens when a hero is true neutral. Compare heroic neutral, where the heroic character wants to be left alone and only allies with a group (usually the heroes) when their isolation is threatened by an outside source. If the culture becomes toxic, the heroic character can become a punch clock villain.

only in it for the money is a subtrope, as is not in this for your revolution.

May overlap with i was just passing through.
