The Henshin Hero is a variation or subtrope of the super hero in which super-powered characters only have their special powers some of the time. A Henshin Hero has distinct normal and powered "forms," and needs to actively switch between the two. In essence, the character's powers are all turned off while he or she is in their secret identity.

Henshin Heroes often have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase, triggering a transformation sequence.

The transformation is frequently accompanied by a costume change. This gives the trope some overlap with clothes make the superman: many male Henshin Heroes wear power-armor of some kind, and their transformation allows them to don their armor almost instantly. Bonus points if the change of clothing is the only outward difference, but nobody notices.

The name comes from the Japanese term for the trope, henshin (literally meaning "change body" but more practically translated as "transformation" or "metamorphosis" ... and not to be confused with the shapeshifting or metamorphosis tropes).

superpowered alter ego is when this trope meets split personality.
