A tool often used by media makers to help make sure you empathize with the party that they want you to empathize with.

The surest way to show that a hero is undeniably a hero and an awesome guy, is to show him hanging out and totally loving his dog. It's his dog. Who ever heard of an awesome dude that doesn't love his dog?

Think of this trope as being the physical manifestation of pet the dog. If a character has a dog which is around him constantly and whom he is always nice, respectful, and loving to, then that means a scene literally cannot go by in which he does not pet the dog. So of course he must be noble and good at heart. Villains who are cruel enough to mess with the dog, on the other hand, can expect full-on retribution from the hero in question.

The dog in question is frequently a canine companion, sometimes also a post-apocalyptic dog. See also evil-detecting dog, for some of the logic behind this.

Contrast right-hand cat and right-hand attack dog, compare kindhearted cat lover.
