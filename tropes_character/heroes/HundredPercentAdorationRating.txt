There are rulers whom everyone hates. There are plain old bad rulers — god save us from the queen!, the royally screwed up, or the caligula. There are useless rulers. Then there are characters such as the high queen, the good king, the wise prince and those who do their job so well they have vetinari job security.

And then there are people with this.

Everyone loves them. They aren't just loyal. They aren't just grateful to have these rulers in charge. They actually care about their rulers on a personal level. A simple request — not an order, but an appeal — will get immediate results. They will be hugely honored when a favor is granted to them. Threatening or insulting their ruler triggers anger. If a ruler is sick or hurt, they'll worry like it's their own family. They follow wherever the rulers lead, but never forget that they're human. These rulers have a Hundred Percent Adoration Rating. They are almost always royals who actually do something and almost always modest royalty.

Contrast 0% approval rating. An adventurer (not a ruler) treated this way has a 100% heroism rating. When the adoration is enforced by others, it's unacceptable targets.

Much like 0% approval rating, this trope is also impossible in real life, as even some of the most admired leaders (and puppies) will have some dissidents who oppose them. It is, however, common in myths, 'official' histories, and propaganda. Claiming a Hundred Percent Approval Rating is common in the people's republic of tyranny.
