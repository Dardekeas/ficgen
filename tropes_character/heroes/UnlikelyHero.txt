What would happen if you replaced a mary sue with a well-written ridiculously average guy without changing the plot? This trope is a character who gets involved in all sorts of craziness in defiance of all reasonable logic. Basically, they can't even take a vacation without becoming the chosen one or saving the world. Whereas to a mary sue, it's all in a day's work, this character often finds all the craziness surrounding them annoying and must rely on the remainder of the cast to keep their life from becoming an even worse disaster than it already is.

Often, the character has little interest in ever becoming a hero and is basically happy being a ridiculously average guy as long as they get a better job / win the contest / get a date with the hottie / etc. Typically, the character is either a kid hero who would rather play video games, or a deadpan snarker who has become slightly jaded and genre savvy after saving the world 12 times last year. Often played for laughs.
