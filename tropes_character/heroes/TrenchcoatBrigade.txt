The most famous spitting image of an occult detective, many creators figure that if they give a bloke a trenchcoat, a pack of smokes, and a five o'clock shadow; a quick wit, hard-boiled and self-referential dialogue and a mysterious and dark past, they've got themselves a magnificent bastard of an antihero that they can send out to fight occult foes.

Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. What they always do get, though, is a member of the Trenchcoat Brigade.

Members of the Trenchcoat Brigade are those characters who are strongly influenced by, inspired by, or out and out expy/copies of the character of john constantine, first introduced in 1985 by dc comics. He has all of the above characteristics, as well as being British, blond, and pretty much a loner. (The strings of loved-and-lost women — or occasionally men — they may take up with don't count.)

For the trenchcoat itself, see badass longcoat, mere possession of which does not automatically make one a member of the trenchcoat brigade. The item of apparel in question is also (and was earlier) a stereotype of "stale beer" spy fiction, which lends plenty of inspiration to the characters on this page. Not as much overlap with trench coat warfare as you might expect.
