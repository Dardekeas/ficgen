There is a niche between the ordinarily powered heroine and the superpowered super girl heroine. She has a little extra somethin' most humans don't, but is nowhere near the cape country.

She is independent and strong willed, but vulnerable. Her little extra somethin' isn't powerful enough that she won't have to use her brains to solve a problem, but she can occasionally call on that somethin' for a solution most people couldn't use.

She is essentially a fantastic expression of "Girl Power", whatever that means for the show's target generation.

See also: magical girl, action girl, cute bruiser. plucky girl is the 'non-superpowered, but gets the job done anyway' version.

not to be confused with a girl with an extraordinary amount of the most common superpower. (Though some examples are pretty busty.)
