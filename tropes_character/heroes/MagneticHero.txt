Occasionally, you get a hero with such personal magnetism that he is capable of persuading others, usually the badass bystander, to join him in his quest. Of course, the new companion has no qualms about killing for, or even dying for, the hero, despite having known him only briefly and facing many people who want him dead.

This is a staple of fiction that may well be older than they think. Many epics and legends chronicle the process by which a hero gathers a band of motley friends and allies of dubious background but doubtless courage and nobility. Even if the hero has no special quality compared to his subordinates, this is often his implied "power", heart.

There's a few variants of this:

  Conversely,    Often at the center of a character magnetic team. Contrast with the dulcinea effect, which usually involves the hero falling victim to a similar phenomenon at the hands of a member of the opposite sex, and hitchhiker heroes. A female magnetic hero who leads male characters with the dulcinea effect may be a jeanne d'arch√©type. On a larger scale, the usual subject of a protagonist shall lead them.

The resultant group generally turns out to be a ragtag bunch of misfits. If it actually sticks around for a while, you may get true companions or badass crew.

Contrast socially-awkward hero.
