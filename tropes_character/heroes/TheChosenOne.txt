The ultimate victim (or beneficiary) of because destiny says so. The oldest and most common super hero origin. The easiest way to turn an ordinary high-school student into the only thing preventing the end of the world as we know it. Take it for granted that they are the only one.

One would think that the title implies some superior intelligent being or force had to make the Choice, but it's not common practice to expect the chooser of the one. Other human beings have a lot of trouble just finding the Chosen One. And don't even get started on when they're wrong...Bonus points if the character is actually called "The Chosen" or "The Chosen One", or the phrase "Only You Can Save X" appears. The title of Chosen One may prove to be largely unnecessary. See also only the chosen may wield for examples of how the Chosen One is often identified. Compare it sucks to be the chosen one and the chosen many. Contrast the unchosen one.

That said, always be wary about what you are being chosen for. If your job description involves "defeating the darkness" and involves long years of danger and struggle, chances are good that you've been made the hero. If, on the other hand, your job description involves getting pampered by half-naked temple virgins, then chances are very good that you've been chosen to be a sacrifice instead!

Not to be confused with giving the sword to a noob, where there is someone clearly more qualified that is able to do the job.
