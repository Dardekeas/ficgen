You're at your fairly mundane job, which isn't anything martial (military, police, security guard, etc), doing your job, when all the sudden there's an explosion, or gunfire, or someone shouting that you're now a hostage. The professional badasses who'd normally kick ass and chew bubblegum, if they weren't out of bubblegum, are not available for whatever reason (slow to respond, killed, corrupted, etc).

So what do you do? Do you hide in a closet or something, and hope the bad guys pass you by or otherwise don't notice you while your friends/coworkers/family possibly face a fate worse than death?

Hell, no! You're a man, not a mouse! (Unless your name is Mickey, and if it is you're unlikely to be in that situation in the first place - but we've got sources that say you'd kick ass if found in it anyway.)

You step up to the plate, and start kicking ass. Sure, you might die in the process, but at least you went down swinging, instead of cowering in fear.Often these characters are either long lost ex-military or scientist working on the latest phlebotinum.

Related to crouching moron, hidden badass, but the character isn't bumbling or otherwise incompetent, they're just not specifically competent or trained in the situation in question. Sometimes can also be a badass bookworm, and most commonly a badass normal. The Right Man is often the only one who can save the day, for whatever reason. If not the protagonist, they may be a badass bystander.

A type of action survivor. On the tv tropes power scale, these usually rate as Muggle Weight or Iron Weight. Compare falling into the cockpit and it began with a twist of fate, and compare/contrast unlikely hero and heroic bystander.
