The resistance is in peril. The forces of evil are knocking on their gate. They have no choice, they must use the dangerous forbidden technique to summon a hero from another world to assist them.

And they get bob smith, from Normal, Arizona! An average kid who just happens to be what they need for the job. The summoners may be unimpressed, or be totally blind that this guy is going to need a lot of training from hell to be useful. Since he IS the chosen one, he will save the day in the end and either choose to stay in the new fantastic world or go home and be normal again at the end of his adventure.

A typical set up for trapped in another world stories. This is a very, very popular trope in regards to getting the everyman from the modern world into the magical land.

Sometimes, rather than an everyman, the spell summons someone who is exactly what's needed for a given situation. If no summoning is involved, he's an action survivor. Other times, the everyman really is very average and probably too squishy to last long enough to make a difference, but they will get summoned INTO the body of someone or something more physically impressive as part of the summoning or just by accident.

Named for the Dungeons & Dragons spell "Summon Monster".
