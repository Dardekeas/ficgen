Usually, in modern stories, a character who's a sexist, racist, or something else of that kind is the bad guy. This is mostly due to the present day view that prejudice is generally bad.

Sometimes, either due to an author on board, values dissonance, deliberate values dissonance, or something else, a character can get away with opinions that are... controversial. If the excuse is well-done, it can work. If not, it seems like a karma houdini. Unless, of course, he is punished for it, or forced to undergo a face-heel turn.

It has become increasingly common for heroes of this type to not only have their political incorrectness lampshaded by the author and by other characters, but to be aware of it themselves. This type of "hero" knows his attitudes are wrong but is too proud to give them up, usually due to honor before reason. He might develop into a noble bigot or troubled sympathetic bigot.

See: bury your gays because it's disturbing how similarly these two often work. Also see good flaws, bad flaws for a more thorough analysis of "discrimination as a flaw".
