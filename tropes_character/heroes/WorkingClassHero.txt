This character tends to be disdainful and negative to characters who learn things through books and/or display conscious and unconscious elitist assumptions about class and society. In other places, for instance communist nations, a Working Class Hero reads books, learns about ideas, and generally isn't anti-intellectual - this character type is more common in socialist and communist literature, which usually works specifically to avert working class people are morons.

Historically, in the vast majority of literature and theater, the heroes and heroines tend to be from aristocratic families while middle-class and working-class family problems are confined to comedies. For a long time, critics and artists regarded aristocratic issues such as fall of a ruling family of high seriousness because it was united with the problems of state as it existed then. Also, realistically speaking, they had better career opportunities to be captains, commanders, soldiers and heroes, so artists should not be faulted for reflecting the confined and restricted worldview as it existed then. In the wake of the revolutions of the 19th and 20th Centuries, when social classes started uplifting themselves, the prevalence of the working-class hero and the artistic modes to represent them gained increasing currency.
