Many fictional worlds show a hero working his way to fight and stop some great evil. Sometimes their princes or knights fighting to save a damsel in distress, maybe they're mercenaries fighting evil for a paycheck? or a regular person relying strictly on his wits and luck? Either way, they were defined as heroes on their respective stories.

But what if being a hero alone is to be considered a job?

Hero Academy refers to a organization, or part of an organization, that trains people to develope the skills and knowledge, usually both (or either) combat-related or otherwise, needed to be able to do heroic deeds, unlike superhero school, it usually trains regular people with little to no superpowers and teaches their students the skills they need rather than picking out students that already have extraordinary abilities, though they may pick out individuals that they believe show potential. A subtrope of extranormal institute: one thing a Hero Academy has in common with superhero school and wizarding school that may separate it from military school or military academy is that they function as a society as much as a training program. Compare adventure guild, which can be a faction that focuses more on having individuals go on quests than on tutoring students how to successfully go through them
