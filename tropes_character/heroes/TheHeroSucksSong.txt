The opposite of the villain sucks song where a song describes how horrible the villain is. This trope is about a song that insults a hero. One way to show how cruel and vile a villain can be is singing a song to demoralize a hero, even so demoralizing that the hero will either suffer a heroic bsod or it may be a way for the hero to unleash his righteous indignation against the villain.This can also include jerkasses and bullying characters singing nasty and hurtful songs to good-natured characters, especially if it happens in high school (expect cheerleaders to engage in songs like this.) The song can involve the villain ranting about the hero always stopping them from taking over the world or complaining about their justice and moral character.

Can overlap with villain song if it's the villain who boasts about being better than the hero. Compare "the reason you suck" speech. May also be sung by neutral characters about a hero with bad publicity.
