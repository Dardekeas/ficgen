Some heroes want redheads. Some heroes are redheads.

Considering that, of all hair colours, red is the least common, it isn't surprising that it is used when writers want someone to stand out, at least in shows that don't give random extras blue and green hair.

One distinction between red-haired heroes and villains is that where heroes tend to have bright-colored hair (almost reddish-blond), villains have darker-colored, almost brownish hair. Red is second only to blonde hair for a hero (see law of chromatic superiority).

Frequently, they'll have a fiery personality to go with their hair.

A sub-trope of red is heroic.
