They fight for the good guys. they might even believe in the cause (to a point). But they are a hero only in name.

They are antiheroes who have a fundamental lack of empathy, a sociopathic disregard for human life. They may be motivated by boredom, or by some sort of carrot-and-stick arrangement - a chip in the head, an attachment to some person or thing that requires them to do good, or a pragmatic code that prevents their truly inhuman nature from landing them in jail.

They may solve their problems in much the same way as a villain wouldâ€”ruthlessly manipulating and killing their way to their goal. They may routinely torture, murder, and/or commit evil acts nearly as bad as the big bad. they'll do whatever it takes to win. The people they fight beside worry about their behavior, but feel "at least they're on our side."

Compare heroic comedic sociopath, for when this kind of behavior is played for laughs and token evil teammate, which he will be if a team player. A Sociopathic hero is generally either a nominal hero or a villain protagonist. If a character is treated as an ideal hero despite being this then this has been combined with a designated hero.

This trope overlaps the sociopathic soldier, especially if the settings is war or a chaotic milieu.

truth in television: sociopathic heroes do exist in real life. More detail is not necessary.
