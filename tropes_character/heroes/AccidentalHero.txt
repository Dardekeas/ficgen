A character becomes celebrated for heroism. Problem is, it isn't false modesty this time. He really didn't do anything special.

Two flavors:

 The accidental hero blundered in some way that actually caused a rescue or saved the day.

 The accidental hero was just standing around in a place where it looked like he saved the day.

In either flavor, public acclaim that just won't go away is the main complication. The subsequent plot is a good showcase for examining the fiber of the accidental hero's character and to spin a little yarn about how people ''need'' heroes.

May be a consequence of non-protagonist resolver. Compare and you thought it was a game, badass on paper, cowardly lion, framed for heroism, god guise, nominal hero, mistaken for badass, spanner in the works and nice job fixing it, villain. May result in broken pedestal.

This trope is the spiritual opposite of nice job breaking it, hero.
