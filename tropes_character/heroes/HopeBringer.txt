We have two sides of a conflict - the empire is opposed by la r√©sistance or just common folks they oppress, the legions of hell fight with church militants, the galactic conqueror is in a war with the federation, the multiversal conqueror fights against the guardian of the multiverse, the scary dogmatic aliens are opposed by the men in black and space marines. And one side has a giant advantage; they win on every front and it's only a matter of time before they utterly annihilate their enemies. This is the darkest hour for the weaker side, but fear not, because hope springs eternal.

Then comes this guy. Hope Bringer is a living proof that one man can make a difference and even the odds. By his actions, he restores hope in the hearts of his allies and leads them into the fight and victory. He can be the big good, the magnificent bastard, the chessmaster, the ace, the rebel leader or the person of mass destruction - whatever makes him so special, it works. He can make the two sides not only fight on equal ground again, but even reverse the situation and make the side he helps repay the other one for everything they did.

His motives may vary. He can help the good guys because he believes in justice, loves his fatherland, wants revenge, tends to his flock, spreads the good news or just because destiny says so. Often he is the chosen one.

Note that this isn't always a good thing, since hope is scary and sometimes leads to a hope spot.

Compare the hero, magnetic hero, supporting leader and all-loving hero. Can be created by summon everyman hero. Contrast with the dreaded, who is defined by how others fear them. The opposite of this trope is hope crusher, who delights on despair and destroying any semblances of hope.
