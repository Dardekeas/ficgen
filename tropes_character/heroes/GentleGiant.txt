He's big, muscular and angry looking. He might even be an actual monster. People are often fearful of him. But he's got a heart of gold. He loves children and puppies, and frequently abhors unnecessary violence. He probably has a few unexpected hobbies. He's the Gentle Giant. However, when push comes to shove, he's great to have on your side in battle.

This is a subversion of common sense that has become an archetype in its own right. We are all used to thinking of big people and giant creatures as frightening and mean. Starting back as far as frankenstein's monster or earlier, the seven-foot shambling hulk of a man is almost always gentle inside, and misunderstood by society at large.

This archetype is so common it's probably more surprising for the musclebound hulk to turn out to be an irreconcilable jerk or bloodthirsty killer.

Two out of three examples of the big guy from the five-man band are likely to be this type. (The other is usually a genius bruiser.)

The typical Gentle Giant is quiet and, while not "book smart" (and sometimes outright stupid), is usually closer to Earth. An occasional subversion of this is to make him the most intelligent member of the group, either as a scientist and tech guy or as a cynic. He may also like things that other guys will think of as "un-manly", and woe to you if you mock him for that.

if someone manages to push him too far, bad things will happen.Compare the grotesque. Contrast the napoleon and killer rabbit. Not to be confused with the British progressive rock band named gentle giant.
