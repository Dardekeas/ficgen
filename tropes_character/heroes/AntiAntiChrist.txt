He's the antichrist, the spawn of satan, a demon destined to bring about the doom of all men and the end of all things.

But he just doesn't feel like it. maybe the relationship between him and dad is strained. Maybe he was raised by humans and shown the ways of love and justice. Perhaps there are just more interesting things to do? Of course, the sheer irony of the ultimate rebel's offspring rebelling against him is delicious. Or maybe, they'd simply reply the way Hellboy would when someone tells him you can't fight fate: "Says who?"

Whatever the reason, this anti christ doesn't feel like it and says, "screw destiny! I'm not causing the end of the world as we know it!" He might even sacrifice himself just to thwart the End of Days, thus dying for our sins.

Of course, the Forces of EvilÂ™ often make it really difficult for themselves; by demanding that their champion kill their lover, their friends, and anyone who is nice to them. Seriously, the Anti Antichrist didn't want to join their club in the first place; how is this supposed to convince them? What did they think the response was going to be? Of course, they don't consider it at all. It's part of the rules, dagnabit. If they actually promised and delivered better living through evil, they might have had more success.

beware the nice ones and the villain with good publicity, though. Remember, even though they've turned against their destiny, it's in the blood. And it's especially bad if the morons around them know about their "destiny" and decide to bully a dragon. That rarely ends well.

While an Anti Anti Christ may side against Team Evil, they are not required to actually be good or nice. And even if they are nice, members of Team Good (often a knight templar) may see their turn as inevitable and seek to end them before they can turn. They may also be accused of playing on Team Good's sympathies and are often the first people to be looked at when something goes wrong... which may in and of itself cause them to turn evil.

Often overlaps with apocalypse maiden, which many Anti Antichrists are by nature. Compare i am not a gun, where a war machine refuses to follow its programming to destroy everything. See also the unchosen one.

Not to be confused with satan is good, which is distinguished by having the apparent bringer of evil be a covert force for good, whereas Anti Antichrists generally represent actual forces of evil, albeit not very well.
