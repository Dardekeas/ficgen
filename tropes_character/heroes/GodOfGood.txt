In many works, there is a god of evil. An ultimate embodiment of evil that seeks to either spread unhappiness or kill as much as he/she wants.

This is the inverse of that, a deity that seeks to defeat evil and/or seeks to spread goodness. In most works with a God of Good, he/she will often (but not always) be the big good, guiding the hero but not getting directly involved in his/her quest to defeat the big bad. In some cases, the god of good's role can be spreading good will or actively repairing that which has been tainted by evil or simply maintaining the world from plain old decay. It might seek to convert all to the setting's standard of goodness, warping hate into love, despair into hope, obsession into indifference where appropriate.

There is a tendency for Gods of Good to be female rather than male. Also, beauty equals goodness (and by proxy hot god) tends to come into play with this trope. There is common overlap with gold and white are divine and light is good.

In many works, there is a conflict between the God of Good and the god of evil. Often, as a take-off of satan, the god of evil is a rebellious underling of the God of Good.

Not in any way to be confused with god is good, which is when there is a single god who is good (though in most monotheistic faiths, god is given this title, and many others like it, so He actually still counts).

 Gods who are nice but mostly defined by other qualities do not qualify. If the god can, by the setting's definition, do evil without contradicting their very being, they don't count.
