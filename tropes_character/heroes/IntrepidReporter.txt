An Intrepid Reporter is an investigative journalist who goes out and finds stories, rather than letting them come to him or her. Sometimes this seems to be the only kind of reporter used in fiction. A character's actual assignment might be something like "tell the readers who won the dog show," or "write a puff piece on our best advertiser," but something about the setup will inevitably spark a full-scale investigation.

This kind of reporter is also known, in fiction, for getting far more involved in their stories than is usually recommended for real journalists. There might be a brief mention of "objectivity" or warning against "getting too emotionally involved," but if there's a corrupt corporate executive to bring down, secret villainy to expose, or a distressed damsel to rescue, the intrepid reporter will be right in there taking an active hand. Sometimes the term "muckraker" is used for this kind of journalist. Expect occasional examples of off the record information, whether or not they violate their journalistic ethics and reveal it.

Most often, the intrepid reporter is a protagonist, or at least on the side of the angels. Expect a lot of speeches about "the Truth", "Freedom of the Press" and "the People have a right to know." But they can also be love interests, antagonists, or even villains. After all, the lure of that big scoop can lead to rushing into danger (not that they all mind that), trying to expose secrets the protagonists would rather not have public, or even fudging the facts to make a juicier story.

The teenage version of this is the school newspaper news hound. An intrepid reporter has a good chance of being a hot scoop as well. The jerk ass or evil counterpart is the paparazzi. If an intrepid reporter has no name, and/or is clearly snooping around somewhere they ''really'' shouldn't be, they are most likely a red shirt reporter as well.
