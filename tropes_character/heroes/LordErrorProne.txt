Bob is on a noble crusade. He talks big and believes all his own hype. In his mind, he is a great and noble hero. However, to everyone else (except maybe a loyal sidekick or newbie) Bob is a buffoon with a head full of ideas about how heroing should be but no real experience. Meet Lord Error-Prone.

This character is a knight in shining armor or knight templar whose ineptitude and lack of common sense makes him more of a nuisance rather than a real threat to whatever he is fighting against. Which is probably good, given his fanatical mindset.Possessing extremely poor judgment, Lord Error-Prone can often be seen rushing to attack opponents he has no chance of defeating (pretty much all of them), oppressing minorities/static objects (surely servants of evil!) and punishing hardened criminal scum such as jaywalkers and litterers. Often bizarrely genre savvy, but this generally backfires (because this is reality) â€” extreme cases may simply be genre savvy for the wrong genre.

If he does manage to accomplish something good, it's usually through sheer luck rather than skill. If he gets lucky enough times to actually get people to believe in him, he may become a fake ultimate hero. If he's very lucky, he may have a hypercompetent sidekick watching his back.

If Lord Error-Prone is meant to be a sympathetic character, he is often portrayed as a well-meaning, but clueless wide-eyed idealist. Otherwise, he is a laughable excuse for a knight at best and a pathetic hypocrite or bully at worst.

Usually played for laughs, but there is something disturbing when one thinks about what might happen if such a character had any real influence.

Don Quixote is perhaps the trope maker, and most characters of this type will end up fighting windmills as a shout-out.

See failure knight. Compare general failure, miles gloriosus, and modern major general. Lord Error-Prone is a knight who errs, but should not be confused with a knight errant.
