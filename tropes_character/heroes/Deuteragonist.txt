Deuteragonist. The second guy. No, not the sidekick, who follows the main character around. Not the supporting protagonist, who is the main character yet not the focus of the story. Not the decoy protagonist either. The second person the show revolves around.

The deuteragonist (from Greek: second actor) is the second important character in the story; the first is, of course, the protagonist. This person can be either with, or against the protagonist - thus sometimes pulling double duty as a major antagonist or rival to the protagonist; though they are rarely the "main villain" in this sort of scenario, they may be a high ranking minion. If on the same side as the protagonist they can be a sidekick, lancer, or love interest as long as they are given enough screen time independent of the main protagonist.

We can see how their actions drive the plot just as much as those of the protagonist. If there's another example of this trope in play following the previous one, then that character is the Tritagonist.An important aspect is that we see quite a bit of the story from this character's point of view, and that they get a good amount of screen time/pages.

Subtropes include supporting leader. The sidekick or the lancer can become a deuteragonist if given enough focus on their own. In a romance story, the official couple will usually be the protagonist and deuteragonist. If a character seems like a deuteragonist but doesn't get as much screentime, they're likely the hero of another story. Compare two lines, no waiting, where the plots don't actually intersect.

dramatica calls this character the Impact Character, while the hollywood formula refers to this as the Relationship character.
