Heroism is a high-risk job. When the chosen one is the only one who can defeat the big bad, the big bad and their evil minions are going to be coming after the hero everywhere they go. You may be the only one who can protect the city, or the kingdom, or the magical land, or the universe, but while you're working on that, who's going to protect you?

You need the ! Twenty-four hour protection from any and all accidental or intentional premature causes of death that may hinder you on the hero's journey. They'll keep your secret identity secret, guard you while moving between headquarters, provide distractions, take out the mooks so you can save your strength, and if necessary, make heroic sacrifices for you, thereby providing substantial heroic resolve to get you through the culminating grand battle.

Working for the Hero Secret Service is also hazardous. contractual immortality is significantly decreased, and it's not personal as far as the big bad is concerned, so the evil minions for once have full permission to kill. On the other hand, while the big bad is surrounded by idiots, the Hero Secret Service does not hire any crazy guards... unless they're a volunteer amazon brigade assigned to protect the one guy.

Taking advantage of the Hero Secret Service is not optional, so save your breath about not wanting to put anyone else in danger for your sake, or how they can't hope to ever help.

This job position is also cynically referred to as being a "Meat Shield." Just ask the red shirts of Star Trek.

Sometimes run by la r√©sistance. If the hero is royalty, this may be praetorian guard. Always more expendable than the hero. See also poisonous friend, who sees himself as protecting the hero but has a worse code of ethics than the hero when it comes to harming the hero's enemies.
