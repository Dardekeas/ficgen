The Supporting Leader is a secondary character who leads the forces of good in their struggle against the big bad. He isn't the main protagonist of the series, but generally gets a spotlight episode focusing on some important battle right as the actual heroes are off performing whatever task winds up actually saving the day. This character is often the deuteragonist.

the brigadier and the captain may be his underlings. The heroes who actually defeat the big bad may also be in his or her chain of command, but they're more likely to be an independent force of their own; their personal struggle is usually for the golden snitch while the Supporting Leader keeps the big bad from winning by default.

Pretty much found in any story where a kid is the hero. One of the surrounding adults will take on the role.

A variation of this is common in gaming, where following an initial battle, the player's nominal superior will tell them that the main battle is in hand and they need to proceed to the special objective that is the real centerpiece of the mission.

Sometimes this character will be the true hero of the story, and the central character will be the supporting protagonist. When the leader is the protagonist, rather than a secondary hero, it's a protagonist shall lead them.

Compare big good, and the lancer. Contrast with hero protagonist. If the battle scenes seem like they'd be pretty interesting in their own right, this character may be the hero of another story.

A specific sub-trope to the leader naturally.
