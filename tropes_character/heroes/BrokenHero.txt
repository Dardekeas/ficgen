A hero who is a dropout, result of a failed experiment (in sci-fi), or maybe just abandoned/abused as a child. Nonetheless, this character is amazingly cheerful and optimistic, and nice to even the people who don't appreciate them. May be introduced as a big eater, a ditz, or some other harmless personality. They may even make some ostensibly humorous jabs at themself.

Their back story is usually learned in flashbacks sometime later in a show, sometimes without warning. This can shock the other characters, especially the rival anti-hero, and earns them respect.

A beta test baddie and a Broken Hero often have a complicated relationship of sympathy tied with dislike, until the former finally loses patience with the latter.
