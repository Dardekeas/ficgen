Being a superhero isn't all it's cracked up to be. The heroes' lives and those of their loved ones are constantly in danger from their archnemesesâ€”and sometimes from their own powers, too. Sometimes someone else takes credit for their heroic efforts. But perhaps the most hurtful and confusing drawback comes when the people they've sworn to protect hate their guts.

This could arise for any number of reasons:

 Resulting from the hero's actions:

But whatever the reason, public sentiment is against these heroes, and there's usually nothing they can do about it. Sorry - you can't please everyone.

What one may view as a Hero with Bad Publicity, others feel to be a villain with good publicity, so No Real Life Examples, Please!
