Whoopee. the chosen one has finally arrived to the stock town and everyone is rejoicing because they're saved fromâ€”

... oh, no. The Chosen One's a complete moron. Or the klutz. Or a greedy jerkass. Or a coward. Or he/she hates his/her job as chosen one.

The phrase "Is this really the Chosen One?" or "Who chose him or her?" usually comes up once or twice. Also common: "we're doomed." As a result the inept/jerkish person has to be trained and hardened into a suitable warrior. By the time that's done, the trainer is convinced and, later, so is everyone else.

Often played for comedic effect. Sometimes the chosen one beats the enemy purely because he is an idiot.
