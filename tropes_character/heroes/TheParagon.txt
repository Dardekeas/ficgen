A character who lives to help others, but in a way that shows those people how to help themselves. This character does not believe in holding out for a hero. This character's ultimate goal is that one day, when the people need a hero, they can be the heroes themselves.

Lest this Aesop break in the telling (a person with superpowers telling Muggles how to live their lives?), the understanding Paragon will emphasize that each person must strive to goodness within their abilities.

A common form of this is a hero helping a town, and at the end, the people are inspired by this character's courage, and help fight off the big bad.

If The Paragon works under the big good and decides he could do a better job, beware the paragon always rebels.

values dissonance can turn the paragon into a jerk with a heart of gold or a designated hero. Usually a small steps hero, and justified that doing individual acts of kindness makes the world a better place overall.

Compare the cape, captain patriotic, fixer sue, inspirational martyr, a protagonist shall lead them, the paladin.
