Good guys are happy, right? good feels good, and, as such, a hero should always feel spectacular, right?

Not always.

Sometimes, being the chosen one is hard, especially when it puts your life in danger, consumes all your free time, and makes you choose between being alone or putting your loved ones in danger.Heroic powers can have a terrifying will of their own and be hard to control and demand that a price be paid. If the Hurting Hero jumped at the call, they'll probably wish they had been careful what they wished for and think i just want to be normal.

Heroes are also not immune to personal tragedy and the memory of certain events and people can haunt them like everyone else. A dark and troubled past can make them not even find peace in their sleep. the audience will love them for it, in that twisted and tender way they love the woobie.

Different heroes handle this different ways. Some get dark and broody, some drink, some cease to care how they look. Some play the idiot, and some force a smile and crack bad jokes because if the whole world thinks you're happy, that many people can't be wrong. can they?Sometimes, the pressure gets too great, leading to anything from a heroic bsod, to a full-on fallen hero face-heel turn. Some heroes go don't you dare pity me!, others are glad for a little comfort.

Still, heroes are heroes. They can and will rise above their weakness and pain and declare for everyone and the villain to come and see what they can do. And they'll do it, thus earning their happy ending.

Compare being good sucks. May cause a villain or bystander to express sympathy for the hero.
