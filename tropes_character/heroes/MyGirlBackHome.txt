In cultures with a tradition of adventuring, there is often a yearly tragedy in which families are temporarily split up because some of the men have to be away trading, or fighting or bringing animals to market or the like. This brings in the character known as My Girl Back Home. She is almost always female (hence the title), though a child or an old man would work. The male version of Girls Back Home waiting for female adventurers are only a recent storytelling innovation, as adventuring was mostly masculine work in most cultures and time periods and stories reflected that.

Girls Back Home tend to be spouses or lovers though anyone with whom the character in question has a close relationship will do. Expect a Girl Back Home to be the woobie, though she will likely hide her emotions under a shell of stoicism, at least until she is alone. In the meantime, they will always worry about her and feel guilty for leaving. That never persuades him to stay home, of course, because otherwise we won't have a story. Another trait of Girls Back Home is that they often occupy only a small part of the story except in the thoughts of The Hero.

Also, no matter what happens, if you have a girl back home, DON'T show a photo of her to anyone!
