The heroic counterpart to the egomaniac hunter and the evil poacher, the Great White Hunter is a heroic big game hunter. He is most likely a gentleman adventurer, but he could also be an earthier type who leads safaris for a living. Either way, he will be an expert tracker, a crack shot, and skilled at wilderness survival.

deliberate values dissonance might come up if the story is trying to impart an aesop about respecting the lives of wild animals. Often, however, this character does admire animals even as he kills them, considering them a worthy opponent of sorts.

The Great White Hunter is something of a dead horse trope. When he still appears, it will either be in a period piece or he will be leading expeditions to capture animals alive. May wear an adventurer outfit.

Despite his title, not always white... and not always all that great, either.
