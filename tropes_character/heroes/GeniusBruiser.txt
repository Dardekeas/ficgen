A big guy who is also a geek or tech-head. Often coupled with gentle giant to subvert two tropes at once.

Basically what happens when you put brains and brawn as one character. It's a possible benefit when you carry a heavy doorstopper or two (or a whole shelf of them) while using it as weight-lifts and studying calculus at the same time.

The diametric opposite of dumb muscle. This guy has not only huge muscles and fists, but a very bright brain! There is, however, a difference between "especially smart" and "not a total moron"; keep that in mind when adding examples. Here's a tip: A character who is strong but displays frankly average intelligence is simply not an idiot. But if they constantly spout technobabble and are considered an expert in some scientific field, that's especially smart. Similarly, if they're especially smart, they must also be unusually strong to qualify. "Beats people up" or "very physically fit" don't exactly count.

The inversion is the badass bookworm. In general, a Genius Bruiser looks huge and powerfully muscled, then unexpectedly shows off an intellectual side, whereas a badass bookworm looks like a standard geek, but then displays a surprising amount of physical prowess. Remember, in this case muscles are not meaningless. The person needs to look the part to qualify for this trope. If authority equals asskicking, you may well end up with an emperor scientist. A Genius Bruiser is almost always also a cultured badass, but the two aren't necessarily always found in the same individual.

In fantasy, a Genius Bruiser is often a magic knight or a mighty glacier. Also tends to be combined with lightning bruiser, as the speed is frequently tied into intelligence or very specific training. See also minored in ass kicking. In a five-man band specializing in brains, is the big guy. In a five-man band specializing in brawn, is the smart guy. Contrast with shorter means smarter.
