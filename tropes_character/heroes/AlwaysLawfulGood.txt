A whole race or culture of fair and benevolent beings. Obviously, inverted always chaotic evil. Sadly enough, not truth in television, but that's why these races exist: to show humans that they need to improve themselves.

This alignment is often justified by the race being somehow "close to Light".

This trope is certainly very idealistic and is used mostly in shows with black and white morality. The more cynical shows love to subvert it by revealing they are not as good as they appeared.

Common examples of Always Lawful Good:

 It is said that  Angels, if they are  "Angels in the house", perhaps better known as    Both this trope and always chaotic evil are less frequently used, especially with classical versions of this trope such as angels, elves, and fairies all increasingly portrayed as at best just as fallible as humanity. In extreme cases one or the other can disappear,

depending whether the setting says silly rabbit, idealism is for kids! or silly rabbit, cynicism is for losers!. Either that, or both start to move towards the middle of the moral scale, as the setting becomes grayer in general.

Often a whole race of the beautiful elite or an inhumanly beautiful race, since beauty equals goodness. Compare noble profession. May be employed with alike and antithetical adversaries. This is a planet of hats where the "hat" is being good. For this trope applied to humanity, see humans are good.

 While a race can literally be Always lawful good and apply for this trope, this also extends to races that are also Always neutral good and Always chaotic good, or races that have lawful good, neutral good and chaotic good individuals, but no evil individuals of any kind.
