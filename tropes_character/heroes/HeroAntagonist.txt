A Hero Antagonist is a character who is an antagonist (that is, they oppose the protagonist), yet is still technically a hero. They oppose the main character and may not even have sympathetic p.o.v., but their objectives are things like saving the world, saving large groups of people, or saving anybody's life if they have the chance. A tweaking of the narrative could easily make them a sympathetic protagonist.

Usually, this character's main concern is that the protagonist, either intentionally or not, may bring up a scenario that would spell doom for the world or, depending on the scale of the narrative, a single person. How they come to this conclusion varies. They may be misinformed as to the nature of their enemy. They could be completely correct in their assertions because the main character is a villain protagonist or anti-hero. In any of these events, the Hero Antagonist is able to keep their good alignment while still being the narrative's opposition.
