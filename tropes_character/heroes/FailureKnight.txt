A character with an empathic level of devotion to another character they may not have known very long. Such a character will often matter-of-factly explain it as chivalry, destiny or whatever. Everyone who knows the other character will envy the situation, or tolerate it with minimal embarrassment. So far they seem to be a simple satellite character.

Then we find out the tragic back story about their greatest failure. This isn't the first person they've pledged devotion to, and the former died, left or outright rejected them; it may have happened repeatedly. In some cases this role was a job of some kind, which gives the added punch to the gut to make them feel useless. The Failure Knight keeps trying even harder now.

Bodyguards, battle butlers and samurai can fit the bill too. Some (literal) magical girlfriends are Failure Knights, but are perceived as a lot more cloying about it. Many knights will find promotion: their boss treats their failure as a career building blunder. In particularly grim examples, the new object of devotion may be a replacement goldfish for the lost one.
