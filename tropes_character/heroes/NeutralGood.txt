The character alignment of sweetness and light. A Neutral Good character will usually comply with laws if doing so benefits the greater good, but rebel against those they consider unjust or which conflict with the greater good.

There are different kinds of Neutral Goodness:

 Type 1 are those who are passively good — they have fairly normal lives and ambitions, but will do good as the situation arises. They will help anyone they come across who needs it, then get back to their normal routine. They are most likely to be good towards family, friends, and those within their social circle (if they are a  Type 2 are those who are actively good — for them, Goodness is an Ideal as well as (or less likely, instead of) an obligation. They devote themselves to a life of Goodness and doing Good is the most important thing in their lives, or one of at least. They believe in doing what is Right and may sacrifice personal happiness, perhaps even in advance, in pursuit of that. If they are not an Neutral Good can be the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order. Neutral Good characters value freedom and will protect others' freedom as long as it's not used to do harm.

A Neutral Good character is not too caught up in order versus chaos; they are concerned with moral goodness, but often not willing to enforce it in others. Something of a 'classic' hero or adventurer alignment as seen in many RPGs and JRPGs, as well as many anime series, particularly shōnen (although most of them are chaotic good nowadays) or more idealistic Seinen works.

A Neutral Good character is sometimes a friend to all living things and/or a technical pacifist, but they don't necessarily have to be either. Just think "basically good person" and you've probably got it. If they do decide to take up arms, they may have a particular affinity with kneecap and other non-lethal shots.

Neutral Good states may be really nice places to live, but depending on how idealistic the setting is, they may be deluding themselves. Neutral Good characters tend to suffer more personal conflicts in grey and grey morality settings with order versus chaos themes.

However, before you all run up to this alignment expecting it to hand out unconditional love and free cake, a small word of caution: if this alignment is combined with good is not Soft, things can get interesting and you could end up with a granny weatherwax Type neutral good character. That is to say, someone who will always, always do what they believe is right, and wont let either laws or personal freedoms get in their way. If played properly alongside good is not Nice, this alignment can be downright scary.

Like chaotic good, neutral good is an alignment which is driven by an internal, rather than external code of morality. The difference between Chaotic and Neutral here is that neutral good is more pragmatic and usually (although not always) more moderate. neutral good's internal definition of Goodness is what directs them, irrespective of the presence or absence of an externally enforced legal code. If abiding by the law is the most expedient means of accomplishing a goal which is internally defined as Good, then that is what neutral good will do. If, on the other hand, they live in an environment with laws that they consider unjust, or which impede them in doing what they internally define as Good, then they will quite happily (although usually a bit more hesitantly and carefully than Chaotic) break said laws.

neutral good is primarily dangerous because the alignment is primarily concerned with Good results, whereas the means employed to achieve those ends are usually considered irrelevant. A fanatical neutral good can therefore be just as dangerous as chaotic good, if their internal heuristics get screwed up.

If you have a difficulty deciding which alignment a good-aligned character belongs to, the main difference between lawful good, Neutral Good, and chaotic good is not their devotion to good, but the methods they believe are best to promote it:

 Even though there are some situations where they can't always use this method,  Neutral Good characters are indifferent to  Most Neutral Good character types include:
