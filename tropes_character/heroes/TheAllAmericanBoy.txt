He is marked by his love of baseball, by having a skill with rural machinery and hunting firearms beyond his years, and his propensity to emit sounds like "gee whiz". The All-American boy usually dwells in a quirky town in the heart of eagleland within which he is as free as the air, pedaling everywhere on his bicycle. He is naive but charming and always polite, and he treats his parents (who most likely are a standard '50s father and a house wife) and other elders with respect. He is probably a boy scout (or a Cub Scout if still in elementary school). If he has a sibling, it will be an older brother to idolize or a little sister to protect â€” perhaps both.

The high-school variety wears a letterman's sweater, plays football or baseball, and spends his off hours using his mechanical skills to restore an old car.
