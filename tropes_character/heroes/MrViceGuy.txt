An ultimately heroic or good character nonetheless associated with an obvious vice.

Mr Vice Guy avoids being an unsympathetic comedy protagonist or villain protagonist in that while they have obvious greed, lust, pride, wrath, etc. it never completely outweighs their good qualities or sense of right. In some instances it weighs equally, and they feel justified making minor exploitations of their co-stars.

An easy way to create an arch-enemy for this character is to make an evil counterpart that embodies the exact same vice, but doesn't have the morals that Mr Vice Guy has to keep it in check.

Beware! If he ever has to get over his addiction or make a face-heel turn, then it's "no more mr vice guy..!"

A mr. vice guy with more prominent vices will overlap somewhat with anti-hero in that, while they have obvious flaws, they are still ultimately good.

Compare fatal flaw, good is not nice, good is not soft, jerk with a heart of gold. Contrast evil virtues, for a villainous character with one or more obvious virtues. Consider also compressed vice and compressed abstinence.
