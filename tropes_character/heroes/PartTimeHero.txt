The Part-Time Hero wants to save the world, sure. He wants everyone to be happy and alive, but he also wants a normal life.

So she's going to balance fighting off those demonic invaders with cheerleading practice or her job or dating. They're going to have episodes, even entire arcs dedicated to resenting their double life. (Particularly their fighting evil side cutting into their "me time.") This is a very popular trope in anime, especially for magical girls (who have to balance their duties as heroines against the joys of homework and getting up to go to school in the morning).

This often includes the superhero with a secret identity, but not all of them. spider-man is more of an example than batman is. Includes all wake up, go to school, save the world series, of course.

Compare punch clock villain. Contrast the punch clock hero, who seems similar at first but is far less heroic when he is not, well, being a hero.
