The lady of war crossed with the gentleman adventurer. She doesn't just find excitement — she specifically seeks it out. She thinks nothing of beating up pirates off the coast of the trucial states or outwitting remnant tribes of mayincatec humanitarians.

She is a high-class lady (though usually not a member of royalty), self sufficient, but not willing to get tied down in marriage (though she may find love in her travels, she will always choose adventure over love — not even defrosting will help). Sometimes, her big fancy house will contain mementos of past adventures. At home, she may be a proper lady but her activities would frighten her more domestic counterparts.

Most often, she will have no powers of her own (though she may have some small degree of physical prowess), but will surround herself with a band of friends that will help her on her travails. Will almost certainly live to become a cool old lady.

Usually filled to the brim with british stuffiness and almost always wears gorgeous period dress (while still fitting for the high seas and hot sun). Often found in the edwardian era.

Compare and contrast lady of war. Often wears a ladylike adventurer outfit.
