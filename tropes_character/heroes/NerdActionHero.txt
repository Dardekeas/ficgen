When a character is primarily a nerd (or possibly geek), but still manages to pull off feats of action heroism, then he (or she) is a Nerd Action Hero.

Sometimes this is the result of character development, where the character starts out as a nerd but over time develops heroic skills. In other cases the character is a hidden badass.

Sometimes a nerd action hero may be paired with an action girl, and aforementioned character development may occur as a result of their interaction.

There is an overlap with badass bookworm, but many of those are badass first and bookworm only as a bonus. There can also be an overlap with science hero, but a nerd action hero tends to do more ordinary action hero things (shooting, fighting, jumping, etc.) when the action starts.

For characters who generally take guile hero or the smart guy roles to the point where viewers might even forget they're devastatingly effective at getting physical, they might have minored in ass kicking.
