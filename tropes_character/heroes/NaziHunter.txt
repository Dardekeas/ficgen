Someone who dedicates their life to hunting down ex-Nazis, or is dedicated to hunting down one particular Nazi because of what they did in world war ii (note: this trope doesn't apply just because the antagonist happens to be an ex-Nazi). Often a badass israeli who might be working for Mossad, a result of the high-profile kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann from argentinia in 1960. In reality, Mossad stopped chasing war criminals not long after this event, as more urgent threats to Israel took priority.

Expect the former Nazi to be living somewhere in south america in his well-guarded mansion financed by nazi gold, from which he plots the return of the third reich. Hardly truth in television, as genuine war criminals go to some trouble to avoid drawing attention to themselves. And this usually involves living modestly and often working in low end jobs such as manual labor. And as far as all that nazi gold, there are some other more plausible theories about where it ended up.

Something of a dead horse trope these days, as anyone who served in world war ii gets too long in the tooth to be anything other than a nazi grandpa. And the generation that would have been old enough to be movers and shakers in the Nazi party would now be centenarians. Finally, the end of the cold war dramatically expanded the choice of stock villains.

However, there are Neo-Nazi hunters in real life, who are dedicated to making life Hell for anyone they suspect of being a Neo-Nazi or sympathizer, and many of whom are affiliated with the Punk Rock music scene. Groups and movements such as Anti-Fascist Action and Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (yes, really) are a prominent example of this type of modern-day nazi hunter. Ironically, these groups are often perceived by outsiders as even more militant and obnoxious than the modern-day Nazis themselves.

Very common in nazisploitation films.
