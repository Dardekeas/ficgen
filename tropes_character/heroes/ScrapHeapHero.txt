Sometimes when a hero has a heroic bsod the retirement is longer than ten minutes. Maybe the hero failed altogether or fell victim to their own personal demons. Sometimes the hero has just grown old. Whatever the reason for it, the hero has been at best forgotten and is perhaps even actively despised or ridiculed, a has been or even worse a never was. Sometimes, though, things happen, and like it or not the the Scrap Heap Hero rises first from the ashes and then to the occasion, showing everybody just what they once did or could have done had things gone differently.

Do not confuse with the scrappy, although both tropes might overlap during the period when the hero's down and out. Nearly always results in he's back. Could overlap with retired badass, compare with let's get dangerous. When a group of Scrap Heap Heroes reform, it's putting the band back together.
