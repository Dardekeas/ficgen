Red shows up a lot when it comes to the heroes of a story, usually the color of their clothing. This could be limited to the main protagonist, or be as wide as an entire badass army. Some chromatic arrangement trios have the leader wear red.

The reason is that red is the color of fire and blood, hence the color of action. Thus it conveys that the heroes are people of action as well (regardless of exactly how the heroism is presented in the show). Red is, along with blue and white, one of the three colours of the star-spangled banner, so any US superhero that feels like wearing a flag on his head will likely use a combination of these colors.

In Japan this was traditional in old Kabuki plays and the like. It's made to represent the hero bathed in the blood of his enemies. It is much less common in America due to the association with red as the color of the country's enemies (redcoat British in the Revolutionary War, red scares and the cold war in the 20th century), but gets a pass if it's paired with white and/or blue.

A sub-trope of good colors, evil colors.

A super trope to red-headed hero, primary-color champion.

A sister trope to fire is red and blue is heroic.

Compare heroes want redheads, bring my red jacket, heroes prefer swords, color-coded characters, purple is powerful, law of chromatic superiority, satan is good.
