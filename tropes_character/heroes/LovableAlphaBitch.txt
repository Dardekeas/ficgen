So, there's this girl. She's beautiful, popular, manipulative, exclusive and... not so bad once you get to know her. She still hangs out with the popular crowd, regularly attends wild teen parties, and has been known to be vicious and petty to the unfortunates at the bottom of the popularity food chain with some rare occasions of pet the dog in between. She may even act this way toward the heroine at first. But a few bonding activities and a little character development later, she's the one who has the heroine's back, with whom she often forms a tomboy and girly girl pair.

Note that the Lovable Alpha Bitch doesn't have to be pally with or even nice to the heroine's true companions, although she usually tolerates most of them. It also doesn't mean that she won't continue her alpha bitchy ways toward other unfortunate victims... just not toward the heroine. In a lot of cases, a Lovable Alpha Bitch will be joined by a beta bitch who is the really nasty one and will resent the relationship between her and the heroine. Basically, she is an anti villainous Alpha Bitch.

Compare spoiled sweet, where the character has all the trappings of the alpha bitch (contrast that trope) but never really is one; fallen princess, where the alpha bitch has to lose her status to become sympathetic; and academic alpha bitch, who might care about her classmates as long as they know she's the best in the school. May overlap with jerk with a heart of gold, defrosting ice queen, sugar and ice personality, or sometimes big bad wannabe.
