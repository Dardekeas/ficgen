These guys are loved and celebrated by their people, whether they deserve to be or not, but have a hard time getting admiration from anyone else. It could be that the outside world simply does not know of their good deeds, but it's more likely they did something to make the outside world very upset. Their comrades may not know the details, they may not care about what makes other people angry, or they may not believe the accusations of the outsiders. Another case is that people are not impressed with a so-called hero, seeing him as a big fish in a small pond. Whatever reasons these heroes be unheard of, hated, or disrespected, they can rest assured knowing they are heroes to their hometowns.

An affably evil or well-intentioned villain is especially likely to be this. May be a consequence of the hero's moral myopia (as well as the community's, if they both know he's doing horrible things to other people and support him despite it... or because of it). Contrast: never accepted in his hometown, no hero to his valet, 100% heroism rating. Despite the name, it has little to do with home town hero, which is a story about someone from the area it is told in.
