Item #: SCP-2302

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2302 is to be stored in a standard containment safe, equipped with surge-protected audio inputs, on Site-93. As SCP-2302 is itself poses no immediate danger to Foundation personnel, containment should emphasize minimizing the damaging effects, be they physical, cultural or psychological, of FERENTES. Communications with SCP-2302-1 are to be recorded and backed up offsite in the event of SCP-2302-2 causing damage to onsite data storage facilities.

In the event that an instance of SCP-2302-2 arrives onsite and a FERENTES Event commences, all personnel, save those tasked with ongoing negotiations with SCP-2302-1, will immediately ingest Class-C amnestics/anesthetic compounds and position themselves away from doors and windows. When the negotiation team has declared the all-clear and onsite threat response teams have located and disposed of the instance(s) of SCP-2302-1, offsite medical staff will move to assist the reawakening of all site staff.

All personnel on Site-93 are reminded that any verbal utterance of the words "jubilation", "token", or "castration"1 in the English language or any modern dialect thereof may trigger a FERENTES Event, and should avoid using English as a spoken language except when in direct contact with SCP-2302.

Description: SCP-2302 is a standard ████████-brand electronic loudspeaker, of the make and model installed on Site-93 during on site maintenance in 1998.2 SCP-2302 is able to recieve audio signals from an unknown source, and can continue broadcasting audio even when disconnected from a power source3. SCP-2302 has been confirmed to be structurally normal and non-anomalous, although disassembly of the loudspeaker has invariably triggered a response from SCP-2302-1 and FERENTES.

SCP-2302-1 is an entity which claims to be in control of the communications center of an alternate-universe version of Site-93 and uses SCP-2302 to deliver messages to Foundation personnel. SCP-2302-1 has only ever communicated in American English, and does not appear to be able to understand any other language. SCP-2302-1 speaks with a General American accent, and uses grammar and a vocabulary consistent with a university-educated native English speaker. In conversation, SCP-2302-1's has been described as "pleasant" or "enthusiastic" with the exception of the replacement of key nouns and adjectives in sentences with allegorical or nonsensical alternatives spoken in a tone of voice three octaves lower. Analysis of SCP-2302's audio has revealed that this second tone is SCP-2302-1's voice, pitch-shifted and spliced into the audio feed in real time. SCP-2302-1 has refused to elaborate on the nature of its speech patterns or its word substitutions.

SCP-2302-1 can be communicated with by connecting SCP-2302 to a microphone as normal. Audio input from the Foundation universe appears to be broadcast in what SCP-2302-1 claims is its universe, and vice-versa. Since initial contact on █/██/2███, SCP-2302-1 has consistently attempted to gain control of Site-93 through spurious messages purporting to be senior staff, and concurrently to negotiate what it describes as a "funtime [sic] happy game plan", or mutual friendship agreement, with the Foundation. SCP-2302-1 utilizes instances of SCP-2302-2 as bargaining tools or gifts in its ongoing attempts to gain concessions from Foundation personnel.

SCP-2302-2 are objects which SCP-2302-1 is able to anomalously create or place in Site-93. SCP-2302-2 have taken a wide variety of forms, but all are characterized by a tendency to materialize just inside of interior doors and windows. The act of witnessing a materialization- codenamed FERENTES- triggers mild to severe symptoms of automatonophobia4, omphalophobia5, and social anxiety. FERENTES effects only occur if the subject is conscious while in the presence of SCP-2302-2 materialization: unconsciousness and mild amnestics have proven to be adequate countermeasures against exposure. Most instances of SCP-2302-2 have been non-anomalous and harmless, but several have proven to have deleterious effects. All instances of SCP-2302-2 recovered to date have been at least partially composed of human gastric acid. SCP-2302-1 can consciously trigger SCP-2302-2 materializations, but appears to be forced or compelled to do so when it hears one of several specific English words (See above).

Other notes

SCP-2302-2-46

Gift-wrapped tube containing 104 3mm-thick slices of human adipose tissue in a dilute (1%) aqueous solution of human gastric acid.

Genetic analysis of tissue matched that of Site-93 Administrator E████████.

SCP-2302-2-172

Three ceramic jars of concentrated human gastric acid, equipped with a motion-controlled aerosol dispersal system.

Two Site security personnel injured by chemical burns.

SCP-2302-2-290

Sculpture of a wrapped 'present' composed of an unidentified compacted white powder.

Chemical analysis revealed powder to be 75% pure cocaine, 0.5% hydrogen chloride, 0.5% potassium chloride, 0.5% sodium chloride6, 23.5% bacillus anthracis spores by mass.

SCP-2302-2-681

Decorative basket of cut Begonia grandis7, mounted atop a 30-kg base of purified weapons-grade Pu-239. Object had apparently been doused in concentrated human gastric acid before delivery.

Sample disposed of. Arrival area is heavily irradiated.

Addendum 2: Sample SCP-2302 Communication

Following the three subsqeuent FERENTES events on ██/██/2███, and significant radiation damage to Site-93's backup generating systems, Researcher K████ opened communications with SCP-2302-1 in an attempt to minimize further materializations. Tonal shifts from SCP-2302 are marked in italics.

Researcher K████: I will ask you once again, SCP-2302-1. Please refrain from delivering gifts into Site-critical areas. You have already done enough.

SCP-2302-1: We are disappointed that you did not swallow your medicines. They were furious when we appointed them! All that sauce, just spilt all over!

Researcher K████: The effort is appreciated, believe us. However if we are to negotiate the, uh-

SCP-2302-1: Negotiate? No! Together we will inject the game plan! By the mixing of our fluids, it will be happy fun!

Researcher K████: I'm sorry, mixing of the fluids? You've lost me.

SCP-2302-1: We are great fans of fluids! So many splashes in your bellies! What comfort! What peacefulness! But we digress- one thousand apologies! It was a failure! No mixing or stomach rips, only speech and cooperation!

Researcher K████: Very well. The Foundation accepts your apology. Can we agree to put this regrettable incident behind us? And that you will no longer send us radioactive… gifts?

SCP-2302-1: Jubilation! Naturally! We would be pleased to crawl inside you! No more tokens! Of course! And when the time comes for your castration, for the emancipation… Well, I have spoken too much! Keep happily digesting! In the mean time, cheerful chats!

1. Variations on these words, such as "castrate", or similar words in other languages do not trigger this effect.

2. For exact item specifications, see Foundation Standarized Equipment Manifest FSEM-39/A, 'Audio-Visual Equipment'.

3. Site-93 engineering personnel have noted slight increases in power load during the activation of SCP-2302, although these load increases are not consistent with the amount of power needed to supply a ████████ loudspeaker.

4. Fear of objects which resemble, but do not adequately depict the human form.

5. Fear of human navels.

6. Hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride and salt are the primary components of human gastric acid.

7. Common Hardy Begonia.
