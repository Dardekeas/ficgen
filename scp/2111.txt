SCP-2111 structure pre-containment

Item #: SCP-2111

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: As SCP-2111 instances have only been located in New York City, Mobile Task Force Pi-1 ("City Slickers") is currently involved in the locating and acquisition of SCP-2111 instances. All civilians in the immediate area who are unaffected by SCP-2111 are to be evacuated from the area. All civilians affected by SCP-2111 are to be administered Class-A Amnestics.

When discovered, SCP-2111 structures must be dismantled systematically from the top down. Remote controlled rotorcraft may be utilized for this purpose if necessary. All components of any SCP-2111 structure are to be incorporated into the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation recycling system, save for SCP-2111. One SCP-2111 instance is to be stored in a standard containment locker in Site-45. All other SCP-2111 instances are to be destroyed.

Description: SCP-2111 refers to a glass beer bottle, similar to the Industry Standard Bottle utilized in North America. SCP-2111 weighs 0.5 kg and has a capacity of 355 ml. No manufacturing marks can be found.

SCP-2111 is activated when placed upright on the floor. Any conscious human who comes within 4 m of SCP-2111 during activation is subject to its effect. Subjects affected by SCP-2111 will attempt to locate a piece of recyclable refuse and place it near or onto SCP-2111. After placing a piece of refuse, the affected subject will return to regular activity. Subjects who have been affected with SCP-2111 are unable to recall their interaction with the object.

SCP-2111 affected subjects place refuse in a complex manner as to create a large towering structure. Cardboard and plastic are utilized as the main components and building blocks, and glass bottles can be found near the middle of the structure, while aluminum and metals are used as a base. Each SCP-2111 structure is unique in size and shape. SCP-2111 structures appear to be unaffected by physical conventions, allowing them to stand unaffected by gravity or weather.

In order to facilitate the construction of a SCP-2111 structure, affected individuals will begin to create a human ladder system, in which a subject will climb onto the shoulders of another subject. This ladder is utilized to attach more refuse to the SCP-2111 structure. Refuse is passed from the bottom of the ladder to the top, and another rung is added as required. At approximately 10 m, the ladder will collapse, severely injuring or killing SCP-2111 affected persons and bystanders. The SCP-2111 structure remains in place.

SCP-2111 in this stage is only deactivated by adhering to a rigid set of protocols. The structure must be dismantled from the top down. Then, all refuse is to be recycled. How SCP-2111 keeps track of each piece of refuse is unknown. Deviations in deactivation protocol and premature destruction of SCP-2111 will result in all glass beer bottles found in the structure to become SCP-2111 instances.

A small paper containing a note has been found in the fifth discovered instance.

Stop ruining things. Can't you see I'm giving out purpose? Yes, life without purpose is nothing. Art gives purpose, gives life to all. I reuse useless people. For art, you see. They recycle useless things, I recycle useless things. Earth is very useless thing. I give purpose. Art. Art from useless thing is not useless art, yes? Useless object art is not true art, but useless people is true art. Take note to record.
