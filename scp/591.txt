Scan of picture contained within SCP-591

Item #: SCP-591

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-591 may be safely stored in a standard locked safe-deposit box in Site-19's High Value Storage Facility. All samples under the effect of SCP-591 are to be incinerated after regular testing. During testing, it is recommended that all non-test observation of SCP-591 be done via photographs or video feed, as this does not trigger its effect.

Description: SCP-591 is a framed water color painting of a boy sitting on a stone bridge over a river. The painting is contained in an ornate 28 x 36 cm walnut picture frame of mid-twentieth century origin. The original painter has been identified as █████ ██████. When SCP-591 is hung or placed on a wood surface it should be considered active. While active, a viewing of SCP-591 that lasts one (1) or more minutes will trigger its effect and anomalies will begin to form out of wood grains and knots in the wooden surface SCP-591 is in contact with. Over the course of a week these anomalies take on the shapes of faces. During the week after the initial appearance of face-like features, the anomaly will slowly become a better likeness of the individual that initiated growth. After approximately 175 hours the face will become an almost perfect copy of the initiator's. When the face is fully formed, the initiator will experience at least a 50% loss of sight and hearing, and significant trauma to facial features.

Experiment Log

Subject: One (1) D-class personnel

Experiment: Subject told to observe SCP-591 (hung on wooden wall) for one (1) minute before exiting testing room.

Results: Face of subject begins to form. After one (1) week subject experiences blindness as well as difficulty speaking and numbness of tongue. Subject retains blindness after incineration of wall.

Subject: One (1) D-class personnel

Experiment: Subject told to observe SCP-591 (hung on wooden wall) for one (1) minute before exiting testing room.

Results: Four (4) days into experiment, subject is terminated. Image on wall ceases to transform, remains fixed in the configuration at time of subject's termination.

Subject: Two (2) D-class personnel

Experiment: Subjects told to observe SCP-591 (hung on wooden wall) for one (1) minute before exiting testing room.

Results: Two faces appear on wall. After one (1) week, one (1) subject experiences blindness while the other loses sense of smell.

Subject: Two (2) D-class personnel

Experiment: Subjects observe SCP-591 hung on a 28 x 36 cm, 3 cm thick wooden board hung on a plastic wall.

Results: Faces do not appear on wood behind SCP-591. Sides of wooden board grow knots and grains in no discernible pattern. After one (1) week subjects experience a "haze" in eyes.

Subject: One (1) D-class personnel

Experiment: SCP-591 hung on particle board wall. Subject observes for one (1) minute.

Results: No faces are observed growing, After one (1) week subject begins to develop dry marks and bruises across the face.

Subject: One (1) D-class personnel

Experiment: Picture is removed from frame and fastened to wall. Subject observes the painting for one (1) full minute.

Results: No faces appear on wood. Subject experiences no effects.

Subject: One (1) D-class personnel

Experiment: Same subject observes empty picture frame (hung on wooden wall) for one (1) full minute.

Results: No faces appear on wood. Subject experiences no effects.

Subject: One (1) D-class personnel

Experiment: Same subject observes picture frame, now containing Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night" for one (1) full minute.

Results: No faces appear on wood. Subject experiences no effects.

Note: The effects seem to be triggered only when the frame contains the original print. SCP-591 appears to be aware of what parts of the surface it is attached to are visible to observers. Manufactured wood material (such as particle board) seems to "confuse" it.
