It possesses a neck around 26 meters long which is connected to a 'Venus fly-trap' like head around 2 meters in length and width. SCP-2091 has the ability to grow multiple tentacle-like appendages from its body extremely quickly, each of these tentacles are laced with long sharp rose thorns. SCP-2091 will attempt to consume all life it comes across, no matter what physical state it is in. SCP-2091's normally catches prey by either picking it up with its tentacles and dropping the prey down its throat, or by going limp and luring the prey into its mouth with a pod inside its mouth which releases spores. These spores have a certain 'hypnotic' quality and those who inhale feel compelled to go to the source.

SCP-2091 is fully sentient and reacts to sounds and smells. SCP-2091 can be subdued by any form of physical damage or any strong alkaline. Alkali have to be between 10 and 12 on the PH scale to have any effect on SCP-2091. SCP-2091 was located by MTF Delta-3 "Pack-Hunters" on [DATA REDACTED] at the [DATA REDACTED] farm in [DATA REDACTED].

Addendum: SCP-2091's alias was given when Dr. Vanheron noticed SCP-2091's similarities to John Wyndham's fictional monsters.
