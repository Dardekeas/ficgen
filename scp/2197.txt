Description: SCP-2197 is a black arcade cabinet. However, according to some of the tests run on it and looking inside of it, it was found to be not a game but an otherworldly device. It's origins are unknown. However, it is extremely deadly. Despite the main components that force people to play it are removed rendering it helpless, we still do not know what it is capable of.
