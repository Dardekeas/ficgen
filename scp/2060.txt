Item #: SCP-2060

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2060 is currently contained within a 25-by-25 meter plot in a greenhouse at Bio Site-103. A 20-by-20 meter barbed wire fence 3 meters tall with a single remote-locked gate is to surround SCP-2060's plot. One guard is to be on duty to ensure that no personnel cross the fence unless permitted to do so by Dr. Pomolson.

An automated irrigation and fertilization system is to maintain SCP-2060. Once per month, all fruits produced by SCP-2060 are to be collected by remote-controlled robots and incinerated. Any instance of SCP-2060-2 produced is to be immediately incapacitated using nonlethal electrical weaponry and given Class B Amnestics, and the instance of SCP-2060-1 in their possession is to be confiscated and incinerated.

Researchers submitting experiments for SCP-2060 must receive permission from two(2) Level 3 researchers.

Mobile Task Force Upsilon-9 "Mandrakes" has been commissioned to investigate all potential occurrences of SCP-2060, SCP-2060-1, and SCP-2060-2 in the wild and terminate all encountered instances immediately using Class-6 incendiary weapons and Class B amnestics.

Description: SCP-2060 is an anomalous instance of the common mango tree (Magnifera indica). It is roughly 32 meters tall, and has a crown radius of 15 meters. SCP-2060 itself has most of the properties of a regular mango tree, and only four anomalous properties: its crown is larger than a normal mango tree; it is able to grow in most climates and soil, even those harmful to normal mango trees; it flowers all year round; and the majority of its flowering branches grow only 1.5 meters, on average, above the ground. However, the primary anomalous property of SCP-2060 lies in its fruits (hereby designated SCP-2060-1). Although SCP-2060-1 appear to be unripened Indian mangoes, when a human comes within 0.5 meters of an instance of SCP-2060-1, they perceive it as a valuable object. Animals are unaffected by SCP-2060-1 and can eat the fruit with no ill effects.

Affected humans (hereby designated SCP-2060-2) will collect this instance and try to use it as legal tender. However, this effect is limited only to the initial collector of said instance of SCP-2060-1. All other humans will be unaffected, even within the 1-meter radius. Should SCP-2060-1 be accepted, the acceptor will be converted to an instance of SCP-2060-2, while the original instance of SCP-2060-2 will then return to SCP-2060 and collect another instance of SCP-2060-1, working to convert more persons into SCP-2060-1. As a result, the rate of SCP-2060-1 conversions progresses geometrically. Any and all instances of SCP-2060-2 can be cured by removing the SCP-2060-1 from their possession and treating them with a Class B amnestic.

Should SCP-2060-1 be rejected, SCP-2060-2 will attempt to convince the unaffected person of the monetary and religious value of SCP-2060-1, additionally promising to augment the payment with favors ranging from monetary to sexual. If still unsuccessful, they will use the SCP-2060-1 instance at a different establishment.

As the number of SCP-2060-2 instances increase, they will spend increasing amounts of time around and focus increasing amounts of attention to SCP-2060, to the point of anthropomorphizing it and treating it as an unknown deity referred to as "His Mangoness". If SCP-2060 is removed from its location, instances of SCP-2060-2 will immediately seek to retrieve it through any means possible. SCP-2060-2 instances are no more resistant to injury than normal humans, but will ignore minor injuries. If the host SCP-2060 is returned, all SCP-2060-2 instances will cease hostilities and return to prior activities.

When a certain amount of SCP-2060-2 instances are produced (typically ██ instances), all instances will begin planting the seeds of all SCP-2060-1 in their possession. These SCP-2060-1 seeds grow at accelerated rates, maturing in 4 weeks. However, only one SCP-2060-1 tree will flower, and will be extremely stunted. The SCP-2060-2 instance that planted the flowering SCP-2060 will transplant it to another location, always at least 80 kilometers away- the exact distance is dependent on the transportation available in the general area- and convert more people into SCP-2060-2 instances, while professing complete ignorance of its original group. The previous group of SCP-2060-1 will stop attempts at conversion and live in isolation as a self-contained society, the economy of which is entirely based around mangoes. All subjects will periodically create art focused on SCP-2060, utilizing varied mediums to create works such as movies, oil paintings, rap, body piercings, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Identical copies of certain works have been found in separate outbreaks.

Should two groups of SCP-2060-2 from different SCP-2060 instances come into contact, they will immediately engage in highly aggressive activity against each other, conducting various forms of warfare until one group has been totally exterminated. This effect has been observed even between single members of different SCP-2060 groups.

The Return of the Mango King

An unfinished script for a movie collected from Incidents-2060-█, -█, -██, -██, and -██. Although the play follows a single major plot, individual details, such as the level of technological sophistication, form of government, and currency, are dependent on the setting on the outbreak.

SUMMARY:

The movie opens in the middle of the night as the Mango King sleeps alongside his wife, the Queen. He awakens, hearing a noise, and then is abruptly wrested from his bed and a bag is placed over his head, muffling his cries. The Mango King is quickly carried from his room. His kidnappers avoid the various security guards patrolling the residence and proceed to flee with the Mango King. At the same time, a figure obscured by darkness gets into the bed.

The next morning, the queen awakens. She turns to a figure who appears to be the Mango King, lying next to her in the bed.

Meanwhile, the true Mango King awakens in a decrepit room with a single door. He makes several unsuccessful attempts to escape.

Returning to the queen and false king, they perform various administrative duties. Over the course of the day, it becomes apparent that there are numerous marital issues between the queen and real king. They begin to argue over these issues, which serves to indicate the level of surveillance that the mystery conspirators had placed on the true king before his abduction and replacement. The queen finally leaves in disgust, leaving the false king to relay a message to the conspirators.

Returning to the Mango King, he is awakened from a fitful sleep by a masked conspirator who enters bearing a tray of food and various utensils. The conspirator refuses to speak to the King and leaves. The Mango King quickly consumes the food before returning to sleep. He is abruptly awakened by a sound. Following the sound, he discovers a small crack in the wall. The Mango King retrieves the spoon and makes futile attempts to deepen the orifice.

The script ends there. During Incident-█, a note was collected with the script.

Note collected from Incident-█

I don't know! I don't KNOW! Mangoness damn it, how do I do this? It has to be perfect! It has to reflect His Mangoness' character! I can't do that! What more can I write? This script isn't working! I have all this creative power but it can't hold a candle to His Mangoness. There must be some way. He would not have given me this gift if he did not believe in me. Am I not a true devotee of His Mangoness? He believes in me. I must achieve this task and prove that his trust was not in vain! But how? There is no way I can capture his eloquence, magnanimity, courage, strength, and essence with mere paper! But what can I I know what I can do. May His Mangoness give me the strength to complete this task.

Acquisition Log: SCP-2060 was initially discovered in [REDACTED], following reports of extreme hostilities between two religious groups both claiming to be "His Mangoness' Chosen Ones". Foundation investigation led to SCP-2060. A shrine dedicated to an unknown deity was built around it, and several locals were collecting SCP-2060-1 instances from it. Because SCP-2060's properties were initially unknown, █ agents were infected during first contact. Mobile Task Force Theta-4 "Gardeners" was dispatched to collect it, using an ROV to uproot it and transfer it to a mobile biological containment cell. MTF Theta-4 was then besieged by ███ instances of SCP-2060-2, leading to █ deaths of the task force and the deaths of all instances of SCP-2060-2.

SCP-2060 was moved to Site-103. In the last ██ years, it has grown █ meters and its crown radius has expanded by █ meters.

During the time that SCP-2060 has been in custody, there have been ██ known SCP-2060 outbreaks across the world. Containment of these outbreaks has provided more information on SCP-2060.
