Abandoned buildings are something we automatically learn to ignore, which makes them the perfect cover for someone who doesn't want to draw attention to themselves. Like certain less-than-legal businesses, or the masquerade. Which means that that abandoned building off in the distance, might not be so abandoned after all, it's just kept looking that way to keep out the curious.

Not usually for fight scenes like its close relative abandoned warehouse, generally people want to keep this building intact. Doesn't mean there won't be an underground fight club there though.
