Do you need to get into your house... or perhaps someone else's house... quickly? Have you suddenly realized you locked your keys inside your house, so that now you not only can't get your car started, but you can't get into your house to get your keys? What do you do? Why, you look under the doormat, of course!

Occasionally, the spare key isn't hidden under the doormat, but is rather hidden inside a fake rock, or in a ceramic animal near the door, or even concealed atop the frame of the door itself. There is also a vehicular variant wherein the spare key is hidden above the driver's side sun visor.

Often truth in television, despite the advice of pretty much every crime prevention leaflet.
