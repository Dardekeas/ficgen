In real life, an engineer's job is to design machines or structures that perform a certain task, and perform it efficiently, reliably and safely. It's a challenging job, involving analytical thinking and mathemathics as well as creativity  and last but not least, common sense.

Not so in fiction. When you let a writer of fiction dream up a machine, odds are good that you'll end up with something that is horribly inefficient, unsafe, or just plain impossible.

The reasons for this vary:

 Many writers  Even those writers that pay some attention to functionality often can't be bothered to think things through. Fuel consumption? Maintenance needs? Heat dissipation? They're the last things most writers worry about.

 And then there's failure to think outside the box  that is, failure to consider that there might be If the work is set in modern times, you're supposed to ignore it, but if it is in a sci-fi or fantasy setting, it's a toss-up whether it will be ignored completely, explained as being made of unobtainium or applied phlebotinum of some nature, or only working because a wizard did it or a higher-tech species show us how.

A very frequent cause of awesome, but impractical. cool, but inefficient is a subtrope. Related to no osha compliance, as process safety is a pretty big issue for most engineers in real life.

It's only that tabletop rules forbid doing so that stops anyone from simply shooting the Baneblade in it's Demolisher cannon and destroying it.
