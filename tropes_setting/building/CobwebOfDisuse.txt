A cobweb or two is often used as a sign that something hasn't been used or hasn't moved in a while. This is a standard part of the decor in haunted castles and haunted houses, so much so that white fibrous decorations simulating cobwebs appear in stores every October.

In real life, this is only partially true. A spider only needs a few hours to build a web on something. On the other hand, not regularly removing cobwebs from something will allow dust to build up on them, making them a lot easier to see.

Taken to extremes, this can become a cobweb jungle. Compare bat scare and wallet moths. See also trash of the titans and extremely dusty home.

   Persons sleeping at work or waiting for a long time in any situation are sometimes depicted like this as well.

They would then find spiders and place them in front of the newly built walls so they would build webs and make the walls look older. (In a similar vein, wine merchants would often run a scam against Nazi officials by sprinkling dust on top of bottles of cheap crap to pass it off as old and valuable.)
