A seriously tall building. So tall, in fact, that you probably won't read the caption under this page's image until you're near the bottom of the page.

Common in speculative fiction, these buildings tower over their surroundings, or may be part of a city of similar buildings.

Indeed, it is not uncommon for them to be a single city in their own right.

To qualify as a Starscraper, a building must be clearly over 1,000 metres tall. The tallest building on Earth, the Burj Khalifa in dubai, united arab emirates, is 828 metres tall. For a city entirely made of those, see skyscraper city.

Compare space elevator. When the Starscraper is the home of the villain, it becomes an evil tower of ominousness.
