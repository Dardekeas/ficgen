Good guys hold off an overwhelming enemy threat against impossible odds. The opposite of storming the castle. super trope of the last stand.

Compare with hold the line, naval blockade, protect this house, you shall not pass, and all your base are belong to us. If they fail, see watching troy burn. If they send someone to get the cavalry, it's bring help back.

Also the name of a 1998 film, although the siege in question is not as straightforward as the trope.
