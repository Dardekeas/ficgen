Neon Genesis Evangelion (Shin Seiki Evangelion) is a 26-episode science fiction/action/drama anime series which aired on Japanese television in 1995-96. In 1997, Gainax followed the series with the film Death and Rebirth, a clip show revision of the series which condensed many of the series' episodes into an hour-and-a-half timespan (while also expanding a few scenes). Death and Rebirth also featured the first half-hour of The End of Evangelion, a full-length movie that brought the story to a much more definitive (but by no means less controversial) conclusion than the television series did.In the year 2000, a global cataclysm known as Second Impact changed the entire world. The event annihilated Antarctica (which caused global flooding), shifted the planet's axis (which caused global climate change), led to half Earth's human population dying, and resulted in geopolitical unrest. Fifteen years later, fourteen-year-old Shinji Ikari finds himself summoned to the fortress city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father, Gendou, for a single purpose: to pilot a humongous mecha called an Evangelion and battle physics-defying beings known as Angels, which threaten to destroy what remains of humanity (though the show does not explain exactly how they plan to do so, and for what reason, until much later).What starts off as a relatively standard humongous mecha premise, over the course of the series, gradually transforms into a dramatic character study rife with psychological analysis, religious references, genre deconstruction, social commentary, and exploration of themes such as societal alienation, depression, and the repressive pain of human subjectivity. Prior to Evangelion, people considered this approach unprecedented and revolutionary â€” and after Evangelion's runaway success, numerous other anime producers created shows with a similar approach (with varying degrees of success).Evangelion defined the career of Hideaki Anno, whose personal battles with depression at the time of its creation directly inspired many of the show's themes. Anno has since come to fully own it, even as it's spun off into numerous extra adaptations which either play on the themes of the anime or ignore them to varying degrees. See the franchise page for details on those.Plans for a live-action adaptation were announced by weta back in May 21, 2003. However outside of concept art, the film has since been languishing in development hell. Fans have noted that the movie Pacific Rim is a spiritual licensee of the series (albeit one with less focus on drama), and may be the closest thing to a live-action adaptation that the series could receive. A crossover with the Transformers franchise has also been teased.An episode guide has recently been finished.Compare Brain Powerd, Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor, Gasaraki, Guilty Crown and RahXephon for works with a similar tone.Contrast FLCL, GaoGaiGar, and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, each pretty much the polar opposite of Evangelion, the first and last of which are made by the same studio.For similar anime in general, compare Revolutionary Girl Utena, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and Serial Experiments Lain.For other TV shows with a similar theme and narrative, see: The Prisoner.For a similar setting and story in the field of tabletop games, see: Cthulhu Tech.For a similar story and themes in video games, see: Drakengard, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Spec Ops: The Line, Xenogears, and Shadow of the Colossus.
