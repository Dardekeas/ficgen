Who needs an Artillery, Armored, Engineer, Mechanized, or Motorized Brigade when you can have a 100-metre humanoid robot with a glowing sword and a fist that fires off like a missile? There's no argument â€” mecha are just infinitely cooler than ordinary vehicles. And when they're really huge, they're even cooler than that! which is what really matters in the end, right?Mecha themselves usually divided between the "super robot genre" and the "real robot genre", the distinction typically being where they belong on the mohs scale of sci-fi hardness, though there are as many different kinds of settings for mecha as there are genres.

mythology as a whole is also replete with artificial humans and similar automatons (eg. talos, the great bronze automaton built by hephaestus. dr. hell finding an army of humongous mecha in a greek island is, actually, based on that legend), but special mention goes to hindu mythology. One of the three barriers the gods set to protect their elixir, the Amrita, was a robot with rotary saws for hands.

For those of you wanting to create your own Humongous Mecha work, we've got you covered. While not a reality yet or likely to be... Japan is working on it.

See mecha for the more generic, not-necessarily-humongous supertrope.
