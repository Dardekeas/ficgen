A location in a video game that serves as a base of operations. Usually contains anything you need to replenish your Hit Points and the like, save the game, etc. If the player's inventory is capped, this location is likely to have access to an unlimited storage container.

You may not necessarily have it from the start, but it must be easy to access once you have it. You may even be able to decorate it.Often mobile; see cool ship, cool boat and base on wheels. If fixed, it may or may not be a hub level.

Compare hub city.
