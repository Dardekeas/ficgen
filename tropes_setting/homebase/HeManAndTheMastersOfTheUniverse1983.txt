This first animated series for the Masters of the Universe franchise changed the face of children's television when it debuted in 1983. filmation produced the show for daily syndication in conjunction with a pre-existing line of mattel toys and action figures. Its huge success led to dozens of others merchandise-driven cartoons in the 1980s. It is now being rerun on RTV on Saturday mornings and metv on Sunday mornings.Existing in a world that has both futuristic elements alongside sword, legend and lore, the series focuses on Adam, the crown prince of Eternia, who as described in the opening monologue, has the ability to transform into his super-strong barbarian alter ego, He-Man. This transformation sequence also turned Adam's cowardly talking pet Cringer into the brave and fearsome Battle Cat.His primary foe was the evil Skeletor, a warlord who was equal parts wizard and warrior. With the help of a motley crew of heroes, including wise veteran Man-At-Arms, lady of war Teela, and the bumbling comic relief sorcerer Orko, He-Man battles the forces of Skeletor and other evil enemies.Of note is that paul dini was a member of the writing staff (as was j. michael straczynski), and bruce timm did layouts; both would later go on to be main figures in Tiny Toon Adventures and Batman: The Animated Series. (Also of note: Haim Saban and Shuki Levy were involved in the original production of the show as well, also going on to make a surprisingly long-lived children's franchise).The show left syndication and was shown on the usa network, which back then was known for being the "used car" network for its reliance on reruns.There are two further animated adaptations of the franchise, both of which were short-lived.She-Ra: Princess of Power was a spin-off, although it wasn't quite as successful.
