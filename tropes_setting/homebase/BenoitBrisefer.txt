Benoit Brisefer (Steven Strong and Benny Breakiron in English) is a franco belgian comic created by Pierre Culliford a.k.a. peyo (The Smurfs, Johan and Peewit), and drawn with the assistance of François Walthéry (author of Natacha) and scenaristic input from Ivan Delporte.The comic, about the adventures of a young boy with super strength, ran from 1960 to 1978, with increasing schedule slips as time went on due to The Smurfs taking up most of Peyo's time. It was revived from 1993 to 2004 by Peyo's son.Papercutz recently published four books in the series in English — The Red Taxis, Madame Adolphine, The Twelve Trials Of Benny Breakiron, and Uncle Placid.
