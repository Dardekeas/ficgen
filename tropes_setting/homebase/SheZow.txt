SheZow is about 12-year-old Guy Hamdon and his adventures after finding and putting on his deceased Aunt Agnes' super powered ring, inheriting her super hero alter ego, SheZow. Unable to take it off, he must now fight crime whether he wants to or not. In a dress. At least he doesn't have to go it alone, getting help from his best friend, Maz, who acts as his sidekick (with differing alter egos for each episode) while Guy's sister Kelly helps from the "She-lair" with Sheila the Supercomputer. Guy must also keep his identity secret from his policeman father, who has always thought SheZow was an arrogant show-off (due in part to SheZow's popularity; she has comic books and fan clubs!).Despite (or because of) various anti-LGBT groups protesting the premiere (although the show does not address issues of transsexualism or homosexuality,) the show continues to receive high ratings, according to creator Obie-Scott Wade's Twitter account.                                                                                                                                                                 "She-Yeah!"
