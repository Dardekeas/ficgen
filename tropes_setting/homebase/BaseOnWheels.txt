One of the craziest ways a villain can keep their base hidden is to keep it moving constantly around the country. Of course, there's no way your typical elaborate underground base will fit into the average mobile home, (unless it's bigger on the inside than the outside) but rather than compromise and throw away the shark pool, the villain will put his base in an overly large truck or train.

Typically, this vehicle is armour plated and two or three lanes wide, and as a result can just careen straight down the middle of the road/railway ignoring low bridges, other cars and especially the dreaded toll booth — there's almost always a scene of the toll-booth and a few other cars exploding spectacularly as they drive through. The vehicles are also much faster than their real-life equivalents — the lorries that carry fully-furnished buildings can barely make twenty five miles per hour, on straight, clear roads with police escorts. This of course gets even sillier if the villain does not scrimp on the size of his mobile base, resulting in mountain-sized machinery zipping about.

nazi germany had several plans on the drawing board that would have been defictionalizations of this trope. Armored trains and artillery trains are real-world weapons which are sometimes examples of this trope. Armored trains were thought to be obsolete after WWI, but the polish-soviet war proved that they were still viable, and both the Nazis and the Soviets used them in WWII. Artillery trains are about as old as railroading, and remain viable weapons to this day; they were last used in the Croatian War of Independence, during the yugoslav wars.

This trope is for land vehicles only. For bases hidden in boats or flying vehicles, see cool boat, cool airship, and cool spaceship. mercurial base is a subtrope dealing with bases on extremely hot planets. military mashup machine often overlaps with this, since a base on wheels is just a turret or three away from being a land battleship.
