De Kiekeboes is the most successful Flemish comic strip since Suske en Wiske. Though Suske en Wiske has more success and thus larger sales globally, De Kiekeboes are far more popular in Flanders today. Author Merho started his career as a protégé of Suske en Wiske author Willy Vandersteen, but since 1977 he started his own comic strip: Kiekeboe (since 2010 renamed as De Kiekeboes).At first sight De Kiekeboes is your typical Flemish family strip in the tradition of  and Nero. All stories center around the family Kiekeboe: father Marcel, mother Charlotte, teenage daughter Fanny and school boy Konstantinopel. However, the series have a more realistic every day life setting avoiding many of the typical comic book strip clichés: no world's strongest man, no absent-minded professor, no talking animal and fantasy elements are kept to a minimum. We do know that ghosts exist (Spoken in Huis), vampires (Het Witte Bloed, De Kus van Mona, De Babyvampier...), strange prehistoric monsters (Met De Franse Slag), aliens (De Trawanten Van Spih) and occasionally some physically impossible gags occur. But most of the time everything is set in a realistic atmosphere. Fanny and Konstantinopel are not conveniently an orphan or adopted, but Marcel and Charlotte's real children. The early albums are still a bit naïve and childish like a traditional comic strip, but gradually the series started growing the beard and became darker and edgier. Many of the early one-dimensional characters became more complex. Story lines touched more adult and often risqué subject matter like prostitution, drugs, transsexuality, religious cults, racism, homosexuality, ... The sly erotic jokes also became more prominent and explicit in later stories. Today De Kiekeboes is mostly an adult strip, though it still manages to keep its stories amusing and interesting for children as well.The main characters are:                       One of De Kiekeboes most notorious trademarks are the puns and word play jokes, usually hidden in album titles, background gags, throwaway jokes and characters' names.
