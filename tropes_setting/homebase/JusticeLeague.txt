The super team.Composed (usually) of the heavy hitters of the dcu, the Justice League has been around in one form or another since the silver age of comic books, and doesn't show any sign of going away. The team debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 (February-March, 1960), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky. Their appearances in three consecutive issues of The Brave and the Bold served as a trial run. The concept sold well and the team graduated to its first eponymous title by October, 1960.The original lineup is superman, batman, wonder woman, green lantern, the flash, aquaman, and the martian manhunter (commonly known as the "Magnificent Seven" or just the "big seven", and considered the greatest heroes on Earth by pretty much the entire superhero community). Which almost immediately (6 issues later) started to gradually expand to include green arrow, the atom, hawkman, black canary, the phantom stranger, elongated man, red tornado, hawkgirl, zatanna and, finally, firestorm. After that, the group has repeatedly disassembled and reassembled, sometimes with drastic membership changes, including a revival of the original seven. Basically, every dc comics superhero who didn't belong to another team (and a few who did) was a member at one time or another (and even an entire team of non-dc superheroes!). And as the premier group of heroes in the DCU, when a cosmic crisis threatens, every superhero available becomes a temporary member of the JLA, such is the importance of the group.After mark waid and grant morrison's revival, the originals are considered the "Big Seven", and cover the archetypes any superhero team should possess (classical superhero, dark vigilante, fantasy/mythological being, speedster, elemental hero, cosmic hero, psychic).Originally, they were the local crime-fighting club, composed of the best of the best. They were effectively a "social club" for superheroes, where they could hang out with similar people (when not fighting evil). There was no set leader, though certain heroes (such as Superman, Batman or the Martian Manhunter) often ended up taking leadership roles due to their popularity and skill. New members were chosen by voting, which might explain why several heroes that felt rather redundant were added to the roster. They had a series of special bases over the years, most notably a satellite headquarters in orbit above the Earth.In the 80's, DC's editorial team noticed that they were being outsold by the Teen Titans and the x-men, more action-oriented, character-driven teams. So, suddenly, Aquaman gave a big speech about how the team couldn't depend on heroes who were too busy to show up all the time, and reformed the team with a bunch of second-stringers and a few new characters. They operated out of a warehouse in Detroit (for which they got the fan nickname "Justice League Detroit"). For this reason they were a little ineffectual during Crisis on Infinite Earths.As a result of this, the team was retooled again in the '80s, becoming Justice League International (taking over the global guardians' role, and adding in some of the latter group's members) which then split into Justice League America and Justice League Europe, which later (after their membership grew huge) further split into the Justice League Task Force (a "superhero school" led by the Martian Manhunter), and extreme justice, which was led by the more proactive Captain Atom.This approach fizzled after a few years, so DC took the team back to basics by reuniting the original Big Seven and giving them a lunar Watchtower base. The series was relaunched as JLA by grant morrison, who emphasized the team's role as the "gods" of the DCU, and had them only go up against the sort of tremendous, cosmic-level threats which befitted that stature. This new approach was such a hit that for several years pretty much all major events in the DCU revolved around the League, and countless miniseries and one-shots were spun off the new title. After Morrison left, succeeding writers (most notably Mark Waid) continued his approach.The team has a long tradition of crossovers with the justice society of america. Once labelled "Crisis on (Something)" fairly often; commonly takes place at a christmas/thanksgiving dinner attended by both teams, when suddenly a villain attacks. This stopped happening regularly around 1986 with Crisis on Infinite Earths, though the tradition has popped up sporadically since then (1998's "Crisis Times Five", 2002's JSA/JLA: Virtue and Vice, 2007's "The Lightning Saga").A film adaptation is in development for the dc cinematic universe, with a projected release date of 2017.                    DC even has a funny animal counterpart of the Justice League: the "just'a lotta animals" of earth-c-minus, a parallel Earth that's a funny-animal counterpart of the mainstream DCU. The core roster of the "JLA" consists of: Super-Squirrel (a squirrel, counterpart of Superman) The Batmouse (a mouse, counterpart of Batman) Wonder Wabbit (a rabbit, counterpart of Wonder Woman) Green Lambkin (a male sheep, counterpart of the Silver Age Green Lantern) The Crash (a turtle, counterpart of the Silver Age Flash) Aquaduck (a duck, counterpart of Aquaman)Other members included: Hawkmoose; Green Sparrow; Stacked Canary; the Martian Anteater; the Item (the Atom; an elephant); Zap-Panda (Zatanna); and Elongator (the Elongated Man; an alligator).
