Want a big spectacular finale? Want to build a new set? Why not solve both your problems at the same time and trash the set?

Even animators are tempted to do this if the background is elaborate enough. May lead to a rebuilt set.

Not to be confused with die, chair! die! or tantrum throwing. Related to proscenium reveal and on a soundstage all along (please make sure your examples relating to breaking the fourth wall in this way are on those tropepages).
