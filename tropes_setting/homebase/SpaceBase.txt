A supervillain lair â€” in space! For total isolation from those pesky heroes, spy organizations, and other do-gooders, there's nothing better than your very own space station. Tailor-built for the villain with a bottomless budget, the space base often doubles as a kill sat, wave motion gun, or some other doomsday device that can wipe cities (or even entire planets) off the map unless the governments of the world pay a hefty ransom.

A variation on the theme is the moon base; it's within blasting distance of the earth, and there's a lot of prime real estate just waiting for the evil mastermind to snap up.

See space station for the less elaborate and villainous variant of this trope.

Compare elaborate underground base, underwater base, and island base.
