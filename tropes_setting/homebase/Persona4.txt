Persona 4 is an urban fantasy role-playing game spinoff of the popular Shin Megami Tensei jrpg franchise, made by atlus.You are an ordinary high-school student moving to the rural town of Inaba for one year while your parents are abroad. Soon after you settle into your new home with your uncle and young cousin, a series of impossible murders begins to rock the sleepy town: victims who suddenly disappear, only for their bodies to be found hanging upside down from telephone poles with no obvious cause of death.Meanwhile, you decide to check out a new urban rumour called the "Midnight Channel": supposedly, if you stare into the screen of a switched-off television set at midnight when it is raining, an image will appear that shows your soulmate. When you do so, you discover a strange otherworld on the other side of the television screen, shrouded in a perpetual, oppressive fog.Someone or something is kidnapping innocent people and throwing them into this otherworld, where the monstrous shadows that inhabit it will eventually kill them. Using a mysterious inner power called "Persona", you and your friends form an investigation team to rescue the kidnap victims before they are killed, and solve the mystery of who is responsible.Persona 4 takes place in the same universe as all the other Persona games, and begins almost exactly a year after the events of The Answer in Persona 3:FES. The game runs off the Persona 3 engine and even on the same console, but with some upgrades to the graphics and different game mechanics. Most of the Persona 3's main features return, including the popular Social Links and the calendar day system - just as in Persona 3, the game takes place within an entire school year.One major difference is that instead of the player climbing one long tower for much of the game's combat, the player instead enters the TV World and has access to multiple dungeons that unlock as the story progresses. Plotwise, the setting is rural versus the urban setting of Persona 3, which creates an entirely different feeling and plays against the game's main themes. Notably, some of the sexual overtones present in earlier Persona titles have returned in this one.The game has spawned a plethora of related works, including:         Persona 4 is considered by many to be one of the best jrpgs in recent memory, has won universal acclaim and many awards, and deftly followed up on the spur of interest caused by Persona 3 and cemented the SMT franchise's place in the Western gaming mainstream at last.
