Considered to be the granddaddy of the super robot genre, Mazinger Z is the first entry of the Mazinger trilogy. The first manga version was serialized in  from October 1972 to August 1973, and it later continued in Kodansha TV Magazine from October 1973 to September 1974. In December 1972, the anime version premiered on Fuji Television. The TV series ended September 1, 1974. A second manga series was released alongside the TV show, this one drawn by Creator/Gosaku Ota, which started and ended almost at the same time of the TV show.It must be stated that, due to the move from Shonen Jump to Kodansha TV Magazine, there are two different tankobon releases compiling the original go nagai manga. The Sueisha release compiles chapters that are missing in the Kodansha edition and vice versa, and some chapters are not recompilated in any of them. And neither of them has the chapters chronologically arranged. Nonetheless, an Italian publishing house published an "edizione integrale" (comprehensive compilation) several years ago, recompilating ALL chapters and arranging them according to chronological order.Mazinger Z tells the story of young hot-blooded idiot hero Kouji Kabuto, grandson of a genius professor named Juuzou Kabuto. The Professor secretly built a humongous mecha named Mazinger Z, to battle the forces of evil â€” led by his rival gone mad, Dr. Hell. Unfortunately, Juuzou gets assassinated quickly, but he still manages to inform Kouji about his creation. The Professor tells him to take over, but warns him that he could become "a God or a Devil" with its power.Along with his brother Shiro, Kouji takes Mazinger, reaches the Photoatomic Research Institute directed by Juuzou's former right hand man Dr. Gennosuke Yumi, who practically adopts the boy. Eventually he's pitted in a continuous battle against Dr. Hell, presented in a good ol' monster of the week fashion.Mazinger Z was followed by Great Mazinger and UFO Robo Grendizer. However, being a forty-years-old long runner franchise, it has got many sequels, spin-offs and remakes throughout four decades:                  Made by go nagai, who would later inspire the creation of (but not, as common misconceptions would have you believe, actually create) ANOTHER granddaddy of super robot anime: Getter Robo.In the US, Mazinger Z was aired under the title Tranzor Z as a response to the popularity of Voltron. In this dub, Koji became "Tommy" and Sayaka was "Jessica." It was later given a shorter, but more faithful dub run commissioned by toei. The Toei dub was hugely popular in the Philippines before Ferdinand Marcos ordered it off the air, and some episodes were released on VHS in the U.K.; before Tranzor Z, snippets of this dub had been aired in the U.S. on a Christian Broadcasting Network public-affairs program about Japan. And finally, in 2012, it was announced by discotek media that they will be releasing the full, uncut, subtitled 1970s anime series in 2013. The fans went completely insane.Other than in all Super Robot Wars games (before ux, that is), Mazinger Z also appears in several videogames: Mazinger Z, a Beat'-Em-Up for super nintendo entertainment system; Mazinger Z, an arcade Shoot'-Em-Up featuring all robots in the trilogy; Mazin Saga Mutant Fighter, a Beat'-Em-Up for Genesis based on the  manga; and CB Chara Wars, an action game based on the cb chara go nagai world OVA.
