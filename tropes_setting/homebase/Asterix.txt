Astérix is the protagonist of a French comic book series, written by rené goscinny   and drawn by Albert Uderzo (and both written and drawn by uderzo after goscinny's demise in 1977), and now translated into over 100 languages and published around the world. The comics are also commonly referred as Astérix and Obélix.The Astérix comics take place in the year 50 BC. gaius julius caesar has all but conquered continental Europe, except for a few pockets of resistance. One of those pockets of resistance is a small but plucky village in Armorica, Gaul (Brittany, pre-medieval France), which has held back the Romans thanks to a super strength-granting magic potion. The village happens to be the home of our hero, a small but plucky Gaul named Astérix. Along with his loveable lug partner, monolith craftsman Obélix and the other inhabitants of the village, Astérix gets into all manner of adventures, which usually involve foiling the schemes of the Romans (and, occasionally, Caesar himself).The stories are published as "albums" (the term "graphic novel" being newer than the series, which began in 1959) and typically alternate between two themes. In many of the books, Astérix, Obélix and Dogmatix, sometimes accompanying or accompanied by another character, go on an adventure somewhere (these are often have titles of the format Astérix in...). These plots allow for the most satire of different cultures and nationalities. In the second type of plot, a new plan by the Romans or an unexpected threat from outside brings danger and excitement to the village. These plots allow character development of the various villagers and their relationships.Occasionally, a small (and very persistent) band of pirates (a parody of another comic series, Barbe Rouge) makes a cameo appearance; their ship was scuttled by the potion-enhanced Gauls in an early story — since that initial appearance, they are usually seen either paddling frantically away from any Gauls they encounter, or coming across the Gaulish warriors during an incidental encounter and getting scuttled again (or even scuttling their ship themselves to minimize damage).Part of the appeal of the series is probably the variety of humor, which includes slapstick fight scenes, plenty of wordplay, thinly-veiled social commentary, and Iron Age and Roman antiquity versions of just about every European (and beyond) stereotype you can imagine.The series has some of the best translations of any comic-book ever; they're smart enough to keep the basic story while making new puns in the appropriate language.After decades of solo work, Uderzo retired in 2011 and passed writing and art duties to Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad. The latest album was released worldwide in October 2013.Now with a recap page under construction and a separate page for The Twelve Tasks of Asterix animated movie.                                                                                                                                                     Hypocrite: Cleopatra. She chews out Caesar for sabotaging the construction of his palace claiming that he shouldn't cheat...while claiming that she CAN use the Gauls to have the palace built in three months as planned. Never mind that the whole thing was to prove that her country was not decadent as Caesar said,
