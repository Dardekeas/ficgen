Leverage (2008-2012) is a crime dramedy which follows the exploits of Leverage Consulting & Associates, a team of heroic criminals led by a former insurance investigator. The team takes a modern-day robin hood approach of finding people and corporations who have committed wrongs and attempting to restore justice as they see it, using their skills to run elaborate Oceans Eleven-style cons on their targets. Think of them as a modern-day version of Mission: Impossible or The A-Team.The show has finished its fifth and final season after TNT opted not to renew it for a sixth. However, the franchise is being continued through tie-in novels and role-playing games.One of the show creators is john rogers, better known on the Internet as Kung Fu Monkey.
