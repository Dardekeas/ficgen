Voltes V (formally, 超電磁マシーン ボルテスV or Choudenji (Super Electromagnetic) Machine Voltes Five) is the second of Tadao Nagahama's Robot Romance Trilogy of super robot series, premiering in 1977. It was preceded by Combattler V and followed by Daimos. As with its predecessor Combattler V, the "V" is for the combining mecha's five constituents, their five pilots, and the traditional V for Victory.Considerably darker and edgier than Combattler V, Voltes V chronicles the Voltes Team and Camp Big Falcon's defense of Earth from the invading Boazanian Empire, beast fighter by beast fighter, as well as a simmering civil war within planet Boazan itself, long under the brutal caste-system rule of Emperor Zu Zambajil, between the horned elite and the hornless commoners.It may come as a surprise (or not) that yoshiyuki tomino was involved in making this anime.Has a character sheet that needs to be completed.
