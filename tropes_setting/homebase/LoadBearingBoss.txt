A boss-type monster whose destruction causes the location to self-destruct (see collapsing lair). Usually results in a scene after the final battle wherein the player must make a hasty escape before the clock runs out.

Commonly happens with final bosses in rpgs and metroidvanias.

Always seems a bit too contrived, though Terry Pratchett suggested in his first Discworld novel The Colour of Magic that this phenomenon was due to entropy (having been frightened away by the horrifying boss) making up for lost time. Or perhaps the lair simply has no ontological inertia.

Can be justified by some form of dead man switch or, in more fantasy/magical settings, by a literal bit of a wizard did it, in that the power of the big bad is what originally put, and is currently holding, the place together, making his defeat somewhat like shutting off an electromagnet. Not related to load-bearing hero, except in as much as he'll have to hold up the resulting collapsing lair for his friends to escape.

Particularly large-scale examples may be a type of cosmic keystone. reactor boss is a justified subtrope. Compare defeat equals explosion and barrier maiden. When a boss takes some final action to cause this sort of situation, its taking you with me.
