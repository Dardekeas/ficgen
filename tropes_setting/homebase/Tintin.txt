The Adventures of Tintin, originally titled The Adventures of Tintin and Snowy, is a seminal Belgian comic series and has had considerable influence on the development of graphic narratives in Europe and around the world.Briefly, Tintin was invented by Georges Remi (AKA hergé, from his initials backwards, R.G., spelt phonetically in French) as a cartoon character for Le Petit Vingtième, the children's supplement to Le Vingtième Siècle (The Twentieth Century), a conservative, Catholic newspaper in Belgium. The character was developed from Totor, a boy scout character Hergé had previously drawn for Le Boy-Scout Belge. When the German occupation ended the publication of Le Vingtième Siècle, the feature moved to the Brussels daily Le Soir, where it became a daily newspaper strip until the Liberation in 1944. After World War 2 Tintin appeared in the new weekly comic magazine Tintin. The series ran from 1929 to 1976; the incomplete Tintin and Alph-Art was released in 1986 after Hergé's death.Most of the adventures concerned the (eternally) young hero investigating some event or trying to do someone a good turn and, as a result, falling into adventure. The adventures range from thwarting criminals to treasure hunts, from spy stories to a voyage to the moon.the real world frequently impinges upon the stories, with many identifiable events from real life being presented with only a few slight changes of name, for example the grand chapo (real life, gran chaco) war in The Broken Ear, and the sino-japanese war in The Blue Lotus. World War II was hinted at less as Belgium was occupied by the Nazis. In this period, Hergé's stories are fanciful high-adventure yarns with no reference to war at all.The third Indiana Jones film's story was adapted from a Tintin script steven spielberg was writing.
