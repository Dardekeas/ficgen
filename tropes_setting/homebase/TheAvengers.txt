The marvel universe's all-star super-hero team, equivalent to the dcu's justice league of america... except with more B-List heroes originally and a name that is based firmly on the concept of rule of cool (literally, Wasp picked the name because it sounded cool; some adaptations provide better explanations, though). The team debuted in The Avengers #1 in 1963. The classic lineup is captain america, iron man, ant-man, the wasp, thor, and the hulk. The team also within the first few issues gained the series trademark of shifting lineups, with the Hulk leaving the group with issue two, and Captain America not actually joining until issue 4, and with the major change of all the originals save Captain America being replaced by issue 16. Over the years, half of the marvel universe has been a member (to the point that every member of the fantastic four except the Human Torch has been a member at some point), with new members being recruited and old members coming back or leaving as story dictates. Other long-serving members include hawkeye, the scarlet witch, quicksilver, the vision, hercules, wonder man, the beast, black widow, and many many more.The comic has produced a good number of spin-offs and side team books including:                  The team made their television debut in The Marvel Super Heroes, a 1966 animated anthology that brought the comics to life through clip art animation.

Additionally, the two Ultimate Avengers direct-to-dvd animated films were lighter and softer versions of the team, and an origin for the ultimates. A more successful animated series, The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, ran from 2010-2012. The Super Hero Squad Show can be considered a lighter and softer take on the Avengers. Another cartoon, Avengers Assemble, premiered in 2013. An anime adaptation of the franchise called Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers is being produced by toei and airs on Japanese television in 2014.The Avengers are also the core of the marvel cinematic universe, with several members getting their own films, and it usually brings the entire team together in an Avengers movie at the climax of a multi-film story arc. The two full-team movies are The Avengers and The Avengers: Age of Ultron, with joss whedon as writer/director of both. The team's roster in the first film consists of: iron man (robert downey, jr.), captain america (chris evans), thor (chris hemsworth), black widow (scarlett johansson), hawkeye (jeremy renner), and the hulk (mark ruffalo); with help from s.h.i.e.l.d. led by nick fury (samuel l. jackson) and his assistant Maria Hill (cobie smulders). Age of Ultron adds scarlet witch (elizabeth olsen) and quicksilver (aaron johnson) to the team; and several other Avengers heroes and villains appear throughout the franchise.Not to be confused with the British agents dating/Spy Couple series The Avengers.This team's series have included the following tropes:
