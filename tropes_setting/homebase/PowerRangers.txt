Power Rangers is a long-running children's action franchise composed largely of stock footage from its Japanese counterpart, Super Sentai.In 1993, Haim Saban decided to do an American adaptation of the previous year's Super Sentai program, Kyoryu Sentai Zyuranger, after an unsuccessful prior attempts to adapt previous Sentai programs such as Choudenshi Bioman. in a style not dissimilar to carl macek's treatment of Robotech, the action sequences from Zyuranger were intercut with new footage and a new storyline, producing Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, the first entry in the franchise's history.The original story followed the adventures of five "teenagers with attitude", selected by an alien being called Zordon to fight his eternal enemy Rita Repulsa who was recently released from containment. Naturally, she came with her own army of monsters of the week. Zordon gave each teenager a transformation trinket to "morph" into costume as well as powerful humongous mecha shaped like dinosaurs, called "Zords" (obviously, named after Zordon).In the show's fourth season, it would rename itself as Power Rangers Zeo, utilizing the Sentai tradition of using new costumes every year; as the second and third season continued to use the Zyuranger suits, despite Zyuranger no longer being the main source footage.It was not until the seventh season (Power Rangers Lost Galaxy) that they took the final step to replacing the entire cast (both heroes and villains) each year. Henceforth, each season would end with the entire team retiring, and the next season would begin with an unrelated group in a different city with a different set of powers with no direct connection to the previous series. In addition to keeping the show "fresh", this excused the writers to recycle episode plots. ("Red Ranger learns how to be a good leader", for example)The extent to which each Power Rangers incarnation resembles its Super Sentai counterpart varies from season to season. In most cases, the general premise is preserved, but its interpretation is greatly changed - for instance, Lightspeed Rescue added the US-exclusive "Titanium Ranger" to the team since its counterpart, GoGoV did not include a traditional sixth ranger. However, some series have closely followed the plots of their counterparts, even borrowing entire episodes (Time Force, Wild Force, SPD, Samurai). In other cases, the original premise is all but discarded (Lost Galaxy's setting was changed from a lost world-style forest to a space station, and RPM took a goofy parody series with the mecha as robot buddies and turned it into a story set after the end). A main difference with Power Rangers and Super Sentai is the that Power Rangers has one continuity with all series set roughly in the same year it aired (with RPM an alternate universe) while each Super Sentai season is typically treated as its own continuity reboot (barring Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger, which uses nearly all prior Sentai series as backstory in some form).During production of its ninth season (Time Force), the show was acquired by disney as part of a saban entertainment package deal for the purchase of what is now known as the abc family channel and thus Wild Force would be the first season produced under Disney and the last to be produced by MMPR Productions in California. During its eleventh season (Ninja Storm) production moved to New Zealand and Village Roadshow Productions took over production of the show until 2009. As of 2010, Saban has repurchased the series and all rights to it from Disney under a new umbrella venture called saban brands, effectively uncancelling Power Rangers... again.The First Saban Era: 1993-94:  1996:  1997:  1998:  1999:  2000:  2001: The Disney Era: 2002:  2003:  2004:  2005:  2006:  2007:  2008:  2009:  2010: A The Second Saban Era: 2011:  2013:  2015: The franchise spawned three feature films. Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie was a big-budget affair with entirely US-produced footage and extensive CGI, set as a non-serial movie in an alternate continuity to season 3. The second film, Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie had simply better production values than the TV series, and is within the regular continuity, setting up the premise of the Turbo season, but reception was much more negative than the other one.  A third theatrical movie has been announced, with the intention being a truly big budget blockbuster adaptation of the classic MMPR.Now has a tv tropes tumblr account here.
