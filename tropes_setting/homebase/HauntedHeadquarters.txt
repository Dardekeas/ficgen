It's affordable with good access to the city, and has plenty of space. So why is the rent so cheap? And why do they seem willing to give the place away? Something's wrong with it, and no one wants to tell you why. Or maybe it's so obvious no one has to.

The haunted headquarters is a primary setting that leaves the characters with no other choice than to cope with the issues or depart.

Whether it's a ghost or bad location or whatever, the cast gets the idea to live or work here. They may have to help or exorcise the ghosts and fix up the place. In a happier situation, maybe they meet up with whatever problem it has, and after fixing it are offered the place to stay.

The most compromising situation is when the cast basically has to live (or literally cohabitate) with whatever issue the place has if they want to stay. They'll usually get over it, though. (Occasionally, an intelligent ghost will become part of the cast.)

The haunted headquarters may be a haunted castle or haunted house. Expect the haunted house historian to exposit on its history.
