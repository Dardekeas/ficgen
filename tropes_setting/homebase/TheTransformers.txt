With their home world depleted of energy due to the war, the Autobots leave on their ship to find a new planet with energy sources. The Decepticons follow in a ship of their own. The ensuing battle led to them crashing on Earth. Millions of years later (in 1984), both factions wake up, resuming their war on our world.The Transformers was the first Transformers cartoon, part of the Transformers Generation 1 franchise. It premiered in 1984. The writing and distribution of the series was handled by both Marvel Productions and sunbow entertainment. Animation was done by toei animation and a few other (uncredited) studios, including akom in their first project, some Philippines-based studio and several feeder studios. AKOM's animation was generally worse than Toei's.The show ran for three whole seasons, plus season 4, which was just a three-part episode, "The Rebirth". The Japanese version branched off into a different continuity right after the end of the third season, replacing "The Rebirth" with Transformers Headmasters.The continuity of this series provided the basis for Transformers: Wings of Honor.
