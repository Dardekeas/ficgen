America is a large country of stunning diversity, but the film and television industries are largely confined to one little corner of it: southern california, where Hollywood is. Writers tend to write what they know, and since they know Southern California, the rest of the country will often be inaccurately portrayed as being just like L.A. (And it'll look just like l.a., too.) Often, this happens just because it's cheaper to film in nearby locations than to spend money relocating staff to other parts of the country. Because of this, minute details about other locations tend to get written in media as being just like california, even when it's very different. This trope has been especially prominent in American culture since the 1980s, when Los Angeles began to supplant New York City as the "hip" place to be.

This is arguably the reason why it's always spring. Also known as Californication, which is the trope namer for a tv show and a song. Especially as a take that by residents of the pacific northwest. Nonetheless, it can be inverted by having shows that actually are set in Southern California... but filmed in vancouver.

Subtrope of we all live in america, which happens when American media assumes that life and culture in other parts of the world is the same as in the United States. britain is only london, free state amsterdam, thirty seconds over tokyo and the eiffel tower effect occur when a country is deliberately reduced by the writer to its most iconic city or just one landmark. Contrast canada does not exist, a weird Canadian inversion of this trope, and eagleland osmosis, where the omnipresence of American media leads non-Americans to believe that their country works just like America (or L.A., for that matter).

Non-American media is, of course, not exempt of its equivalents. The main difference is that unlike in the United States most media in other countries is often produced in or around the nation's capital.

 The death penalty. Until recently, often sought in California, but rare in practice due to the drawn-out process of appeals. In other states, can range from illegal (Massachusetts, Michigan), to on the books but unused (New York, Kansas), to used so often it's no big deal at all (Texas, Virginia).

 California cops have  Speaking of cops,  The LAPD vehicle livery (black hood, white cabin, black trunk) has also become popular all over the US. Even in places where the nearest major city does something different.  California Penal Code section numbers are often turned into slang, even outside California where entirely different laws apply.

 California is one of nine "community property" states. This has led many people in TV and movies (and real life) to use the term when they mean "marital property".

 While California is far from the only state to use the term "District Attorney" for their prosecutors, many states and the Federal government use different terms. Despite this, no matter where a work is set, a prosecutor is going to be called the District Attorney. You'll rarely hear US Attorney (the federal title), Commonwealth's Attorney, County Attorney, State's Attorney, or any of the other titles.

 Parole is nearly always an option in fiction, unless the crime is especially heinous, in which case it can be taken off the table, like a "life without parole" sentence, just like in California. In reality, sixteen states have no parole system, and neither does the Federal government.

 Carbonated soft drinks are always "soda"  never "pop", "cola", or "coke"  because that's what the generic name for a fizzy drink is in California.  Stories set ostensibly in places such as Ohio or Connecticut have characters wearing tee-shirts and other  In Southern California, highway numbers take the definite article: Interstate 5, for instance, is "the 5"; state highway 22 is "the 22", and so on. Despite this tic being pretty much unique to Southern California, it is often carried over into shows and films even when people in the setting would say "Route 22", "State 22", "I-5", "Highway 5", just plain "5", and so forth.

 In one episode of  The state government office that deals with motor vehicle registration, driver's licenses, and personal identification is invariably called the Department of Motor Vehicles, or "the DMV." Most states have this department, but only 18 call it the DMV. The other 32 might change the name slightly, such as Arizona's Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) or Ohio's Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV). Others have a name completely different like the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Still others give this task to government offices not normally associated with vehicles or ID. For example, Illinois handles these tasks via local offices of the Secretary of State. Nonetheless, "the DMV" has become shorthand for this office all across the country.

  In-N-Out Burger  This fast food chain has the  California-specific namings of stores with different names across the country: Ralph's (supermarket chain owned by Kroger), Checkers (known in some places as Rally's), and Carl's Jr. (known as Hardee's in some places; mostly the South and Midwest).

 An hilariously odd sort of SoCalization appears in the  Radio and TV stations sometimes have  For years, the opening credits of  The cities and terrain in  Five-card draw poker as the gambling game of choice (at least until  In many 80's/90's teen movies that don't take place in California, the "popular girls" have stereotypical   An inversion: While Los Angeles and  Public school architecture. Instead of a single large school building, most California schools use a "campus" design with several structures (often single story) surrounding a courtyard, to take advantage of the generally good weather during the autumn and winter months  In Canada, it's called "We All Live in Ontario'''". Due to the concentration of media in Toronto in an otherwise enormous country, pretty much anything of a "national" nature in English Canada is "Ontario". This includes terminology, accents, products and stores, etc.  In Sweden, it's called "We All Live in Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö." And sometimes not even the last two are counted. The country has a population of 9 million, with over two million living in these cities. For comparison, there are only eight cities in Sweden with a population of over 100,000. Now, consider that most entertainment advertised, and lots of the brands as well can't be found in the smaller communities, and that going to a major city can take hours if not days...

 For the Netherlands, it often becomes "We all live in Amsterdam". Especially common among tourists. Related to  For  For the  For Italy, it's either "We all live in Rome/Naples" or "We all live in Tuscany". Italy has 60 million people and less than 3 millions live in either Rome or Naples. While most of the peninsula is Mediterranean in nature, lots of cities are located far from the sea and warm weather. And let's not mention how every single region is quite different from the others in culture and traditions.

 In Russian internet, Moscow is often jokingly called "Default city" (in English) for exactly that. Everything outside Moscow is known as "Замкадье" ("Transmkadia"), referring to the MKAD highway encircling Moscow.

 Apparently, in Australia, we all live in Sydney, or to a lesser extent Melbourne. Other cities? What other cities?

 In general, any television show showing "modern Britain" will focus on either " It seems that all Germans are from Bayern (Bavaria), as almost every stereotype someone could possibly have about us is based on the Bavarian culture and are not part of the average-German. Lederhosen, anyone?

 In  In Finland, it's "We all live in Helsinki". One guy critiziced the trope by saying that 4 of 5 Finns don't live in Helsinki, Espoo, or Vantaa, but almost every TV show takes place in there.

 Downplayed in France. While most TV series take place in large cities such as Paris and Marseille and 1 of 7 French people live in the Île-de-France region (composed of Paris and all its suburbs), several large companies and a fair share of movies and cultural events put less known towns in the spotlight. Furthermore, French cuisine hailing from every part of the country, you can be sure that some people will know about towns such as  In Brazil, it's "We all live in Rio de Janeiro". It creates an awkward feeling when people are visiting Brazil in other places other than Rio de Janeiro, where Carnaval is not a big thing or extremely different from the image foreign people have of Carnaval, Samba is not present when it is only common to the City of Rio de Janeiro, Football is not widespread to places like the North Region, the lush tropical climate and vegetation where in the central Northeast Region it is semi-arid and in the South Region it is highlands subtropical/temperate, tan-skinned people where in the South Region they are pale and many others. The main reason is that Rio de Janeiro produces most of Brazil's TV and movies.

 Nearly every TV series produced in Spain will take place in Madrid, unless it has a pre-defined premise/plotline that calls for a different setting in particular like in crime/mystery and historical dramas. In sitcoms, it's common to start with a  And, of course, in Japan,
