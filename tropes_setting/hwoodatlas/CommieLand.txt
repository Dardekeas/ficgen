Countries, sometimes fictitious, ruled by communist regimes. As a rule of thumb, these tend to be what happens to ruritania when people's republic of tyranny is installed there.

These places are often pretty depressing, dominated by dilapidated concrete architecture, people wearing drab Commie clothing and probably even the weather cold and rainy (unless it's some place like Cuba, when this trope meets banana republic). Basic utilities are substandard, there are shortages of almost everything (but the news service is all too happy to inform that a local foundry has just cast its 500,000th ton of raw steel) and what little consumer goods are produced are absolute rubbish, especially the cars. However, a foreigner will be glad to find out his spare change is quite a sum in local currency. Locals, besides the clothing, tend to be the eeyore or apathetic citizens, with possibly the only exception being gallows humour (often of russian reversal variety). Which means it's no wonder they tend to be very keen on alcohol. talking is a free action doesn't apply (in the literal sense) here. on the up side, there's always someone caring for you, and frequent public festivities. You can as well expect secret weapons facilities (especially in the biological field of WMD).

After the great politics mess-up, Commieland usually returns to its ruritanian heritage, essentially mixing the worst aspects of the old and the new and becoming a place of rampant crime and predatory capitalism (see the new russia).

Compare and contrast eagleland, ruritania and banana republic.
