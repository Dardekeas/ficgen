A Bulungi is a fictional little country nestled somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. If used as a setting, almost always a thick jungle or parched savannah, even though the southern region is more temperate.

Bulungis are often populated by a mix of white and black residents, the former of whom usually speak with vaguely British and/or Afrikaner accents. The country's name is usually composed of simple syllables that are stereotypically "African"-sounding.

In many cases, the Bulungi is in the midst of the transition process from its former sort of government to a more democratic type of rule, though this might not be going well for them. If there is a dictator, expect him to be a well educated man who majored in western hypocrisy. Depending upon how it is handled, a Bulungi can easily lend itself to unfortunate implications.

Compare and contrast with ruritania, qurac, wutai, banana republic, and darkest africa.
