The village/country/continent in a medieval european fantasy world which has inexplicably (and suspiciously) fashioned itself off jidai geki. Filled with ninja and/or samurai, this is where katanas, oni, kitsune, pagodas and sushi all pour out into the rest of the world.

These places are frequently a mashup of various japanese eras, maybe flavored with a little bit of China, and — in a nod to real history — are usually xenophobic. The background music will be stereotypical Asian instruments, if not a public domain tune.

This can perhaps be attributed to the fact that most console RPG publishers are Japanese. However, such a place may not stand out so much if the setting includes other non-European Fantasy Counterpart Cultures. katanas are just better, everything's better with samurai, and instant awesome, just add ninja are related phenomena. See also jidai geki and far east.
