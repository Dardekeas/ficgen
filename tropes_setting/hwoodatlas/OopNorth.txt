Northern England. To those of the metropolitan southeast in particular, a strange and alien place full of salt-of-the-earth lower-class types who talk funny, notable only for football, pop music and flat caps. To some Londoners, this is anywhere north of the M25, the motorway surrounding Greater London, forgetting about the midlands. Geographically, the North is usually classed as Cheshire, greater manchester, Yorkshire, merseyside, Lancashire, durham, tyne & wear, northumberland, Cumbria and parts of Lincolnshire and Derbyshire.

It's less crowded than southern England, but not half as rich or full of TV bosses. The media sometimes portray a stereotypical place of urban deprivation, coal mines and men in flat caps. Expect stories about working-class struggle, unemployment, crime, alcoholism, and old men having humorous adventures. There may well be trouble at t'mill. The setting of many a kitchen sink drama.

Northerners are sometimes held in the same low regard as Australians and Texans for being too loud, proud and generally insufferable, like in At Last The 1948 Show's four yorkshiremen sketch. But surveys have shown that Northern accents (particularly Yorkshire) are thought to be the most "trustworthy", thanks to the no-nonsense stereotype. Unlike america's conservative deep south, the North of England is generally more left-wing than the South of England is.

The trope name reflects a northern pronunciation of "up North" in the phrase is "Ee, it's grim oop north". While living Oop North is certainly no joke, it should not be confused with the grim up north.

A lot of English-made stories are set in the North, but Americans seldom get the distinction because britain is only london. (London and The North are also as close together as New York and Boston.) Liverpool is an exception for being the hometown of the beatles.

not to be confused with the American counterpart, ap nort'.
