A sort of generic northern blend of norway, iceland, greenland, sweden, denmark and finland.  everyone is liberal, blond and absolutely gorgeous. The streets are clean, the people are intelligent and creative, it always snows, they have Ikea and saunas, and the area pumps out an amazing amount of hot foreign exchange students (both male and female) with cute accents to tempt American high school students. The chances of meeting a pair of beautiful, buxom, blonde twins who won't rule out a twincestuous threesome with any given tourist is uncannily high. Everything is ridiculously expensive by the standards of anywhere else (including the rest of Europe), but that's OK, because higher education is free and so is healthcare.

Everyone either skis or snowboards, and eats a lot of chocolate. About the only other thing anyone remembers is that lego was invented there.

On the rare occasions when negative stereotypes of Scandinavians are shown, the stereotype of choice is to portray them as painfully naive. Finns (who, by the way, are not genuinely Scandinavian, but more of a North Eurasian (Uralic) people related to Scandinavians, but also the SÃ¡mi (= the "Lapps"), the estonians and the hungarians) are known to be violent when their berserk button is pressed.

Technically Icelanders are not "Scandinavian" either, as the strict definition of Scandinavia is only Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The preferred term is "Nordic" which also includes Greenland, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands. Icelanders and Faroe Islanders speak Scandinavian (AKA North Germanic) languages, however.

Going back a little farther in time, one might have seen the region crawling with valkyries, vikings and trolls.

Named for a certain port of , which in turn is a reference to a hitchcock film.
