The fabled lost utopia (or dystopia), often described as sinking due to man's hubris and descent into decadence. A common setting with many interpretations, and some times just generally used as a stock setting for fantasy and speculative fiction stories. Generally it's an advanced ancient acropolis chock full of functional magic, and/or lost technology. Aliens or google earth may also come into play.

A story setting or legendary place doesn't necessarily have to be Atlantis per se to tap into the myth fabric, but it can be any sort of lost civilization that had great achievements and then were mysteriously lost. Other examples include Mu (Pacific Ocean), Lemuria (Indian Ocean) or Thule (Arctic Ocean) ... heck, even "Antediluvia" (literally, "Land Before The Deluge"), in Christian settings. Often the capital city of the precursors/advanced ancient humans.

Due to the connection with the city being an island that sunk, mermaids are often connected to it. Such as the people of the city surviving by learning to breathe water really quick in the underwater ruins, even rebuilding them into an underwater city.

Historically, "Atlantis" draws on ancient myths from various cultures, but the main details are drawn from Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias, where it is a sort of thought experiment related to his visions of the ideal society. In this original version it was an all-conquering empire only successfully resisted by his ideal Athens, which was destroyed in the same cataclysm.

One of the original islands of mystery.

unfortunately, if it's under the sea, it will be less interesting than it sounds.If you're looking for the BBC series, it's here. If you're looking for the 1993 Danish musical, it's here.
