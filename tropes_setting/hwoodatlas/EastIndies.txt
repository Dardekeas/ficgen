Generally portrayed as that chain of islands, roughly a dozen large and a gazillion smaller ones, between the far east and the land downunder, Indonesia is a country that works as a more exotic version of india because not too much is known about it in the english/us-centered part of the world; as it was a Dutch colony until 1948 it's way better known there. Want a story with modern day cannibals? Exotic rites with components of magic? Delicious, but mouth- and ass-burning cuisine? Set it in Indonesia. Sea monsters, modern day pirates, volcanoes, and more can all be found in this tropical island chain. One thing is for certain â€” the area is lousy with tigers and treasure. Oh, and Komodo dragons.

Expect half of the local wildlife to inexplicably be african or south american in origin, and to encounter cannibals and cargo cults.

Compare holiday in cambodia, which is a little further north, and skipping Malaysia and Singapore.
