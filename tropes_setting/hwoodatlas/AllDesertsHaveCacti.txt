The hero and his comic-relief sidekick are trudging across the burning sands, looking for water or shelter, and they walk past a towering saguaro cactus. The problem is, they're marching through the deserts of Arabia...

In fiction, most deserts have cacti, usually the classic two-armed saguaro, though barrel and beavertail cacti are also popular. But the Sahara only has bushes, dunes and bare rock - cacti are only native to the Americas. And despite its common depiction as the ubiquitous cactus, the saguaro only grows in the Sonoran desert, which covers mostly parts of Southern Arizona, Northern Mexico, and a tiny bit of southern California. It does not include any part of Texas, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, or even Northern Arizona.

The entire family of Cactaceae is exclusive to the Americas in its native range — yes, even in high-altitude and colder areas. You'll only see them elsewhere if they're invasive or purposely cultivated for their fruit or decoration. Of course, the range of cactus species available in fantasy worlds is up for grabs, but seeing them in the wild outside the western hemisphere is right out.

If you want to establish that you're in a hot desert, there's no better way than to throw in a cactus. Increasingly, this trope is used to justify a intoxication ensues or a mushroom samba; while many have heard of Peyote, few realize that it is a cactus - at least until someone on television is trapped in the desert, dying of thirst, and remembers that cacti are full of water... and knowing is half the battle.

An alternative stereotype is that all deserts are nothing but hot, sandy wastelands—aside from the cacti—completely disregarding the fact that all deserts except Antarctica have vibrant ecosystems with their own unique animal and plant life. While cacti are the most well-known, you also have Aloes, for example, which are native to Southern Africa and parts of Arabia and Agaves which were native to Mexico but may now be found across the world. The bit about sand is also exaggerated, as many deserts, including where cacti grow native, are rocky rather than sandy. Additionally, a desert isn't always hot  it's less about heat and more about extremes. Desert landscapes have a tendency to fluctuate in temperature, meaning that someone traveling through the desert could potentially have to worry about heatstroke and hypothermia within the same 24-hour period.

Probably a result of either artistic license - geography or california doubling due to lacking the budget to film on location elsewhere.

A subtrope of misplaced vegetation.
