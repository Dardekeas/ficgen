Looking for a weapon out of legend? The headquarters of an ancient tradition? An interdimensional portal? relics of a lost civilization? The ancient astronauts' spaceship? a site of untold mystic power? If they're not in the writer's capital city or hometown, they'll be here, at a Landmark of Lore.

These are the places where people are almost eager to believe almost anything could be found, so many tales swirl around them. Mostly they are either places rich in history, which have been the centre of stories for centuries, or places remote enough that the audience knows little about them.

Sometimes these locations will be turned into a weaponized landmark. Compare ruins for ruins' sake and temple of doom, which may overlap. Probably the result of small reference pools and as such is the Sister Trope to public domain artifact. A Landmark of Lore is often the subject of alternate landmark history.
