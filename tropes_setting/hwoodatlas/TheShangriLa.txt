The Himalayas and other far east mountain ranges are positively packed to the gills with Buddhist villages full of wise monks who will teach weary Western travelers — especially the old mighty whitey — to cast off ego, become one with the universe and attain true enlightenment. Also, to punch through people's heads.

Despite being stuck up in a bunch of cold mountains, Shangri-La (alternatively shangri la) is usually shown as an idyllic and beautiful place, full of rare flora and fauna, and tended by little bald men in orange robes who beat gongs. Alternatively, it may be shown in a more realistic (though no less idealised) light, being cold and uncomfortable to those who are used to Western decadence.

Surrounding Shangri-La is an endless expanse of beautiful but dangerous mountain peaks, none of which feature ski slopes or extreme sports wankers with broken collarbones. Sometimes getting to the village or monastery requires a special Sherpa with secret knowledge, or for the mountaineer to be near death. Other times, it's just a case of turning a corner. Either way, there are definitely no tourists.

Shangri La is almost universally based on Tibet, with the monkish religion a highly watered-down variant of Lamaist Buddhism.

Hiding place for many a utopia. Yet finding it and getting in is usually a lot easier than getting out.

Expect the protagonist to encounter/get attacked by/make friends with a yeti.

Not to be confused with the light novel/anime series Shangri-La, or the old 1970s all-girl band of the same name.
