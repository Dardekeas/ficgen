not a literal land of dragons, mind you. The more modern version of the China half of the far east with the japanese parts sifted out. A country of overpopulated communists.

In Hollywood, there are three types of people who come from China:

 Chinese cooks.

  Rickshaw men.

China itself is portrayed as a mountainous region full of bamboo, a dwindling panda population, rice fields, and elaborate architecture. Being communist, the people are also ridiculously hard workers who move about like ants, scurrying to get projects done via a hive mind. The country is obsessed with New Year's and dragons â€” and there are paintings and statues of dragons everywhere. If you are in a fictional setting with any fantasy aspects, you are certain to run into at least one.

The country is also home to rickshaws, terracotta warriors, and the Great Wall. Any urban area will look like an American "Chinatown". The only important modern people to come out of China are bruce lee and jackie chan. The greatest historical event in China was that thing that happened in Tiananmen Square. It's only later that western film-makers have realised that Mao's Cultural Revolution has been over for more than thirty years, and you don't see millions of people all cycling to work in identical grey suits and caps any more.

In anime, people who come from China are less intelligent, but they know a great deal of kung fu, so you'd better not upset them. If you set foot in the countryside, you're also likely to run into jiang shi who will start hopping around and trying to feast on your blood.

Aspects of Vietnam and Korea are usually still lumped in with China.

For the more modern Western depiction, see china takes over the world.
