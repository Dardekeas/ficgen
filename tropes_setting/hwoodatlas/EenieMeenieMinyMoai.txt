Moai are famous stone statues found on easter island that typically depict a human's head and body and are sometimes seen with a hat called a pukao. For whatever reason, they wind up cropping up in fiction quite a bit. Very frequently their existence or history is treated as a mystery, possibly to be "explained" by some element of the plot, even though in real life their significance and means of construction are known and uncontroversial.

More recently, the island is held up as a warning what civilization may face as the predominately archeological research suggests there was a thriving population, but it was apparently so obsessed with creating the statues that they overtaxed the island's resources and made it uninhabitable with an environmental collapse.

More often than not the fictional equivalent is typically just the extremely large moai head and neck, as opposed to a full-body moai; the most widely-known real-life moai are those of Rano Raraku, which are full-bodied statues buried up to their shoulders or necks in the ground. These moai were the most famous (and impressive) largely because they were the only statues that the Easter Islanders were incapable of knocking over when their civilization collapsed, though many moai have since been re-erected. The pukao (a hat- or topknot-like adornment) is rarely seen, as are the coral eyes many of the statues once possessed. The statues as a whole are far from proportional, with the heads making up a considerable portion of their overall height, which varies considerably from statue to statue.
