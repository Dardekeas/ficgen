People have always wondered about what mysteries might lurk in unexplored regions. At first, it was just the place over the hill. As we explored more, the mysterious unknown was pushed further and further back, until eventually we had the whole of Earth's surface pretty much explored.

The last continent to be explored and mapped out was Antarctica, which was long suspected to exist but ultimately dismissed as myth until 1820, when it was finally, officially sighted by humans. Even now, pretty much its entire surface has only been mapped by satellite. Incredible cold and lethal winds conspired to keep humans away, which made it a fertile area for stories about mysterious buried technology, aliens, and monsters. This trend continues today - after all, who knows what may be under the ice?

As time goes on, of course, science marches on, and the more fantastical versions of this trope are just as discredited as the presence of civilizations on the very definitely inhospitable Mars and Venus as portrayed in many an early planetary romance.
