A sort of odd mishmash of Japan and China (with occasional bits of Korea and Southeast Asia), mixing various stereotypes about "the Orient" together. Expect to see kung-fu or other martial arts, panda bears, chopsticks, lots of bowing, shrines, burning incense, cherry blossoms, paper fans, ninja, dragons, and billowing clothing.

Part of the reason for this may derive from the 19th-century history of East Asia, during which only Japan, China, and Siam (now Thailand) successfully resisted colonization by and loss of national identity to Western (or, in the case of the Koreans and Taiwanese, Japanese) cultural hegemony. For slightly more than two generations, then, most Westerners were familiar only with the Japanese, Chinese, and Siamese cultures.

Has mostly become a discredited trope, and split off into individual tropes for japan and china.

In most console rpgs set in a medieval european fantasy world, there will be one country or town that pretty much defines this trope (or the related subtropes). This occurs often even in games made in Japan (in fact, it seems to be even more prevalent in jrpgs).

Curiously, while many people dislike this sort of mishmash when it comes to Medieval East Asian Fantasy, hardly anyone seems to object to the European equivalent - apparently having celtic druids rubbing shoulders with odin-worshipping high medieval teutonic knights is fine.
