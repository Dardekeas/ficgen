Southeast Asia is a rich land of many cultures and nations. Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, The Phillipines and Indonesia (and singapore and timor leste).

And that's the thing: The West's cultural experience with Southeast Asia is usually limited to the leftovers of the vietnam war. In the minds of many people outside of the region, Southeast Asia (minus Thailand) is a land of steamy jungles, guerrilla warfare, and all sorts of violence and atrocities. Add vice for taste; affairs between American servicemen and native Vietnamese women are notorious, and it's not for nothing that Thailand has a reputation for sex tourism. Furthermore, it appears that Southeast Asia doesn't exist below the sixth parallel - one might get to see the petronas twin towers, but that's about it.

So, when a piece of media goes to Southeast Asia, it usually goes on a Holiday In Cambodia. The setting will either be little jungle villages with wooden huts or cities so seedy they leave marks on the screen. Vice will be both upheld and punished, with the main characters either being told "me love you long time" by a woman (very often a prostitute) who may or may not actually be a biological woman, or being thrown in some hellhole of a prison on drug charges. And someone, some time, is getting a gun in the face. oh, and there may be elephants.For those in the know, it becomes clear that the writers miss saigon.
