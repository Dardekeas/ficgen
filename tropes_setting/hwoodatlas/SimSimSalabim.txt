india has fakirs, rajahs, turbans, snake charmers (and other slightly demented street performers), the Ganges and gandhi. It's also full of temples overgrown with humid jungle and occasionally home to an evil cult, elephants and tigers. snakes are everywhere, so it's a good idea to have a cute and heroic mongoose with you to take them on.

Often, this trope goes hand-in-hand with a case of mistaken nationality, as India, for some reason, suddenly takes on arab and persian characteristics in some American films. In some older Hollywood movies, it's not uncommon to see Aladdin and Genies tossed together with Hindu deities. To be fair, this is truth in television to an extent as India has a large Muslim population (13.4%, according to the other wiki) and was ruled by Islamic kingdoms for century-spanning portions of its history, so it's certainly been more influenced by the Middle East than most Western countries have been. Also, the languages of northern India are mostly Indo-Aryan, making them distantly related to Persian.

Becoming a bit of a discredited trope these days, at least in Europe and North America, where a notable percentage of the population can and will call works set in India out on any inaccuracies.
