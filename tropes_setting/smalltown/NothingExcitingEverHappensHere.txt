Where is the most dangerous place on the planet to live? Not the city where something exciting is always happening. Not mordor. Not a haunted headquarters. Not the crime-ridden big city. Not even tokyo. The most dangerous place to live is the small, quiet, unknown town where "nothing exciting ever happens."

New serial killer on the loose? Bodies are piling up in a small town where nothing like this has ever happened before. Portal to a magical land opening? It's in the big house in the country where you were preparing to spend the most boring summer of your life. Aliens landing? Their UFOs are parked in the middle of a deserted cornfield in a rural town where cattle outnumber people. emo teen moving with their divorced mother out of the big applesauce into the sleepy suburbs? They'll be hiding batman in their basement or starting a mission to save both worlds by the end of the first episode.

How can I turn my own boring, mundane neighborhood into a weirdness magnet, you ask? Just say the magic words "Nothing Exciting Ever Happens Here," and let tempting fate do its work. be careful what you wish for (after all, you don't know what genre you're in) and don't say we didn't warn you!

Compare aliens in cardiff and everytown, america. Contrast quirky town. See ordinary high-school student for when this happens to a person.

Everyone's going to assume that wherever you live, nothing exciting has ever happened, and if you live in a city that no one has ever heard of, it's because Nothing Exciting Ever Happened There, so no straight real life examples should be mentioned.
