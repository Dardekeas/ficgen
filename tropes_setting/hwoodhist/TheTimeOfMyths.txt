A setting in the ancient past, when gods, demons, and monsters walked the earth. Often blends the mythologies of various cultures together, as the writers see the advantages for storytelling. Those writers are a crafty bunch. Also has the tendency to bring in plenty of anachronisms in terms of technology, culture, and so forth. The literary forerunner for this would be the Hyborian Age of robert e. howard's Conan stories, which mixed and matched milieus from different times and places: this way, Howard could have a series protagonist in a historical context, without worrying about historical inaccuracies.

Naturally, however, the concept of such an age is older than dirt. Much myth and literature was written about a supposed time period in the distant past (i.e. before the iron age) that was chock full of ten-foot-tall warriors and interesting monsters to kill. Contrast advanced ancient acropolis.

Common setting for heroic fantasy. See also sword and sandal. Invariably everything is shrouded in myth.

If we see the end of the age, that's end of an age or the magic goes away. May overlap here there were dragons, lost technology, and pointless doomsday device. See also death of the old gods, which is when a setting's past is described this way.

In medieval europe, the preceding dark ages were considered to be this, with historical rulers, dragons, dwarfs, sometimes gods figuring in countless heroic epics and romances. Asian fiction subverts this trope somewhat, due to the prevalence of ancient records and artifacts and the fact that the culture was humming along in medieval stasis until relatively recently.
