The Romantic movement of the 19th century was a style of art that stirred the emotions, like sadness, joy and nostalgia. Later, some people used that style to put things they favor in an idealized manner, even if such things were already seen as positive.

The subjects of these works could be people, places, events, ideologies or other things. Although these are only occasionally accurate to the facts, they can still make for great stories. If taken too far, on the other hand, they can make their subjects into mary sues or mary suetopias.

Note that this isn't about just trying to make something look good, or make it look exciting. It's about stirring the emotions, not just pumping the adrenaline.

May lead to the pirates who don't do anything if part of the romanticizing requires the people to not do the evil parts of the job.
