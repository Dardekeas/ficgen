Of course, we all know what an historical villain upgrade is: that's when you take an historical-domain character who is generally notable for being not a nice person (or at worst, an opponent of whoever your hero happens to be) and transform them into full-on Hollywood-style villain.

But there are certain characters in history whose actions can't be depicted realistically on, say, a children's TV series. Sometimes not even on adult series.

That's where the historical villain downgrade comes in. You don't need to dwell, for example, on the fact that adolf hitler was responsible for a systematic genocide that resulted in almost twelve million deaths; it is enough for audiences to know that he was a Very Bad Man. Likewise, you might present Emperor caligula as a lech with a god complex. No need to get into the squicky details of his life.

Basically, this trope occurs whenever an historical villain's evil actions are either glossed over or reduced in severity, in order to make them palatable, even as a villain, to mainstream television audiences. Sometimes it's because reality is unrealistic â€” there are a few cases of real people displaying such pantomime levels of evil that if you put it in a movie script, the audience would just roll their eyes at your obvious exaggeration.

Compare lighter and softer, politically correct history. Contrast historical villain upgrade.
