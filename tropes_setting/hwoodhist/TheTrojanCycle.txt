It turns out that the The Iliad and the The Odyssey were not the only epics which pulled together the tales of the Trojan War. In fact, there were eight:        We've lost every one of the above except for Homer's epics. Sorry.But yet we still know of them.

By an incredible stroke of luck, we have a work titled the Chrestomathy by an unknown Proclus, which actually summarizes the events that take place in each epic.Thanks to these sources, we know that the epics covered everything from the marriage of Peleus and Thetis to Odysseus's death.So without further ado, for your perusal, the six lost works of the Trojan Cycle:
