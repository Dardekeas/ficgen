an immigrant's tale is simply the story of an immigrant, an immigrant family, or a refugee coping with life in a new nation. A very common setting is late 19th or early 20th century America, with a heavy emphasis on the american dream, but this applies to any time and country. A recent theme is the plight of illegal aliens and migrant workers from Mexico working in America.

Typically leads to overcoming a language barrier, instances of the funny foreigner, and generational sagas. It also frequently overlaps with the Crime genre.
