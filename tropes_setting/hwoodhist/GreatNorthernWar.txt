The Great Northern War was a series of battles fought to contest the Supremacy of the Swedish Empire in Northern and Central Europe. It originally pitted Russia, Denmark-Norway, Poland-Lithuania and Saxony against sweden. The result was a bloodbath that saw Poland switching sides twice (both cases saw the election of a new king), Russia to modernize under Peter I (aka peter the great) and the death of the Warrior King, charles xii and the empire he built with it.

Three treaties followed the conflict: russia gained Ingria, Estonia and Livonia (essentially the area around St. Petersberg and the 2 modern-day Baltic states of estonia and latvia), as well as some territory in Northern Russia (near modern-day Finland). useful notes/Prussia gained the Swedish Pomerania (in the eastern coasts of modern-day Germany), Hanover (who joined the war in 1715 alongside the British) gained Verden and denmark gained Schwelswig-Holstein (where they hold on to until 1864).
