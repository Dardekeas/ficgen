Robert I (11 July 1274 Â– 7 June 1329), better known as Robert the Bruce, was the first Scottish monarch of the Bruce line. He was a major player in the Scottish Wars of Independence and ultimately lead Scotland to freedom. Today revered in Scotland as their greatest national hero, Robert is something of a folk hero in those parts, representing the Scottish Spirit and bravery, and usually considered a national symbol.

Robert the Bruce first entered the annals of history as a heir of the house of bruce, his grandfather (also named robert) was one of many claimants to the throne of Scotland in the succession crisis that came after King Alexander the Third. The Elder Bruce lost, and John Balliol was crowned King. The Elder Bruce resigned and retired. But it is said his teachings and actions greatly affected the Young Robert, inspiring him to his later actions.

Robert the Bruce then grew up believing the same thing his grandfather believed: The Bruces were the rightful kings of Scotland.

John Balliol's (now King John) reign was brief and fruitless, with the King being mostly bossed around by edward hammer of the scots. Soon a War between the Scots and the English began, and after a short series of conflict, King John abdicated.

Scotland was essentially left kingless, and Edward was the de facto ruler of the country. A series of rebellions sparked the war anew, and Robert the Bruce participated intensively in them as one of the leading generals in the Scottish side (but make no mistake, the man switched sides a lot). After several decades of strife, Robert the Bruce emerged as the sole victor and rightful king of Scotland.

In his rule he secured Scotland's position as a independent nation in the eyes of the English and the world. He later attempted to unify Scotland and Ireland, but his plans did not come into fruition. He died of some unspecified disease not too long thereafter.
