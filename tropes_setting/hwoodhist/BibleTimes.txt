Ya know, the times of that book everyone talks about.

Can overlap with ancient egypt (Genesis and Exodus) and ancient rome (the entire New Testament), but is usually centred around the area of Ancient Israel â€” Jerusalem, especially. Home to staff-wielding doom-croaking prophets, Philistines, miracles, and loads of people in big robes who sit tableau-like around tables or rocks, looking awe-filled and reverent.

There are many biblical events disputed with regards to date or accuracy. Most historians date the Israelite Exodus to 1400 BC (there is no other record for the Exodus other than the Bible, but the official Egyptian records DO list a suddenly smaller Israelite population), and the rest of the Old Testament from 1000 BC to 500 BC. The New Testament had the death of Christ dated around 30 AD. Keep in mind that very few dates are accurate due to the various calendar systems used.
