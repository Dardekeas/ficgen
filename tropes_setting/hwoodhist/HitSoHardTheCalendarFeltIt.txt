It's the end of the world as we know it, and the end of the beginning as well. Either the few remnants of sentient life (we're talking either class 1 or 2 here) are rebuilding, or some reality altering event has taken place which reshapes their entire conception of History. In any case, they see fit to reset the calendar and set civilization's New Beginning as year zero (or year one).

Can also be revealed to have happened in retrospect as a world building trope - the event after which a society dates its calendar tells you something about their culture.

Not to be confused with people being "punched into next week".
