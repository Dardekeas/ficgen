punk punk with organic technology, usually centered around genetic engineering. Expect to see a lot of organic technology, sculpted physiques and petting zoo people walking around... or hopping, swimming, flying, slithering, etc. Many buildings and ships will be grown, and a general womb level aesthetic will usually prevail. Issues examined may include designer babies, what measure is a non-human?, what is human, various aspects of ecology and effects of modified crops/animals/bacteria. And you'll see aesops (particularly green aesops about creating what you can't control), both real and fantastic.

It should be noted that the line between Bio Punk and cyberpunk is very thin, and many cyberpunk stories will contain Bio Punk elements.
