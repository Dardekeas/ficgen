Prehistoria is the trope for video game settings taking place in the lost world or one million bc. cavemen abound chasing nubile savages, while dinosaurs will live in volcanoes or breathe fire and eat anyone who comes too close. Expect a blend of jungle japes and lethal lava land.

Typically features a mix of different prehistoric creatures â€” like mastodons and triceratops living side by side and everything trying to kill you. Expect to kill a lot of stock dinosaurs and/or cavemen. Please ignore the palaeontologist sobbing softly in the corner.

Named after the cave area of Secret of Evermore.
