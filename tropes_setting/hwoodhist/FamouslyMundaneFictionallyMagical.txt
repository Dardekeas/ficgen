A sub-trope of public domain artifact, this is the one where real-life objects of notable historical value (that indisputably exist or existed in real life) are given a magical makeover in a work of fiction. Think of it as the inanimate version of beethoven was an alien spy or a historical object upgrade. Can be related to clap your hands if you believe or weaponized landmark.
