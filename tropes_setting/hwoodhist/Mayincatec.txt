Under hollywood history, all historical North/Central/South American nations are lumped into one exotic and often barbaric people: the Mayincatec, featuring aspects of the Maya, Inca and the Aztecs, plus many others. It's a tossed salad of exciting bits from all their histories, with a topping of myth and fiction. And the dressing is blood.

Generally the Mayincatec are more likely to be the villains than the heroes (unless there are conquistadors around). They are prone to historical villain upgrade. Some alternate history stories have them survive to the modern day, resulting in a modern mayincatec empire.

In real life, the Mayas, Incas, and Aztecs were all different; their actual history is interesting and diverges from the trope quite a bit. However, keep in mind that the trope is frequently also valid in modern Latin America.
