Jidai Geki is a genre of period piece found in japanese media.

These works are set before (or around the beginning of) the meiji restoration when the Shogunate was deposed. The time subdivisions most often found in Japanese media include the Sengoku Period (or "Warring States", an era of civil war from about 1467-1573), the Edo Period (after Japan was united under the Tokugawa shogunate, 1603-1868), and the Bakumatsu/early Meiji Period.

Jidai Geki, like the American western, can be idealized or realistic, soapy drama or hardass action, and feature a rich cast of character tropes. Jidai Geki that emphasize swordplay are often referred to as chanbara, especially the live-action movies, and counted on for lots of hot samurai action (ninja, ronin, and yakuza are also frequent players). Given the fact that there are plenty of Edo-era buildings in Japan still standing, and that Edo-era costumes are dime-a-dozen, that period appeals a lot to japanese tv producers. Compare and contrast the sheer amount of BBC costume dramas set in the Victorian age, or the innumerable Chinese films and series set in the Qing dynasty.

Though it may seem American and European directors have been  borrowing these conventions — sometimes whole plots — for years, Jidai Geki pieces have long borrowed in equal measure from westerns and film noir. Kurosawa himself was known to be a fan of director john ford. george lucas took some inspiration from this cross-pollination while writing Star Wars — guess where he got the word "Jedi".
