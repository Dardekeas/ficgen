A series of six wars encompassing the former yugoslavia from 1991-2001:

     PreÂševo Valley, in Southern Serbia (1999 - 2001): Federal Republic of Yugoslavia vs.  Basically, without somebody to hold it together, Yugoslavia blew to pieces in a spectacular fashion, producing the only big war in Europe since world war ii. The war is often thought of as religious, but has more roots in the whims of politicians twisting and manipulating holy writ to serve their own cynical purposes; as such, the battle lines were drawn in accordance with this masquerade: Serbs, who were Orthodox Christian, received help from the similarly Orthodox Russians; Croats, who were traditionally Catholic, received help from the Western countries; and the Bosniaks, who had converted to Islam during the Ottoman era received help from both the West and fellow Islamic countries. The wars also had an economic edge to them; the two northern republics were the most heavily industrialized, and their inhabitants often accused the government of subsidizing the Serb plurality (Serbs amounted to about 36% of the population; next largest were Croats at about 20%) at their expense, making them the first to bail.

Especially the wars in Croatia and Bosnia saw the term "ethnic cleansing" invented and put to practice, with the united nations generally standing around, powerless to help as the big powers dithered in New York as the entire region just went to shit. It initially started off as a small conflict in Slovenia and eventually grew to a much larger war in Croatia.

The true horrors, however, were showcased in the Bosnian War, which overlapped the Croatian War of Independence, and where the fighting quickly morphed into Bosnian Serbs versus Bosnian Croats versus Bosnian Muslims loyal to Izetbegovic versus Bosnian Muslims loyal to Abdic versus any militia given even a degree of autonomy. While the world was aware of the bloody conflicts going on, the media had a tendency to avoid mentioning WHY the war even started in the first place. As a result, the Western world, unaccustomed to the rivalries in the Balkans, sat around and twiddled their thumbs, basically unable to help or understand these conflicted people. (Yet supplying and selling weapons and supplies to this certain sides in an attempt to tip the balance and bring the war to an early end. And every major power backed at least one side, everything from Jihadists in Bosnia to Croatia having the French and America supply arms.) This, combined with the "us versus them" mentality of the people at war, made for a deadly combination.

Eventually, that war ended via Western intervention, but things got trickier as Albanians in Kosovo decided that it was time to break ties with Serbia. This sparked the third big conflict, the Kosovo War. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia engaged in a ruthless crackdown which the United States used as an excuse to intervene. The war only came to an end after America outright launched a controversial bombing campaign. For several months after that, Albanian extremists proceeded to destroy old Serbian monuments (usually christian churches) and killing non-Albanian population. In 2008. Albanians in Kosovo claimed independence which is only partially recognized by the international community.

                                                              The primary use of the war today is as a source of modern day war criminals, as the Nazi ones are getting too old now. Because of the nature of the mass graves, many a forensic pathologist will have worked there.
