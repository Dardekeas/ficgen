This page covers works set during world war ii.

A number of the works below cover multiple categories and are grouped according to their main setting.

In an era where the only major forms of mass entertainment were radio, theatre and cinema (British television went off for the duration), it is not surprising that a very large number of movies were made during the war. Most of them were patriotic flag-wavers of some form or another, but some of these films (including said flag-wavers) have stood the test of time, such as Casablanca, In Which We Serve and Went the Day Well?.
