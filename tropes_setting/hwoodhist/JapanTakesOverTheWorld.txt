Before the Japanese Economic Crash at the start of the nineties, the U.S. pretty much expected that japan would be their new Overlords in a decade or two. They were seen as hardworking, and proficient in technology and business to the point of being inhuman; it's as if they were an entire country of supernerds. (It was only later we learned about their brand of nerds.)

The U.S. was prepared, oh yes. A large number of movies and shows set twenty minutes into the future or later had the U.S. adopting Yen, or all businesses owned by the Japanese.

A somewhat discredited trope now, as the Japanese Economic Crash deflated the view of inevitable invulnerability (see analysis for more details). On the flip side, however, several given American industries (especially automobile manufacture) have come under Japanese dominance so thoroughly by the end of the first decade of the 21st century as to give credence to at least some of the trope's original inspiration, that of the potential superiorities of classically group-focused Japanese business models to more individualist-minded American ones.

Today, the Western mindset is that china will take over the world. The reason is somewhat simpler: the advantage of sheer numbers, and the economic and industrial power that comes with it, as well as a work ethic that, like Japan, is heavily influenced by confucianism. With this in mind, it is of note that India is gaining on them, and has already begun pulling ahead in numerous high technology races. And the American economy remains the largest in the world, even after the late-2000s "Great Recession."

This is a Western trope, not an anime trope.sub-trope of take over the world. See also americasia, yellow peril, china takes over the world and america takes over the world.

The cyberpunk genre was also, in part, a result of this trope, with Japanese technological dominance often playing an important role in early cyberpunk works.
