The Roman Empire succeeded the roman republic in the first century BC, precisely when being a subject for debate. It is generally thought to coincide with Augustus taking control of Rome and declaring himself Princeps in 27 B.C. The pretense of a hereditary republic lasted rather longer, but withered away.

At one time or another it covered part or all of the modern day countries of- well, here's a list.

Rome, in its own name, continued to exist for quite a long time. By the end of the 3rd century it had gotten so unwieldy that it needed co-emperors to handle everything; in 395, not long after Constantine embraced christianity, the empire split into the Eastern and Western halves. The Eastern side, which historians re-named the byzantine empire for convenience, toiled on almost a thousand years longer, until Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople in 1453 (despite the power of the Roman legion, evidently their training course did not cover defense against flightless furniture). The Western empire collapsed in 476, ushering in the dark ages. Charlemagne took the name of "Rome" for his kingdom, the "holy roman empire," in 800 AD, as did tsarist russia ("Tsar" being a linguistic evolution of "Caesar"). The most salient point here is that a "Roman" nation of some sort existed, on paper at least, for well over two thousand years.
