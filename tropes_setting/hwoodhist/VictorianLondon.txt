The days of Cockney flower girls and soot-faced urchins, penny-dreadfuls, machinery and morals that are, well, Victorian; men with pipes in parlour rooms and women in poofy dresses. And I know the pea soup makes it difficult, but please — mind your step in Whitechapel...

Fortunately, if you're in trouble (and the situation is suitably intriguing), Holmes might give you a discount, especially if there is a hint that Professor Moriarty is involved. More mundane matters can be referred to the bobbies of Scotland Yard — and no, being maimed by machinery in the workplace doesn't count. Job prospects are a bit thin since the Industrial Revolution, and chimney-sweeping, workhouses, and factories aren't so bad (even when run by bitter old misers). Would you rather be in the poorhouse?

Be wary also of wispy men with capes and strangely pointy teeth, cultists and convicts, mad and mercurial scientists, boarding schools, wide-eyed waifs and suspect meat pies. of course, the strange man you saw might just be your secret uncle's best friend's sister's former roommate's dog.

A trope that is disturbingly accurate at times. The Victorian Era also happened in the rest of the country, of course, but as we all know britain is only london. Also the de facto default setting for steam punk stories.
