Any story set in the american west during the frontier era — generally from about 1843, the year the Oregon Trail was completed, to 1890, the year the US Census Bureau declared the frontier closed; most often between the end of the american civil war and 1890.

Perhaps surprisingly, the Western genre is older than they think; in fact, it predates the classic Western era. It has its roots in the early 19th century novels of james fenimore cooper (set in the then-frontier, which was well east of the Mississippi at the time) and his imitators, as well as 19th century "dime novels"—meaning that, like the gangster films of the thirties, the genre was originally pretty much contemporary with its source material. In fact no less a figure than wild bill hickok was already a star in dozens of embellished stories by the time he died in 1876. By the turn of the century a lot of the stock Western tropes had already been established in popular imagination: see western characters.

Westerns made a very early leap to film with The Great Train Robbery in 1903. William S. Hart (Hell's Hinges and many other films) became the first big star of movie Westerns. Westerns remained popular throughout the next few decades, though their golden age truly arrived in the 1930s.

Enormously popular on TV and in the movies in the 1950s and 1960s: Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Wagon Train, Rawhide, Branded, The Wild Wild West, Have Gun  Will Travel, The Rifleman, The Big Valley...

In recent decades the genre has been uncommon on TV, though it's never been entirely gone: the seventies had The Life And Times Of Grizzly Adams and Little House on the Prairie; the nineties brought Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman; and Deadwood was a critical success in the turn of the millennium.

Common plotlines include a cattle drive, a train job, and a bank robbery.

There's a wanted poster on every wall and it's more savage the further south you go.

There's an important distinction between the "classic" Western (The Lone Ranger-type stuff) and the "revisionist" Western (High Noon, The Searchers, the Dollars trilogy, The Wild Bunch, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Unforgiven). The former is shiny and heroic. The latter is darker and edgier, and often embodies a paradox: "Civilization can only be defended from barbarians by men with guns, but once you pick up a gun, you become a barbarian yourself." In the 21st century, the distinction seems fuzzy, as most of the "best" (or at least, most fondly-remembered) Westerns are the revisionist ones — and therefore they are now seen as the core of the genre.

The Western is usually set on the American frontier, but sometimes go farther afield to places like Alaska (North To Alaska, The Far Country), Mexico (The Wild Bunch, Vera Cruz, The Professionals), canada (North West Mounted Police) and Australia (The Proposition, Quigley Down Under).

In terms of time, the genre's heyday (as stated above) is a 25-year span in the 19th century, but there are examples set earlier (Drums Along the Mohawk takes place during the american revolution when upstate New York was frontier country) and later into the early 20th century (sam peckinpah's The Ballad of Cable Hogue ends with the title character ). For series that use Western tropes but are set in the modern day, see new old west.

A subtrope of period piece. Often overlaps with settling the frontier. See also western characters and spaghetti western. Also a reason why most people believe all deserts have cacti - the majority of Westerns were filmed at kirk's rock.

When a series that isn't the western visits the wild west or borrows heavily from its imagery for a story, it's a cowboy episode.

       Osterns (Easterns) are Westerns made in the Eastern Bloc, the most notable being East Germany's Winnetou movies, especially the treasure of silver lake. Another example could be Wilcze Echa, Polish Ostern set immediately after WWII (with looters and guerillas instead of bandits) on the Polish-Czechoslovakian border.
