Stonepunk is a sub-genre of the punk punk science fiction genre. Stonepunk focuses on pre-technological developments in pre-historic times, its juxtapositions of the modern world with the primitive, and the effects of an early form of 'advanced' technology on society, like the flintstones, based on primitive materials such as rock, fire, clay, rope, wood and water. Unlike most classic cyber punk or steam punk influenced fiction like clock punk, the Stone Age supplies the inspiration behind a modified form of technology based on the materials provided by the natural elements and surrounding environment. bamboo technology is common. Depending on the setting, there may be sufficiently advanced bamboo technology as well.
