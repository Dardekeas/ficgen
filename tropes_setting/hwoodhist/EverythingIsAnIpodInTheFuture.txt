As the aesthetics of technology change, our vision of the future does, too. raygun gothic gave way to crystal spires and togas, in turn supplanted by used future and cyber punk (and then all kinds of punk punk). at the time of this writing, the most common style for the future is a mix of all of the foregoing, plus... well, the ipod (or the iphone, or ipad, or any ios).

Right now, being cutting-edge is all about plain black and white (maybe pastel colours if you're lucky), translucent plastic, smoothed edges, screens that slide and flip out, touch screens, unobtrusive buttons, minimalist advertising and displays, lights that come out of nowhere and catchy little chimes when the devices start up. And of course, it's all small and convenient. For current evidence, look no further than the success of the iPod and the iPhone ranges, and the imac style they were based on, their imitators and other things that have adopted the style, such as pretty much the entire range of the latest game consoles.

everything is online, and physical data storage either consists of an equivalent of a USB thumbdrive or doesn't exist at all, considering that computers are so small and compact you can carry them anywhere and transfer data wirelessly. Interfaces are designed to be soothing, easy to use and colourful, and if intelligent they'll probably be annoyingly helpful.

Of course, like every other "futuristic" visual style used in previous decades, this trope will probably be considered zeerust after a while.

Contrast raygun gothic, which is its opposite in a number of ways. See also holographic terminal and ascetic aesthetic. For when everything (in the future or otherwise) is actually made by Apple, see everyone owns a mac, as well as iphony for direct parodies of Apple products.
