The War On Terror is the current setting for a lot of present day media, although how much it features in a given work of media varies considerably.

A cornerstone of the usa central-government policy from late September 2001 'till... well, now, sort of. The 'War on Terror' is not a war in the conventional sense, but is the collective name given to the USA government's attempts — with the help of various parties including nato and the un — to prevent small groups of private individuals from killing its citizens. The 'war' has brought out the uglier side of the USA given its willingness to use morally dubious means — chiefly the torture, indefinite imprisonment, and execution of (mostly foreign) suspects without trial — and actively kill thousands of other countries' citizens to save her own. The USA has lost several thousand soldiers in its much-criticized military expeditions to afghanistan and iraq, which when paired with its loss of 3,000 civilians in the attack on new york city's World Trade Center on the 11th of September 2001, gives a total of nearly 10,000 US citizens dead.

On the other hand, some 300,000+ foreign civilians have died during the course of the war, though most of these were not killed by USA or NATO troops or fire-support (artillery bombardments and air-strikes) but rather in the civil disorder which resulted after the Afghan and Iraqi regimes were toppled. The USA's handling of the situation in Iraq, which under Saddam Hussein's right-wing dictatorship had been an old Cold-War Ally of the USA against Persia, was particularly poor by all accounts; the country essentially went totally ungoverned for several months, and the delicate peace that had been maintained only by the brutality of Hussein's secular police state dissolved amidst violence that was not formal or organized enough to merit the term 'civil war'.

Given the nebulous nature of the 'war', it's hard to say when (if ever) it'll end. The death of osama, son of laden — in an illegal commando raid into the USA's old Cold War Ally-turned-distant-friend Pakistan in 2011, was seen by some as a sign of the war winding down. The 'Coalition of the Willing' (The USA, Britain, and Australia withdrew its troops from Iraq several years ago, leaving behind a dysfunctional parliamentary democracy still marred by an unhealthy degree of civil violence and corruption. Most UN/NATO forces in Afghanistan will also be withdrawn in the next few years, and are set to leave the country in a similar condition.

However, events took a turn for the worse again in 2014 with the sudden rise of the Islamic State, a self-styled caliphate whose effectiveness was matched by their brutality in seizing control of large swathes of Iraq and Syria (which explains their other name, ISIS - Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). With Iraq's unstable government and Syria involved in its own civil war, ISIS was able to roll in with ease, catching the West almost entirely by surprise. Countless surrendered Iraqi soldiers and civilians were killed, and others were forced to flee into the wilderness where they would either be killed or starved. While the United States has repeatedly stated it will not send combat troops into the fight, over 1000 soldiers, special operation forces, and a carrier battle group have been sent to Iraq. Humanitarian relief efforts turned into targeted airstrikes supporting Iraqi and Kurdish forces, which is turn has become a full scale air war against ISIS. At present the United States announced its intention to build a new coalition to destroy ISIS for good.

Indeed, it's hard to say when exactly it started either, for though the 2001 attacks were what caused the USA under President G.W. Bush to actively declare a 'War on Terror', attacks on the USA's citizens and public servants had actually been happening for a while by that point. In fact the 'Al Qaida' organization declared war on the USA as early as 1996, and some of the people who were later involved with that group were making unofficial attacks on the USA as early as 1993 and the (New York) World Trade Center bombing. However, very few people died in these and under bill clinton's Presidency they were largely ignored. Other attacks included one on the U.S.S. Cole and various US embassies dotted about the Middle East.

Compare with defcon five, which has more clearly defined, though ignorantly inverted readiness levels. Contrast with the vietnam war, for the USA's last experience of 'a-symmetric warfare', with a much more impressive death-toll (at some ten-plus times greater) to boot. Contrast also the much less bloody boer war for another good example of an asymmetric war — one that has since been called 'The British Empire's Vietnam'. See also the unsuccessful 'war' on drugs.

If you're looking for the actual documentary called 9/11, it's here.

There are multiple levels:The situation isn't really mentioned at all. It's either not relevant (as in the speculative fiction genre), or it's pretended it's not happening. This does not bar the show from making comments via metaphor though.

  The  The new     Just about completely ignored in  The thing is there in the background, it's acknowledged it's happening, it affects the plot somewhat, but ultimately doesn't directly affect the plot on a day to day basis.

 In    Comedies like      Dr Watson from   David Kelley's shows mention it from time to time.  Dean and Sam in   A common one for the cop show that otherwise has to deal with its third serial killer of the season. This includes attacks on veterans, possible involvement of someone in Islamist terrorism and asylum seekers.

 Frank Castle in        In  In  Space 1889 It turns up in a few plots. A few plots, such as Anarchy in the Ether from Tales from the Ether, are about the struggle against 19th century terrorists, mostly anarchists and Fenians. Late 19th century is sometimes considered the birth of revolutionary terrorism. Some of its methods, theories and ideologies come from this time: such as Bakunins ideas about propaganda of the deed. So it is sort of a prequel to the modern war on terrorism.

 In   Islamist terrorists turn up a lot, but there are other people as well.

    Later seasons of    Though    The              The  The 2010 version of   Were it not for 9/11 and the War on Terror (and Quite a few TV and film examples, including a number of Afghan ones, the only one to break out so far is 2013's Lone Survivor, which is notable for taking a highly patriotic view of war. Lions for Lambs went down badly with critics and the public alike, as well being criticised for the title being an apparent misquote of the world war one expression "lions led by donkeys". Studio 60 featured Tom's brother being kidnapped in Afghanistan in its closing five-parter, then ended in fairy tale style.

An Afghanistan D20 role-playing boardgame has been published, doing a fairly serious job with describing the early stages of the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan. Times have changed however, and today (this is written in Kabul in the autumn of 2008) the war looks quite different.

"The Road to Guantanamo" is a 2006 docu-drama about the detention in Guantanamo of three British men picked up in Afghanistan in 2001. It won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the Silver Bear for Best Director at 2006 Berlin Film Festival. Contains archive news footage from the period, and recounts the men's experiences from their travels into Afghanistan to their capture and imprisonment.

And then there's the new medal of honor video game that has you as both a soldier and a Tier 1 Operator fighting in Afghanistan. It semi-accurately depicts the war, centering on a fictionalised version of Operation Anaconda, with, in true medal of honor fashion, everyone who isn't American (Or in this case, Afghan) conveniently excised.

 Outside of Iraq itself, movies and TV (there's a few novels out there and a number of computer game mods on the conflict, the latter of which raises the moral issue of playing games involving an ongoing war) that directly deals with the conflict and is actually set in Iraq is few and far between. The first attempt at a TV series in the US, Over There, was critically acclaimed, but ultimately cancelled (some speculate it was cancelled for "political reasons"). In contrast, the 2008 HBO miniseries Generation Kill is based on the 2004 book of the same name about an embedded reporter's experience with his unit of Marines and has at least one character played by his real-life counterpart (Sgt. Rudy Reyes as himself).

All the movies are pretty obscure and have effectively flopped at the box office, with some commentators arguing that "war movie fatigue" on the part of the public was responsible. On the other hand, some have argued that "anti-war movie fatigue" is responsible.

One exception would be The Hurt Locker, which won an Oscar for Best Picture. However, it should be noted that it is also the lowest grossing film to win that award.

A good past example that may serve as a guide for the future (due to general perception, accurate or not, on the Iraq War) is the vietnam war. It took four years after the fall of Saigon for the first widely-known (Go Tell The Spartans isn't that well known) period and area set film to come out and that, Apocalypse Now, is also Heart of Darkness in Vietnam. Full Metal Jacket wasn't until 1986. On the other hand, during previous American conflicts films were produced expressing a pro-war position (if not quite actual propaganda). During world war ii Hollywood was essentially co-opted by the US war department to produce pro-war films and cartoons (although every country did the same thing, except, ironically, Germany, which mainly produced period films). During the Vietnam War films in support of the war like The Green Berets (with John Wayne) were made, and the vast majority of 80s action films were supportive of the Reagan administration's foreign policy. In contrast, the war on terror hasn't produced many films or TV shows that expressly support it (with the possible exception of a post-9/11 terrorism movie or two).

Appears as backstory quite a bit, especially in Brothers and Sisters, where blonde republican sex kitten Kitty, trying to prevent her brother going to Iraq, tries to bribe the Senator she later gets engaged to and performs on an on-camera volte-face. One can't help feel someone's going strawman political on this one (supporting a war until it directly affects you). Justin eventually goes of his own free will anyway and is seriously wounded there.

  In While Iran is somewhat a separate issue — Iranians aren't Arabs but Persians, they don't speak Arabic but Farsi, and they're Shias not Sunni — they're lumped in these days because of two main reasons. One: the apparent threat, real or otherwise, of the regime in Tehran. Two: they're brown and live in the same general direction (exactly between Afghanistan and Iraq, in fact), what more do you want?

 The There are a couple of shows out there that use their settings and plots to make points, usually rather anvilicious, on the War On Terror:

 The second season of   9th Company is a strange example: The events in the film predate the   The cinematic reboot of    In John Birmingham's  Flipped on its head in Matt Ruff's  The new  The 2006     The  The UNSC were also in a revolution by "The Insurrection," which had turned to terrorism to fight for freedom. However, in many ways this is more reminiscent of the troubles than any more recent conflict.

Not to be confused with the Australian comedy series The Chaser's War On Everything, though they've certainly touched on the matter on occasion.
