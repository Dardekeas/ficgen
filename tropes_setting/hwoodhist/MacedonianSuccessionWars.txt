After the conquest of the Persian empire by alexander the great the plunder was divided up. According to legend our rather ax-crazy young conqueror declared that his empire should go to the strongest. Alexander's chief commanders took him quite literally and spent the next few generations trying to decide this important question. As they could not reach a decision they ended up in a state of mutual stalemate, which allowed the entry of the roman republic.

This era was noted for the spread of Greek culture and its mingling with other cultures. While most of the old fashioned Greek City-state's were reduced into insignificance, the balance of power allowed them to live after a fashion. Militarily this was a time of elaboration of Greek and Macedonian techniques. As every army was descended from Alexander's badass army they could gain no tactical advantage over one another though they tried all kinds of techniques including the use of elephants. The result was simply a tie between the powers involved.
