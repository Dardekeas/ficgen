The Partition of british india, simply called Partition or the Partition Era, refers to the splitting of india by the colonial authorities on the eve of the subcontinent's breaking away from british rule. More importantly, it refers to the various humanitarian, societal, economic, political, and criminal crises that arose from the rushed manner the British had carried it out. This event also created a great deal of the initial vitriol between India and Pakistan, made worse later by the kashmir question, which itself was a direct consequece of this event.

Generally used as a backdrop in a great deal of Indian and Pakistani literature and media due to its tragic and dramatic nature.
