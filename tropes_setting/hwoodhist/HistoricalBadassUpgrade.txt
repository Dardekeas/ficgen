Sometimes a historical-domain character is portrayed by adding a copious amount of badassery and stuff blowing up, that was either far lesser or non-existent with the real life person. The reasons could range from sloppy research to rule of cool.

Maybe a king, who was known for very little else but diplomacy, gets to be a war hero instead. Maybe Mohandas Gandhi gets to fight grizzlies. Maybe a pope hunted vampires in his spare time.

kung-fu jesus is a subtrope.

Compare beethoven was an alien spy for a possible justification of this trope. adaptational badass is when this happens to a character from a previous work. memetic badass is when the Badassery is upgraded through memetic mutation.

See also historical hero upgrade and historical villain upgrade, both of which this trope may very well overlap with if the character's more heroic or more villainous actions come off as Badass.
