The more northern, cold-climate cousins of the pirate, native to dark age europe, who spend a lot of their time cruising in their dragon-headed longships, pillaging and burning any hapless peasant villages that happen to get in their way.

Vikings in fiction tend to incorporate elements of the berserker (fitting, as the medieval Scandinavians were the progenitors of this fighting style and remain its most iconic users) and proud warrior race guy, and always wear those spiffy horned helmets. Vikings are always quite hairy, with long beards and longer braids of barbarism flying in the ocean breeze. Being Nordic, most of them are blonde or red-headed, but black-haired Vikings are as common as they were in real life.

The trope name is a pun on Vikings' reputation for raping and pillaging, and the horned helmets that they never actually wore except for ceremonial occasions. The myth that they wore them at all times started with the Romans, which was unintentionally reinforced by some archeologists digging up a Viking helmet near a couple of drinking horns and assuming that they had once been one piece. Such helmets were not only impractical, they would actually be dangerous if worn in combat (a helmet with such a feature could be grabbed by an enemy who could pull the wearer off-balance.) They sometimes suggested winged helmets as well, which were actually worn by the Celts, also only for religious ceremonies.
