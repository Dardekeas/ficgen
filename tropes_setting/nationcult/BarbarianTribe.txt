The Barbarian Tribe is usually portrayed as a band of barely-literate, and often chaotic warriors. They have no problem burning villages, dog-kicking, playing polo with severed heads, and even stealing cable. In a work of fiction, they may form the mook army of the dark lord, evil prince, or religious fanatic.

If the work of fiction wants to portray them positively, they will be composed of proud warrior race guys or noble savages who are in touch with the environment. A barbarian hero will originate in one of these tribes.

This is truth in television to an extent, since one of the main thrusts of history in Eurasia (until the advent of gunpowder weapons) was the periodic invasions of urban areas in China and Europe by mounted steppe tribes. Many other groups of people, such as the ancient Germanic peoples (this includes Norse raiders), Native American tribes and tribal africans, could also be considered this.

On the other hand, Claude Levi-Strauss said the only real barbarians are the ones who believe in barbarians. The Ancient Greeks, who invented the term, applied it pretty liberally to anyone they didn't like, including peoples who were quite civilized by any reasonable standard (like the egyptians and the Persians) and even other Greeks who didn't live up to Athenian ideals. A modern work that applies character development to its barbarians may quickly find them to be not so different.

See the horde for when they are portrayed as always chaotic evil. See also hordes from the east and born in the saddle.

The sufficiently advanced often compare those "below" them to this.
