A setting in which the dominant culture is a fusion of American and Asian influences, resulting in an entire city (or world) that resembles a Chinatown writ large. Glass and steel skyscrapers with flared pagoda roofs, chinese curses dropped into english speech, mcninjas working for the mafia, that kind of thing.

This typically involves American culture blended with either Chinese culture, Japanese culture, or a vague far east jumble. It can result from china, japan, or america taking over the world, or it can be a mashup fantasy counterpart culture. Unlike many culture chop suey settings like ancient grome or spexico, Americasia usually isn't the result of sloppiness or indifference, but a deliberate artistic choice.

Americasian settings were very common in '80s cyberpunk, back when many thought that japan was going to take over the world. They've been making a comeback in recent years with the increasing popularity of Japanese and Korean culture in the West. This trope is pretty specific to American culture rather than just any Western culture, in part because the United States is closer to Asia and has a large and rapidly growing Asian minority concentrated around the country's most culturally influential areasâ€” california, new york city, and washington, dc.

Subtrope to culture chop suey. Compare mukokuseki, the blurring of racial rather than cultural lines between East and West. Please limit examples to settings where this is the dominant culture, not just an ethnic enclave or any random instance of American and Asian cultures mingling.
