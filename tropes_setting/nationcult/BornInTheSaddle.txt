A culture so thoroughly in love with horses, they may as well be centaurs. They fight on horseback, they travel on horseback, they eat on horseback, they sleep on horseback. They probably aren't literally born there, but they'll certainly start learning to ride before they can walk.

Expect a lot of jokes about just how much they love their horses.

Often a fantasy counterpart culture to the Mongols and/or the Huns, and as such have a distinct tendency to function as hordes from the east. However, as the Lord of the Rings example of the Rohirrim demonstrates, they can just as well be a more civilised, chivalric culture. Don't be surprised â€” "chivalry" derives from the French word "chevalier," a horseback rider or knight. Whether or not they're the bad guys, they're sure to be a proud warrior race (you can't get much studying done at a canter, after all).

Usually expert horse archers, though tend to be just as good with a sword.

Sometimes the steed of choice will be a horse of a different color, but actual Equus f. caballus seem to be favoured for some reason.
