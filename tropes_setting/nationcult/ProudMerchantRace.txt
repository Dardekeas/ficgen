A proud warrior race is a culture whose hat is war. Conversely, a Proud Merchant Race is one whose hat is being intrepid merchants. Has overlap with space jews, but often in a positive manner with implications of having a tradition of enterprise and exploration. However, on the flip side, aspects of the corrupt corporate executive who will do anything for a quick buck may be in place since it's deemed less politically incorrect to depict aliens or fantastic creatures in this fashion than real humans, and there may be an honest john's dealership or two in the ranks of them.

Also overlaps with merchant city and sometimes with space cossacks. One difference is that a merchant city can be just a place where intrepid merchants from elsewhere visit whereas a Proud Merchant Race has to conduct trading on its own. As trading long distances is dangerous and outlaws ever present, sometimes a Proud Merchant Race is a Proud Warrior Race as well, or at least a race whose martial prowess is dangerously underestimated.

Despite positive portrayals, a fair deal of fantastic racism often shows up, especially in older works, with someone getting shrewdly out-negotiated (read: screwed over) by them or occasionally just outright cheated. Another negative tends to be that non-merchants in their ranks likely suffer klingon scientists get no respect.

Compare proud warrior race and proud scholar race for species with different hats.
