No, this isn't when yakko warner performs a musical number.

A form of montage that uses shots of various cultures from all around the planet, doing the same thing.

It's frequently used to show a global unity, that in the times of the greatest fight, the direst crisis, or the merriest celebration, we, humans, are not so different after all. Despite that, it might still mildly poke fun at national stereotypes. Due to the lowest common denominator, if a culture is meant to be recognized from a single shot, this picture will probably contain the single most famous landmark of that culture as well.

Distantly related to travel montage, which might use similar imagery. Often used with gondor calls for aid when the called groups are also different cultures, and they are all shown answering the call.
