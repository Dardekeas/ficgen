A colossal statue in the form of a lion with a human head wearing an ancient Egyptian headdress (and which may or may not have originally been a normal lion head) The Sphinx is one of the best known man-made structures in the real world. It is so closely associated with egypt that it serves as an instant visual clue of the setting, even more so than the pyramids (which also exist in other parts of the world.) The Sphinx is located next to the Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest one in the world.This Sphinx has nothing to do with the one from the greek myth of Oedipus (the one with the riddle of the sphinx). Rather, the Greek called the statue (which is at least 4000 years old) Sphinx due to its resemblance to that monster. However, The Sphinx is considered "riddling" because, even today, we don't know who made it or why; most puzzling, there are no surviving records from that time that explain these things. Naturally, that has led to lots of crazy theories about it.It is famously without a nose. popular history attributes this to napoleon bonaparte's cannons accidentally shooting it off during the brief French occupation of Egypt (1798-1801), but in reality the nose was most likely hacked off by a 14th-century Muslim religious fanatic (who was hanged for vandalism by the Sultan in response).In fiction, often the target of monumental damage or even monumental theft. Or just getting off its duff and stomping on people.
