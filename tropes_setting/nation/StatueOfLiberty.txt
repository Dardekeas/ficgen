The Statue of Liberty has become such a world-renowned icon that just by seeing it most people instantly realize either where the setting of a story is (New York) or that it involves America and its ideals in some way.

A gift from the people of France (to celebrate the parallel fights for freedom of Colonial America and Napoleonic France, and having helped each other many times) the statue sits on a pedestal on Liberty Island, located just off the coast of Manhattan. It is highly visible from Ellis Island, where immigrants to the united states used to be processed before entering the country.

Properly building and setting up the statue took years; it became a project that attracted national interest. Pieces such as the arm and head were exposed to the public before installation. Naturally, there was a big celebration upon its conclusion.

One of the Seven (manmade) Wonders of the World.
