A gathering of female characters, particularly teens or pre-teens. Often to talk about boys or make-overs. A staple of the simpler days of the dom com.

More often called a pyjama party in the UK, seeing as that's the general clothing worn at such an event. And anyway, who sleeps at one of these things? wacky fratboy hijinx will often involve trying to gatecrash (or at the very least, watch).

See also slumber party ploy.
