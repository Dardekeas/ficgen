When the scary surprise party turns really scary.

In TV-Land, parties are an occasion for teenagers to go wild and spin the bottle, families to play parlor games, and psychotic hosts to massacre their guests. Then there is the Surprise Party; and 90% of the time, surprise parties in fiction will end in disaster. This might vary from something as small as someone getting humiliated or showing up naked, to something as threatening as your city getting invaded by a giant monster. Can be played for laughs or for drama.

A rare but not unknown variation is where the character trying to organize the party runs into some heavily abnormal trouble. In these cases the party itself will take place at the end of the episode/movie/chapter, and will be uneventful.
