You've spent hours hanging balloons, decorations and banners on the wall. You've cooked the food to perfection. The cake is ready, and the candles have already been lit. You even have the music all sorted out. It's a perfect birthday party, but there's just one tiny problem - nobody's coming.

Birthdays are supposed to be a great occasion to get together with friends, when everything is about you. So when someone has only themselves to celebrate their birthday with, it's a sign that they really are alone.

Writers tend to use this trope to establish that the character in question is the woobie (if played for drama) or the chew toy (if played for laughs). It may also be a cloud cuckoo lander since these will often understand the "everything is about you" tendency literally (if a friend is with you, then not everything is, technically, about you).
