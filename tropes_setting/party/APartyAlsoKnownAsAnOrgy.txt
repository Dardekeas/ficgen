For fictional people past puberty, any wild party with both genders, teen or otherwise, is all about one thing: getting it on. This can be a good or bad thing, depending on many factors. Although one absolute in fiction is that if it's a teenage girl going, and you're her guardian, it's always a bad thing.

Part of the reason for this is simply that all men are perverts and all women are lustful.

If it's planned and advertised as an orgy, it doesn't count.Compare hookers and blow, sex, drugs and rock & roll. See also binge montage.
