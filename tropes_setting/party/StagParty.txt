A guy has a wedding, and they usually throw a wild party as their last day as a bachelor before the wedding day. Often, it gets wild, often having a lot of beer and smoking. Sometimes, they'll also go to a strip club or hire a stripper for the party. Occasionally, the bride-to-be (or the wife of one of the invited, in some cases) will walk in on the party and be horrified at this aspect. Known as a Bachelor Party in the United States.

Recently, its been increasingly popular in comedy to show the guys try have a wild stag party only to have it fall apart in a disappointing fashion. The stripper is over the hill, or a guy. The stripper dressed up as a police officer is an actual policewoman. The car breaks down. Etc. Often, while the guys expect that the women are having something akin to a bridal shower or a Tupperware party, they're having a bachelorette party as wild as what the men were hoping for.

Somewhat of a truth in television, although it rarely ever gets as serious as above. Also note that its distaff counterpart, alternatively called a Hen Party or Bachelorette Party, has also become common.

Compare wild teen party. See jumping out of a cake for the stripper in the cake which is often included.
