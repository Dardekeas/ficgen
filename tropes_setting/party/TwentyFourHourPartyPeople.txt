When TV characters hold a birthday party or baby shower or a similar event, the party will be attended by four or five familiar characters, as well as about twenty people who have never been seen before and will never be seen again. Since we see pretty much every aspect of the characters' lives, we can't help but wonder who these people are and when the characters had time to meet them, let alone befriend them. Strangely, by the time of the relevant character's next birthday, they've completely changed around their extraneous circle of friends. Also, rarely will the main characters ever interact with these people at the party, unless it's just for a quick throwaway joke, so one must wonder why all these extras are even at this party to begin with.

This is especially common in sitcoms.

Not to be confused with the movie 24 Hour Party People, a biopic of Factory Records and the manchester music scene in the 1980s/1990s, though both the trope and that movie are named after the happy mondays song.
