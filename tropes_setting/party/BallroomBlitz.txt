For whatever reason there's a dance or a dinner, or a party of some kind, going on — be it a snooty royal or noble ball, a school dance or a wedding, or maybe a particularly large birthday party. If it's a more formal occasion, pretty much everyone is dressed up. There's a fairly good chance that if our heroes have been invited, the big bad or his mooks are quite likely to invite themselves; be assured something catastrophic and violent is going to occur, usually in the vicinity of either the entrance or the dance floor.

In most circumstances everyone will be unarmed, except maybe the guards (if they even have them). Cue panicked screams, and the action girl complaining about having to fight in a dress... until she rips the hem off.

May overlap with a fête worse than death — or, in a comedy, hilarity ensues. Compare wedding smashers. If the hero is wealthy enough, he may end up paying for the action scene out of generosity.

it's, it's a ballroom blitz! it's, it's a ballroom blitz! it's, it's, a ballroom blitz! yeah! it's a ballroom blitz!
