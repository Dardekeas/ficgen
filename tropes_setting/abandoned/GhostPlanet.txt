What you get when a ghost town is global in scale. Another planet or another dimension that, by the time we get to see it, has been left in ruins for a long, long time. There are signs here and there that this world once boasted a civilization, maybe even a great civilization, but all that's left now are a few decaying remnants. The world need not be entirely barren of life, but, generally speaking, if there are enough of the original denizens left to form a town or city, it's not a Ghost Planet.

Please keep in mind, a Ghost Planet should not be a future version of our own Earth (or at least not explicitly so). Only alien worlds which have gone through their own armageddon (somewhere between Class 2 and Class 5 on the apocalypse how scale) need apply.

Not to be confused with space ghost's home planet, or Ghost World.

Compare ghost town and ghost city. May be a beautiful void.
