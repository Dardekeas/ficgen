Super Metroid was the third game in the Metroid series and the antepenultimate game in the timeline (taking place before Metroid: Other M and immediately following the events of Metroid II: Return of Samus). It was released for the super nintendo entertainment system in 1994 and later released on the virtual console a few times in the 2000's.The plot immediately picks up where the second game finished, with Samus leaving the Metroid hatchling she found at a Federation lab for study. Ridley and the Space Pirates promptly show up and steal it, prompting a distress call which summons Samus just in time to chase them to Zebes...The game retains the metroidvania style of gameplay of previous titles, as well as introducing new equipment. Unlike Metroid II, all the items you pick up stay with you (rather than needing to strategically choose which beam to carry), although you can switch between some in the equipment screen (unlike Metroid: Fusion where it was fixed and the 3D games where beams were selected in real time). It was also notable for being the largest game released on the SNES at the time, using a 24-Megabit cartridge (that's roughly 3MB).
