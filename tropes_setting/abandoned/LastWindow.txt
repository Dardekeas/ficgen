After waking up from a day spent sleeping in his car, he gets a message on his pager and calls his employer to find out he's been fired. His troubles compound when he returns to his home at the Cape West Apartments, only to learn the building is scheduled to be demolished at the end of the month. As Kyle begins to gather his thoughts about this, he receives an anonymous letter requesting that he find something called the Scarlet Star in the apartments. He soon realizes that the apartments are connected to his father's death, and begins investigating.Though Cing's bankruptcy initially threatened no export for you, it was eventually confirmed for an EU release in September 2010 under the title Last Window: The Secret of Cape West. Although there was no North American release, the fact that the game has no region locking means North American gamers can play an imported copy with no problems, especially since English, French, and Spanish are among the languages that version of the game can be played in.
