Originally, Princess Mononoke was meant to be hayao miyazaki's swan song, but much to the delight of the anime world, he returned with a film that managed to top Princess Mononoke's staggering box-office numbers.Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, "Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting-Away"), said to be inspired by a 9-year-old girl Miyazaki met, is a surreal adventure film that defies simple explanation, but can be simplistically described as Japan's version of Alice in Wonderland:Chihiro, a sullen young girl unwillingly moving to a new town, is stranded in the spirit world after her parents stop by what appears to be an abandoned amusement park and eat food that turns them into pigs. At first, her only aid is Haku, a mysterious boy who finds her shelter and a job in a bathhouse that caters to these spirits; eventually, Chihiro makes more friends as she searches for a way to make her parents human again and escape the spirit world before she forgets her real identity. Oh, and that's just the first half-hour â€” which doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the odd denizens of the spirit world, ranging from the villainous bathhouse manager Yubaba to arachnid worker Kamajii to the enigmatic, voiceless spirit No Face.Despite its bizarre events, Spirited Away is regarded by many to have succeeded in depicting a world that was strangely realistic and engrossing; it also never loses sight of the self-growth of Chihiro as she matures from a whiny girl to a confident young woman. It should go without saying that the trademark stunning animation of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli is also showcased in this film. The fact that it won the oscar for Best Animated Feature Film (the only traditionally-animated film and the only anime film to do so to date) should be noted as the Oscars tend to favor CG Western Animated productions.Not to be confused with the Australian TV show Spirited. Or the 1974 film Swept Away. Or that film's 2002 remake/Madonna vehicle. Please.
