Friday the 13th, a villain-based franchise of slasher movies (with twelve installments and a thirteenth in development), revolves around a hockey-masked wearing, machete-wielding, psychopathic manchild Zombie named Jason Voorhees. Local legends say Jason drowned at Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of the teenage camp counselors, and decades later, the lake and surrounding campgrounds — considered "cursed" by locals — become the setting for a series of mass murders staged on or around Friday the 13th (Jason's birthday).Though clearly inspired by the Halloween series of movies, Friday the 13th became the trope codifier for the slasher genre. The films typically start with a developing doomed characters sequence: a group of teenagers — typically counselors or vacationers — have come to Crystal Lake for various reasons, some of which involve sex and drugs. This group, as well as other minor characters, end up hunted down and killed in a variety of ways — and none of the living members of the group grow wise to this until the final girl (and occasionally a tagalong kid) discovers the bodies and forces a confrontation with the killer.While each movie follows the previous one (and sometimes start directly after the previous film), the series doesn't have many recurring elements aside from Jason and the Crystal Lake location. Parts 4, 5, and 6 buck the trend, as they feature the character of Tommy Jarvis. As a boy (in 4), Tommy partially loses his mind after Jason kills his mother (and Tommy kills Jason in turn); when he grows up, Tommy dedicates himself to the destruction of Jason at any cost — but in an ironic twist, Tommy's quest to eradicate Jason inadvertently becomes the catalyst for Jason's resurrection as a zombie.Jason's infamous hockey mask serves as one half of the hockey mask and chainsaw trope; Jason never actually uses a chainsaw in any of the films, which include:            There is also:     The franchise also slapped its name onto a horror anthology series — Friday The 13th: The Series — which had very little to do with the films.
