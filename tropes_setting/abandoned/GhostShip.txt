The main characters receive a distress call or randomly come across a (seemingly) deserted vehicle and have to figure out what happened and where everybody went. Usually they run across exactly what happened when it tries to eat them. A big dumb object may be involved. And sometimes there are actual ghosts.

Compare derelict graveyard.
