The Beeb holds copyright to the title several times over; the original use of the show name was way back in 1967 with the birth of Radio One. Left-field DJ john peel presented Top Gear with John Peel that showcased the very best in avant-garde music, with comedy interludes from the sort of people who later became monty python and the Bonzo-Dog Band.
