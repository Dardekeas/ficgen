A two-part series of games by monolith productions - Condemned: Criminal Origins, and Condemned 2: Bloodshot. Their selling point is their vicious and brutal melee combat, which combines with (at times barely comprehensible) storytelling.Condemned: Criminal Origins takes place in a fictional U.S. city. named "Metro City". Ethan Thomas, rising star in the FBI's Serial Crimes Unit gifted with incredible forensic instincts, is framed for murder when investigating a crime scene. The next morning, an enigmatic man claiming to be a friend of the family comes and warns Ethan to flee, before the police arrive. This prompts Ethan, at this man's urging, to begin searching for the serial killer that set him up. As the game progresses, a trail of dead birds and murderous hobos begin hinting that something is wrong in the city, more wrong than he might have ever hoped.Condemned 2: Bloodshot takes place in the same city, one year later. Ethan has slipped into a drunken stupor, quitting his job at SCU despite clearing his name after hunting down the serial killer that framed him. When the enigmatic man from last game calls his old partner, begging to know where he is, she is sent to find him, and he is brought back to help in solving a new series of cases, seemingly related to the serial killings of yesteryear. In doing so, he begins to find out both about what makes him so special, and why everyone is always so berserker...
