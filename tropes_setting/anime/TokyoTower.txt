The Japanese built a rough copy of the  in tokyo in the 1950s as a tourist attraction and for TV and radio broadcasting. It's clearly visible from most of town, and is a frequent destination for class trips from local schools. (It is also sometimes referred to as "Touto Tower".)

Apparently, they built the thing out of imported alien phlebotinum, because it's also a major weirdness magnetâ€”at least in fiction, where it's often subject to monumental damage. If the big bad or the dragon are going to attack, they'll attack the tower at the precise moment that the protagonists are visiting it. If the ordinary high-school student and her friends are going to be sucked into another dimension, it'll happen while they're visiting Tokyo Tower. kaiju and robeasts seem to knock it over or blow it up on a regular basis. The government might secretly turn it into a superweapon. In fact,  warns, "Try to stay away from Tokyo Tower. It appears to mark an inter-universal nexus."

With all the suffering and destruction that happens there, it's a wonder that anyone is permitted near it...

It appears that the reason for its ubiquity is a combination of two powerful story compulsions: the need that spy characters (like james bond) have to fight on the eiffel tower every time they visit Paris, and the fact that tokyo is the center of the universe.

Since Tokyo Tower is not high enough to broadcast digital television signals over the same area, a new tower has been constructed: the "Tokyo Skytree", which opened its doors in May 2012. At 634 meters it is nearly twice as tall as its illustrious predecessor, and even though it has not been around for nearly as long, it seems to gradually take Tokyo Tower's place as an icon in anime.
