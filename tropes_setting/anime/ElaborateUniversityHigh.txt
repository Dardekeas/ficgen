A school — often a boarding school — typically housing students of high school age or lower, but of a size and structure resembling a college or university. Although a story may only follow a few characters, backgrounds and wide angle shots clearly show that the student body is quite large. In anime and manga, this often goes hand in hand with being a one-gender school.

May or may not be an academy of adventure of some sort.

Not necessarily related to the many University High Schools in real life, or high schools that are attached to and part of universities for that matter.
