Cosplay cafes are tea shops or small restaurants where the waitstaff's costumes (and frequently the decor and food) are themed around a scenario or fantasy. They typically offer cold and hot tea and coffee drinks, fancy desserts and light meals, often highly decorated and "cutesy", served with fan service with a smile.

A recent but very popular phenomenon in Japan, Maid Cafes and Cosplay Cafes cater to otaku of both sexes, whereas Butler Cafes usually attract a mostly female clientele (frequently yaoi fangirls).

A Maid Cafe features attractive waitresses who dress and "perform" as obsequious and obedient maids. A Butler Cafe is similar but with "butlers" and "footmen". Waitstaff at Maid and Butler cafes usually use extra-polite language, including the obligatory greeting "Welcome home, Master / Mistress!"

Cosplay Cafes feature a wide variety of other themes, such as "little sister", "miko", "railway cafe", etc. Other specialties include "josou" (female clothing) cafes, featuring cute guys in pretty dresses, and "dansou" (male clothing) cafes, featuring bifauxnen women in male drag. (Many Butler cafes are dansou cafes.)

school festivals frequently feature cafes as a class activity, and there is a better-than-even chance it'll be modeled after a Maid Cafe (or possibly a Butler Cafe if the class is mostly male).

For the more "adult" version, see hostess club / host club. Frequently uses french maid outfit. Compare fan service with a smile. If a couple goes to one together, the menu is extremely likely to include a date crÃªpe and perhaps some sweetheart sipping.
