Traditional Japanese houses are far from the modern Western style, as any anime fan knows. Japanese culture, a scarcity of building stone, a climate that ranges from subtropical to almost sub-arctic, Japan's island environment and the fact that Japan itself is both earthquake and typhoon-prone have resulted in building traditions that are very different from those seen in the West. Traditional Japanese houses are light, airy and flexible structures that are relatively easy to build and thus quick to replace.

While specific details vary by region, common features include a steep roof to shed rain, long eaves that provide protection from the rain and shade from the sun, a raised floor to get you up out of the mud, clear or translucent interior partitions and windows to allow for for "borrowed light", and exterior and interior walls and partitions composed largely of sliding doors and screens that allow the whole house to be opened up for ventilation, practices influenced by (and likely influencing) the relative lack of both privacy and physical modesty in pre-industrial Japan; people simply couldn't hide anything from their neighbors.

Traditional Japanese houses tend to be fairly spartan, with multipurpose rooms and relatively little furniture. Closets and cabinets are used to store bedding and clothing. At the most basic there may only be one main room, which functions as living, dining, or bedroom as the situation requires. Modern Japanese houses run the gamut from mostly traditional with some western features to tiny apartments little different from anything you'd find in the west.Some typical features of Japanese houses.

Genkan: The traditional Japanese entryway. Typically a tiled well in the floor where one removes their outdoor shoes, the genkan can be found even in the smallest studio apartments, even though it may be no larger than a doormat. Larger houses (Such as the Tendo residence in Ranma ½) will often have an entire entry hall, and schools even larger ones, where the shoe lockers can be found.

Shoji and Fushama (or Fusuma): The traditional wooden-framed rice paper screens used as partition walls and doors. Translucent shoji are typically found on the inner wall, and opaque fushama on the outside. These can be quite fragile, and poking them full of holes is often used as a sign of pettiness and immaturity.

Amado: Sliding rain doors used to enclose Japanese houses from the elements. Typically glazed and configured so they will slide into a stack on either or both sides of the engawa. In My Neighbor Totoro Professor Kusakawa is shown opening the amado of his family's new house.

 Glazing them is a rather recent innovation, traditionally these also were papered over. However, the paper on them was much thicker and more resembled a cardstock. It was also commonly oiled or waxed to protect it from elements, yielding a sturdy, somewhat translucent material that is usually imitated by a milky glass now.

Engawa: Often loosely translated as "porch" or "veranda", the engawa is actually the strip of floor between the inner screens and the outer rain doors, which also serves as a kind of a corridor connecting all the rooms together. The engawa functions as a porch when the amado are open and a hallway when they're closed. A popular spot for eavesdroppers, or just a good place to hang out. Unlike the rooms, which have a tatami flooring, engawa usually has a wooden floor.

Furoba: The traditional Japanese bathroom, with a wash area and one or more soaking tubs. Not the toilet, however: that is almost always found in a separate alcove, either off the main bathroom or even in another part of the house.

Tatami: Traditional rice-straw floor mats, made in uniform sizes that vary from region to region, generally with length/width ratio 2:1. Room and even house sizes are often expressed in numbers of mats, a system referred to as Ken. Once commonly found throughout Japan, but nowadays typically only found in formal rooms, such as tea rooms, receiving rooms, and dojo.

 There are several different sizes of tatami, each characteristic to its region of origin. Largest of them are tatami from Kyoto, known as  While very warm and pleasant to sit and walk on, tatami actually have several disadvantages that make them significantly less practical than modern Western-style flooring. First, the are still largely hand-made and thus rather expensive  a single machine-made mat is about 20,000 yen (~200-250), and hand-made one may set you back for 100,000 yen (~$1000), but 18-man ones are not unheard of. Second, they are made from rice and soft rush straw (cheap modern tatami may have a pressed wood chip or fiberboard core or even a syntetic core of polystyrene instead of traditional rice straw) and wear out pretty quickly, especially if one walks on them in hard-soled shoes. A single mat in a heavily-walked area may last for a couple of years and then needs to be resurfaced (the core, on the other hand, is more or less eternal  there were tales of 80-years tatami). Third, being a rather loose assembly of pressed straw, tatami are pretty absorbent, and while it can be a good thing, they require a constant laborious care to remain sanitary  they need to be periodically aired and dried to rid them of the absorbed moisture and odors, and unless a particular care is taken, a lot of dust (and, unfortunately, insects) tends to settle Many modern Japanese still include one Washitsu or "Japanese" formal room featuring most of the traditional features listed above, even if the rest the house is yōshitsu (Western-style). Conversely, in the mid twentieth century it was common to include or add one western-style room to an otherwise Japanese style home.

Since Japanese houses are traditionally built on posts instead of foundations, the area under the floor is often easily accessible and is the traditional lurking spot for spies, sneaks, and ninjas. These post foundations are a key part of the relatively flexible structure which allows Japanese houses to withstand mild earthquakes without shaking to pieces.

Traditional Japanese houses also lack any form of central heating or air conditioning. Whatever heat the occupants may require is provided by a heater traditionally mounted on the bottom of the dining table known as a kotatsu: a sure sign that a kotatsu is in use is the equally traditional quilted skirt hung around the table to retain the heat. As for air conditioning, long eaves, big overhangs, and of course the sliding screens and amado, which allow the whole house to be opened up for natural ventilation (at some expense of privacy) reduce the need for artificial cooling.

And, of course, the garden is where you will find the thing that goes doink.
