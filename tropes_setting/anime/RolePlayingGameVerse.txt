A world straight out of a Role Playing Game. Some are adaptations of either computer rpgs or tabletop rpgs. Others were created independently, inspired by these games and their cultural ancestors.

Will use some, if not most, of the role-playing game terms, but how many obviously depends on the writers.

Often set in the time of myths or medieval european fantasy with any technology being lost technology or perhaps schizo tech. Compare rpg mechanics verse, when the characters themselves are aware of game mechanics.
