The two main Japanese religions are shinto (an animistic religion similar to (neo-)Paganism in the West) and buddhism. A lot of anime action takes place in Shinto shrines (jinja) and Buddhist temples (tera). Series with a supernatural bent may be set there for part or all of their action. More light-hearted slice of life series may feature the characters attending a festival such as Hatsumode (New Year's), possibly as part of a festival episode. Famous shrines and temples are also good destinations for a class trip.

You may or may not meet a miko at shrines. Shrines usually will also have shimenawa present.
