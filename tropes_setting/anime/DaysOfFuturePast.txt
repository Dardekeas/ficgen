A setting in which societies with futuristic technology have reverted to patterns from earlier time periods (e.g., medieval Europe, feudal Japan, nineteenth-century America) while remaining at a futuristic technological level (e.g., starships, humongous mecha, energy weapons). This can be either the result of relating historical metaphors to a future society, or an excuse to do a period piece in space.

This may also be an attempt to market a fantasy story as science fiction during a period where the latter is considered more fashionable. Just add applied phlebotinum which would pretty much be magic if not for the techno babble explaining it away as advanced science or psychic powers.

There are many variations on this trope (mainly because it makes making the fantasy counterpart cultures easier), but most can be broken down into just a few categories:

  Space Samurai: Future society resembles feudal Japan. Found as the local equivalent of  Contrast schizo tech. See also crystal spires and togas. Compare future imperfect.

For the sort of thing that appears on the Tales of Future Past website, see zeerust.

Despite the title of this page, this trope has nothing to do with the 1967 Moody Blues album  (where the title refers to, well, the present, specifically the course of a single day in a person's life), nor the X-Men time travel story arc Days of Future Past (although in the original run of the X-Men story, some of the background details imply a degree of technological regression, such as horses pulling a bus, and that timeline had certainly regressed in terms of social equality into an extreme level of segregation and eugenics) as well as the film adaptation of said comic that bears the same name.
