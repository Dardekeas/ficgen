the multiverse is a weird thing. Depending on the genre of the work, it can mean a dozen different things. But most sci-fi has a pretty clear definition of what a "Multiverse" is. For every decision someone makes, the universe diverges into several parallel dimensions, one for every possible choice. As such, there are a nearly infinite number of universes where every conceivable version of you (or the lack thereof) exists.

This is a problem for omnicidal maniacs. How can one possibly destroy all of reality if, somewhere, there is another reality where they fail? The answer is to find Earth Prime: If you find and destroy the original universe that all others diverged from, you can retroactively destroy all of them.

Related to expendable alternate universe. Compare cosmic keystone and no ontological inertia. Of course, there are time travel paradoxes and logic bombs abound in this theory, so it definitely requires some willing suspension of disbelief. Theoretically, the very act of doing that, would simply create ANOTHER infinite number of possibilities. Therefore, destroying everything should be impossible.

Warning: May be some spoilers ahead.
