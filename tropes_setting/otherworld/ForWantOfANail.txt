A story in which one small change has a ripple effect, resulting in massive changes.

Derives from a proverb-turned-poem which traces its origins as far back as the 14th century (making this older than print). Probably the most well-known version is the one which appeared in benjamin franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac:

A deal with the devil will often have the "nail" as a price, something of seemingly small consequence, that is in fact huge. In a series of disaster dominoes, the first domino often falls when the "nail" that props it up suddenly goes missing. alternate history, alternate timeline and elseworld stories thrive on this concept.

A sub-trope of what if?, and often a sub-trope of make wrong what once went right. A super trope of close enough timeline. If the originals meet their alternates, may result in other me annoys me or future me scares me. The it's a wonderful plot trope is a sub-trope of this itself. Often overlaps with in spite of a nail, because many stories wouldn't be that interesting if everything was different. Compare it began with a twist of fate.
