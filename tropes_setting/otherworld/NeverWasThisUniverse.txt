alternate history provides a method for creating a setting which is almost like our world, but varies in large enough ways that they couldn't plausibly actually be ours.

This trope covers settings which feel like alternate history in this way, but don't actually have a specified point of divergence: no matter how far back in history you look, their history has always been different from ours in some way (frequently, though not always, because it contains un-masqueraded fantasy elements). in spite of a nail is necessarily in effect, in order to keep the setting approximately similar to the real worldâ€”indeed, sometimes the histories of these settings are more different from reality than their presents.

Compare alien space bats; it's nearly always possible to retcon this sort of world into an alternate history with alien space bats, by adding in a point of divergence that's earlier than any other history you've introduced. Also compare historical fantasy. See also close enough timeline and rubber-band history. Contrast plausible deniability.
