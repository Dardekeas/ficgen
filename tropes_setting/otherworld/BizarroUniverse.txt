An alternate universe where everything is the same... but different. The Superman comics originated this, and it has been parodied by a number of shows.

A bizarro world is distinct from a normal alternate universe in that a bizarro world has everything "reversed" in some way. Heroes are villains and vice versa; beauty is hated and ugliness embraced. A good/evil flip is the usual trope, allowing the heroes to work together with the bizarro version of their enemies (who are, of course, heroes in bizarro world).

Recent examples of bizarro universes have reduced the use of good and evil in favor of other reversals, such as who is the 'smart one' in a group of friends or who are the 'cool kids' at school.

A bizarro universe need not be a literal "other universe"; sometimes it is simply another city/country/planet or a counterpart organisation that has strangely familiar elements, but with some sort of reversals present.

Occasionally, a bizarro world will have inverted language (eg: "badbye" instead of "goodbye"). This is usually not done, however, since the rules are very hard to follow and are often changed.

Compare opposite day, a similar idea on a much smaller scale. Compare mirror universe, which sometimes has some Bizarro elements to mix things up.
