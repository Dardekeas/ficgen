Protagonists who need to save the world in another dimension often find their original dimension endangered as well.

Maybe you're trapped in another world, fighting monsters and saving people so you can find your way home... and then you do. Or maybe you've gone to another world after adventuring around your home, and found something a little too familiar about this place. Maybe you even go between worlds on a regular basis, and things are getting serious on the other side.

Either way, you discover the two worlds you've been flitting about in have a strange connection. It doesn't matter what it is, but it let you into the other world, and it can let something else out into yours. Generally it's monsters roaming the streets, but there can be other effects. If the more mystical of the worlds is based in a computer realm, expect a deadly effect on your hometown hospitals and roads.

The other world's still in danger, but now so is yours, and the muggles certainly can't do anything about it. What do you do? You grab your adventuring party and a couple of friends from your homeworld, and you go out to save both worlds.

Contrast with up the real rabbit hole, where both worlds are in jeopardy but the heroes don't see the one that isn't their own as real enough to merit saving. May overlap with the call knows where you live.
