A common feature of alternate histories where the point-of-divergence is far enough back is that a mayincatec civilization has somehow survived to the present day, and now rules a large chunk of the Americas.

Like zeppelins from another world, generally done as a throwaway "Look how different this world is" detail, without any serious or detailed consideration of how it happened or what the geopolitical effects were. (Possibly correlated with alternate worlds where the technology level never got high enough for zeppelins.)

Incidentally, in real life, there are pockets of Mayans, Aztecs and Incans who still practice their old traditions - while the ruling class were deposed, not all of the peasants were completely assimilated.

If it's the focus of the story, subtrope of alternate history wank.
