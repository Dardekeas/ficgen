A constructed world is a completely fictional setting, rather than our world in the future, another planet in our galaxy, or an alternate history. The heroes of its stories are usually the locals, who neither have nor need a connection with our present-day Earth.

This world might be built from standard components, but there is deliberate world building going on. It may or may not have a fantasy world map.

As one of the most common fantasy settings, some form of functional magic is typically present, but this isn't required: constructed worlds exist that have little or no magic. Most high fantasy takes place in constructed worlds, as well as a great deal of low fantasy and heroic fantasy.

Compare a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away..., which is used more in science fiction but usually has the same effect. Contrast magical land, where the focus is on visitors to the setting and like reality unless noted. earth all along is a subversion of this trope.
