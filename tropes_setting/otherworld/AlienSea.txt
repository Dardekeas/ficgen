One of the quickest, easiest ways to establish an alien world as being very unlike Earth is to make its "water" some wacky colour, or give it some other unusual features or appearance. It's not always explained exactly what kind of chemicals or minerals are causing it to look this way, but regardless, it's still perfectly able to support the native flora and fauna (though that doesn't mean it is safe for earthlings).

See also alien sky, which serves the same purpose and may accompany it - note that Earth's oceans mostly just reflect the colour of the sky, so if the sky and sea don't match you must be someplace exceptionally alien.

 Earth can give the impression of not being itself in places, too:

 Fairly recently, in 1980-90s palaeontologists asked themselves: what were the ancient seashores like? Real ancient, pre-Cambrian and early Palaeozoic. Current consensus is that without higher plants wind and water erosion went really fast, and land was very flat low plains with occasional vertical rocks. There was no such thing as riverbeds, water flowed into seas as an even layer all over the shoreline. Sediments were carried far into the sea, resulting in far stretches of shallow waters. There was no distinct border between sea and dry land, no shoreline, just kilometres of shallow pools and mud, that got slightly wetter at high tide. Creatures like modern mudskippers would thrive in such environment.
