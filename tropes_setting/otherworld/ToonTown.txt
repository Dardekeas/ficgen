cartoons are not real. They're made with art supplies and brought to life by animators and voice actors. it's sad but it's true.Hey, wait a minute! We seem to have made a wrong turn at albu-coiky! Now we're in Toon Town, that very special district of fantasy Land where cartoon characters are people, just like you and me. Sometimes, they exist as a separate and independent species, and sometimes, the place itself transforms humans into toons. But all details aside, Toon Town is a loony sort of place where cartoon physics and the rule of funny reign supreme. Expect the roger rabbit effect almost every time.

Not to be confused with the mmorpg, Toon Town Online.
