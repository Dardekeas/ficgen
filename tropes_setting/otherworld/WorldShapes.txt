Since the most prominent force in shaping a molten proto-object large enough to later be called a planet is gravity, worlds in real life tend to be roughly spherical in shape. This is also why there is a direct relationship between the size of a lump of rock floating through space and its degree of roundness.

However, some speculative fiction and fantasy series, in order to drive home the point that they do not take place anywhere resembling Earth, have their heroes adventuring on a planet with a totally different and often quite improbable shape.

Common world shapes:

       A twist on this is video game geography, type 1, where the world doesn't actually have an odd shape, but the way the programmers implemented the world map implies that it does.

Interestingly, when "Planet" was given a formal definition (thus demoting Pluto), "big enough to be spherical from its own gravity" became one of the requirements, so any non-sphere planet is not a planet (of course, any such body being discovered in the real universe has a solid chance of leading to a change in definition)
