Since medieval stasis makes it so that a magical land will always be the same, and that 1,000 or so years in their world has the same amount of political, economic, and technological development as about five years in our world - that means that natural change happens pretty much never. Including geological shift. The continents, landmarks, etc. will remain in the exact same way they are across a span of 10,000 years, so the prophecy about the sealed evil in a can in the Mountains of Shadowblood Peak will always be fulfilled without having Shadowblood Peak turn into the Shadowblood Picnic Hills thanks to erosion.

With one exception: world sundering. Used as part of expansion pack world, or a cosmic retcon to justify revamping an outdated setting, the world sundering is a huge magical explosion that does the job of millions of years of geological shift in a few seconds. Generally, an evil wizard, an artifact of doom, or some other event causes all of the continents of the world to shift rapidly.

This allows writers to set two stories ten years apart in a world that's completely different from the old one.

Geological change in these worlds doesn't happen because of tectonic plates or any nonsense like that. a wizard did it. Always.
