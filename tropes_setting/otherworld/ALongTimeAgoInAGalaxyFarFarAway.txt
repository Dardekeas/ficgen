space is big. really, really big. So big in fact, that most of it can't even be seen from the Earth. So what exactly is out there? This trope is what happens when writers try to answer that question.

A galaxy far, far away is a setting for a story which is so far away from Earth, that the very fact of its distance lends an air of credibility to even the most fantastic of plots. After all, no one really knows what's out there in the vastness of space. There may be elements we've never heard of. The laws of physics may not work the same way. There may be space gods, ancient civilizations, rubber-forehead aliens, all kinds of applied phlebotinum. Just about anything is fair game, because no one can prove that a given aspect of the story is impossible.

One doesn't actually have to give too much detail about their corner of the void to invoke this trope. They don't even have to make direct reference to the Earth. If a story takes on a planet that's clearly not Earth, and Earth is never mentioned, it will usually just be assumed that the planet in question is so far away that they've never heard of Earth. If the writer feels a need to explain why most of the characters are human or everyone seems to speak English, they may include some vague reference to a "theoretical ancestor planet", or translation convention may be invoked. If they don't even try to explain it, then it's probably an unimportant coincidence.

The trope namer is, of course,  A New Hope, although that movie was actually adapting an old fairy tale trope of setting a story "in a far away land" to similar effect, making this trope older than they think.
