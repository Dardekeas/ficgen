It's common for world building writers to hand wave the agricultural practices of their fictional planet, lost world or fantasy culture. When mentioned at all, often this topic will be minimized by letting virtually all of an invented society's needs be met by just one or two domestic crops, or a single kind of livestock. If a plant's roots can be eaten half a dozen ways, its stems burned for fuel, its leaves converted into textiles and its sap brewed into alcohol, it's this trope. Likewise, if the dominant livestock is an easily-reared explosive breeder that (conveniently) supplies all the dietary needs of a population on its own.

The agricultural equivalent of green rocks. If this particular crop/livestock's production is the foundation for an entire culture, it can help define a planet of hats or one-product planet, possibly resulting in a terminally dependent society. May be an indication of current or lost organic technology within the setting. soylent soy may be an example, if derived from a single crop species rather than blending two or more.
