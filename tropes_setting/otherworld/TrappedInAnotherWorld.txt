A standard plot/myth arc for speculative fiction: The ordinary high-school student, frequently his friends, and sometimes his enemies are all transported (often summoned) to another world — distant planet, a magical land, alternate universe, the past, the future — where they find they have an important role to play in Events of Significance that are occurring at the same time as (or sometimes because of) their arrival. Usually there is no hope of their finding a means to return home until after the great threat facing them has been defeated; occasionally, they will then question whether they even want to leave (they typically do).

This type of plot device is extremely popular in crossover fanfiction.

A blend of fish out of water and failure is the only option, with a large dash of heroism. The inverse of alien among us. Often overlaps with down the rabbit hole and you can't go home again. If it's the hero's job to bring back the trapped person, it's an orphean rescue, if someone else turns up to bring back the hero it's weirdness search and rescue. May involve fantastic romance. In literature this is often referred to as a portal fantasy.
