There's space western for the west , and there's cattle punk for The West meets steam punk. The Weird West is the sister trope, for when The West meets the supernatural.

The West is, if you think about it, a logical choice for this treatment. The frontier as a whole was traditionally viewed (and still is viewed, to some extent) as the meeting place of civilization and the unknown. The lawless setting also meant plenty of violent deaths and unfinished business, fuel for ghostly tales. The magical native american cliché also tends to show up here, for obvious reasons.

Weird West works often invoke horror tropes. Ghosts, zombies, vampires, and werewolves are common elements. Also expect to see some elements from Native American mythology such as the wendigo. The West also has its own cryptids and urban legends, the most famous of them being the chupacabra. It is not unknown for an ongoing Western series to have an episode or two of weirdness — even if ambiguously.

And yes, Weird West is an industry term. wikipedia uses the term to describe any work where the western is fused with a different genre.
