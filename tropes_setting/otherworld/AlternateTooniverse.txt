A subtrope of alternate universe where the AU is inhabited by cartoon characters. Exists alongside a universe like ours inhabited by flesh and blood human beings. Usually toons and humans are treated as separate species, if they interact. Humans may be fearful of Toons because of their different abilities. Note, however, that to whom, where, and when toon physics apply depends on the work, and frequently on the rule of funny.

Comes in two flavors:

 Type I: Like our world, only with cartoon characters interacting with real live people.

 Type II: An alternate (or parallel) universe exists alongside our world, and it is populated by cartoon characters. There is often travel between this world and one much like our own.
