You've used the time travel machine on "random", "borrowed" the professor's rocket ship, or walked through the strange glowy doorway. OK, everything seems normal, but for some reason you can't get your bearings. When you look up... it's an Alien Sky.

Maybe there are two moons. Perhaps Earth's all-too-familiar moon, the one in all the love songs, is broken into so many pieces it's become a ring of debris around the planet. Or the sky is dominated by an huge gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, suggesting you are in fact, technically, on the moon. The sun is a different colour, or has a little and a bigger brother. The daytime sky is a lovely shade of deep purple. The nighttime sky is empty. Maybe the sky is simply home to cloudforms that are not of this world... or lifeforms. Or rocks.

Such things serve as an obvious visual means of showing the audience that the characters are in another world! Sometimes used to comedic effect when our heroes just won't believe they've left Earth for good, and shrug off all other, often painfully obvious, hints as some kind of masquerade ("Wow, great special effects! I'm on hidden camera, right?").

Likely to be paired with an alien sea.

A super trope to binary suns, bad moon rising, the stars are going out and several others. Compare zeppelins from another world.
