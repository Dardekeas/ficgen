Sometimes a writer creates a universe almost exactly the same as ours, but with slight differences. Some settings refer to not just one other dimension, but to a whole set of other dimensions and universes. A system of distinct worlds exists, often interconnected in a way that allows characters to travel to and from them. It might be as a tourist who just goes to look and tries not to change anything, or as a participant who goes in and interacts with the people in the other universe.

dimensional travelers can move between universes and explore the multiverse. While it is possible they don't have a choice in their destination, sometimes they do. There are a wide variety of interdimensional travel devices available but the most common are gates or magic.

In some occasions it's the way for a creator to tie several different works via canon welding, or to justify a crossover.

This provides all sorts of interesting ideas for things you can do, for good or bad. If it involves trans-universe sex tourism, you have "your universe or mine?" (or screw yourself sometimes). However, beware evil twin, and similar beings.

Sometimes, the Multiverse is protected by a guardian of the multiverse. The multiversal conqueror, on the other hand, wants to conquer or destroy it.

Not the same thing as alternate continuity, but it makes a handy way to link them if the writers are so inclined. See also bizarro universe, another dimension and alternate universe. Compare rubber-band history.

For works set in the same universe, see the verse.
