Due to some applied phlebotinum, a character is pulled or travels from literature or screen into the real world. Possibly you let your bungling inventor fix your remote, or maybe the Fantasy adventurers found a portal pool to a strange new world. Either way, they're here, and they're gonna cause trouble.

Whatever the circumstances, as well as possibly being the ultimate fish out of water, they'll likely be from a land riddled with cliched tropes, and have contractual genre blindness. Their world works on well established rules but this is reality, in all its chaos, and it doesn't even seem to have a coherent storyline! Usually hilarity ensues.

Then of course, there are those things that stories conveniently skip over like finding parking space, breakfast, feeling tired, irrelevant conversations, bathroom trips, car insurance. The character is often from a highly sanitized storyline where things like that just don't happen.

Oh, and there's a fair chance you'll have to get them back home somehow.

A refugee from tv land is a good way to show up fictional differences between fiction and reality, and play up tropes as it does so. The fact that the "real" characters never seem to go to the bathroom either is one of those things you're not meant to think about.

When the characters come from the past or the future, this trope overlaps with fish out of temporal water.

Will probably overlap with batman in my basement. Often quietly implies that all fiction is real somewhere. Can be paired with a reading is cool aesop. The opposite, and often connected plot, is trapped in tv land. See also real world episode and roger rabbit effect.
