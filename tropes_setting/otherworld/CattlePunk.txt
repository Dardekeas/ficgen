Let's face it. Cowboys are awesome. the western used to qualify as their own genre so many of them used to be made. The thing is, in the modern world, science fiction is much more high-brow. And yet the awesome allure of cowboys cannot be ignored. Solution? steam punk meets the western.

A setting which otherwise more or less resembles your typical john ford film will have things like robots, super-weapons, and wacky gadgets tossed in. Interestingly, the heroes of such stories are usually pretty normal considering the setting- they'll use weapons like pistols and shotguns to take down warmechs.

This kind of plot usually takes place either on another planet or in a very obvious alternate history, since making it work on Earth seriously messes up the space time continuum.

This setting is unusual among the punk punk subtropes in that it actually predates steam punk, which is generally considered the ur-trope. For this we can thank The Wild Wild West, which pioneered the genre by thinking in terms of the western meets spy drama- which, in practice, ends up looking a lot like steam punk.

Expect ample schizo tech in this setting. This a bit of a variation on the in space! model, though characters here rarely ever actually go into space, at least for extended periods of time.

See the inversion, space western. A related genre is the weird west, for when the west gets a supernatural treatment.

Not to be confused with Cowpunk, a form of music combining (you guessed it!) Country and Punk, which existed mainly in the 1980s. Although a Cattle Punk movie with a Cowpunk soundtrack would be a good idea.
