A device that allows travel between dimensions/alternate universes/planes of existence/etc. This device could be anything, from a machine in science fiction to a magical item in fantasy, as long as it allows travel between these dimensions or realities. It could even be a human (or, at the very least, a sentient being), if they have the power to go to these other "places".
