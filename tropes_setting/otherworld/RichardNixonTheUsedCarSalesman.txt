Sometimes writers of counterfactual stories decide to disregard plausibility in order to throw in their stories cameos by historical figures from our own timeline, but in a totally different occupation. Usually this is done as something of an in-joke with the audience or the dimension-hopping character(s); seeing adolf hitler as a starving artist instead of the tyrannical dictator he was in real life would tickle anyone's funnybone. As a point of clarification, Nixon's parents owned a gas station, which makes a job dealing with cars understandable for a less successful/ambitious alternate Nixon. Similarly, Adolf Hitler actually aspired to be an artist prior to getting into politics; he was an avid fan of disney and rejected by an art school. That said, the cameo doesn't need to have a root in history, but it's more fun if they do.
