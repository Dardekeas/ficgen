One way for authors to subtly (or overtly) convey and reinforce the mood of a scene, episode, or even the genre of the work is to make the environment symbolize it. Much like a character with an astonishingly appropriate appearance, a setting can be made rife with environmental symbolism to play up the emotional theme at work.

Generally, the whole setting itself will reflect the overall mood of the show, while a special location for a given scene will display the current mood of the characters.

To do this, expect to see the following manipulated: Color:  Lighting:  Space: Claustrophobia, Agoraphobia

 Time:  Cleanliness:  Construction Era:  Inhabitants: The kind of plants, animals and people present, or their  Weather: Note that the setting itself will not actively or supernaturally change unless the characters change it. Whether it's urban renewal to uplift or massive battle damage and craters depends on what the author wants. "Natural" changes such as the lights going dead or a fire breaking out do count towards this trope however.

See also poster-gallery bedroom, where the character's in-universe design choices for their living space reflect their personality.

Related tropes are: fisher king, genius loci, and basically everything in settings.
