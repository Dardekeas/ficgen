This world is actually quite okay, at least by standards that can be expected by the audience. However, it is very much a matter of perspective whether a certain world is a crapsack world or a utopia. And thus, sometimes a character or cast of characters are faced with a world that is awful for them without being particularly bad in itself.

These characters might come from a world where boredom, lies, poverty or even death itself simply doesn't exist. When they encounter a world just like ours (and a rather kind version of it at that), it looks horrifying in comparison. In some cases, they learn to appreciate this new world after awhile. In others, they remain repulsed by it.

If the character is unbalanced enough, this could possibly lead to him wanting to put them all out of my misery.

Compare life will kill you and humans are the real monsters. deliberate values dissonance and culture clash are bound to come into play.
