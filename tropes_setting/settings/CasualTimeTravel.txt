A setting where time-traveling is common place. Having a time machine is nothing special. These are no longer "prototypes" or dangerous, unique devices made by a handful of mad scientists. No, they are common items, mass-produced (though perhaps of restricted availability). It is like owning a car, or, at most, like taking a vacation. Time travel has long been mastered and integrated in society, and no doubt there are businesses specialized in time travel for fun and profit. There might be a time police enforcing the rules â€” in fact, time police almost always come from a setting with this trope.
