A type of landscape featuring natural formations that are the functional equivalents of theme park rides: Waterfalls, mountain torrents, glaciers or icebergs double as water slides, plot-sensitive erosion has created rock or snow formations that act as rollercoaster tracks or bobsled runs, complete with ramp jumps, giant water lilies serve as trampolines or at least provide a fun and bouncy way to cross a stretch of water, hanging vines can be used as ropeways, swings, for bungee-jumping or Tarzan-style transportation and so on...

Alternatively, the setting can be industrial or urban, as long as the environment invites misuse as a carnival ride. This can be both benevolent architecture or malevolent architecture, depending on your viewpoint and if you liked the "ride" or intended to take it in the first place.
