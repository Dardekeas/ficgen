The French Foreign Legion is one of the most mythologized military units in the world. Its most famous writer was P.C. Wren but it has had other writers and it has been occasionally spoofed, notably by charles schulz. It is legendary as a place where people with a mysterious past go to disappear, and of course bereaved lovers, political refugees, and various rogues and scoundrels and the like can always be found there.

The actual Legion existed to provide a body of cannon fodder who can fight in dangerous and distant lands without risking the lives of (many) actual French citizens, though in recent years it took the role of a far smaller, elite infantry unit, completed with a light armor regiment.

French citizenship is often the reward for a Legionnaire who has completed five years of service.

The stereotypical Legionnaire in fiction is represented as a member of a North African campaign from approximately 1900-1950. They are always depicted wearing white khepis while standing guard at lonely outposts in the Sahara. In real life, the Legion operates in a variety of environments and conflicts (such as French Indochina) and wears camouflage as needed. One of their real-life current deployments is to serve as the security detail for the European Space Agency's space launch facility at Kourou, French Guyana. (the European Union's counterpart to Cape Canaveral).
