A place, be it a nation, colony, city, special district or the cafe on the border of gang territory, where neutrality is the operating principle. Unlike the neutral zone or a demilitarized zone where members of the opposing side risk being shot if they enter, the Truce Zone actively encourages people of all stripes to visit and do business. Having shooting break out in a truce zone between opposing sides is bad for business and is strictly discouraged, often forcefully by the local law. Or everyone else will just mob you.

Some Truce Zones refer to themselves as a "free city", a region not controlled by the empire, the federation or any other nation state. A frequently seen aspect of these places is that they are centers for trade and commerce and may have laws favoring businesses that might wish to establish themselves there. Such places often conveniently fail to have extradition agreements with the big players. Many free city Truce Zones take this further and allow businesses and people of questionable nature to exist there as long as they don't cause trouble for the place, making it a wretched hive attractive to criminal elements and bounty hunters as well as protagonists fleeing the government for more heroic reasons. Anyone who enters the free city and obeys the truce rules can expect equal protection by local law enforcement, so this is a relatively safe place for fugitives.

Sister trope of holy ground. Contrast the neutral zone, which despite sounding the same, is actually the opposite â€” instead of both sides coexisting, neither side is allowed entry. Often combined with city of spies, hub city, vice city (in the seedier ones), and good guy bar. Sometimes includes (or is) a bazaar of the bizarre or inn between the worlds. May well include a power nullifier and/or anti-magic field for added security and deterrence; after all, Mr Joe Bulletproof is much less likely to start a fight if he's not so bulletproof after all.
