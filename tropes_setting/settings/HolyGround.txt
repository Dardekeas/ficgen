a place that has religious significance. It could be the site of a church or temple, a graveyard, a holy city, or any other place. There are rules you must follow, taboos you must not break, or the locals will object, if not the one that place was dedicated to. After all, holy is not safe.

If someone is seeking sanctuary, this is the place they'll go. If this place actively repels or harms evil forces, then it is a place of protection because holy burns evil.
