An artificial structure in space, where people live and work. Unlike the cool starship, the Space Station is usually fixed in orbit around a planet or at a particular point in space. It also allows for the construction of a standing studio set and avoids expensive location shoots.

Real-world space stations have existed since 1971 (Salyut 1) and 3 of them—the International Space Station, and Genesis I & II (both unmanned)—are currently in orbit. These are all much smaller than what one is used to in sci-fi shows. The list for the interested can be seen below.

Space stations in fiction have a tendency to be very large, sometimes housing an entire city. Many have adopted a wheel design for a centrifuge-based system of gravity (unless artificial gravity is employed), but this is not obligatory. If sufficiently large to support a sizable permanent population, a space-station may be referred to as an "orbital habitat" or "space colony". don't drop it! The problem of gas exchange and food production is often solved by incorporating a closed ecosystem and green plants onboard, sometimes in dirt, sometimes hydroponics, sometimes algae aquaculture.
