'New Age' defines a constellation of beliefs that peaked in popularity in the '60s and '70s. Expect lots of crystal power, psychic dolphins, atlantis, pyramids, good vibes, reincarnation, quantum consciousness and, above all, the Age of Aquarius, the funkiest, highest-vibration-in-the-spectrum Age of them all!

Enemy of all that is bogus, mechanoid or square, friend to the chilled-out and open minded.

Rarely depicted without tongue firmly in cheek in actual Aquarian Age media.

Also the name for a kind of music. Very calm, peaceful, and deep, man. It often features a mix of electronic ambient with World Music instruments and occasional vocals, singing something illegible in dog latin, Polynesian or Lakotah. "New Age Music" is more of a marketing term than any real connection to beliefs, however. Most of "new age" artists just play what music they like, and some are even angry about the term.
