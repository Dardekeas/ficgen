In Western fiction, this may not differ much from depictions of modern africa. Depictions may also reference African mythology. Although in the less-politically-correct past the "savage with the bone in his nose stuffing the pith-helmeted explorer into a cooking pot" image was quite prevalent. Going back even further, when the Ancient Greeks referred to Africa they tended to focus on Egypt or Ethiopia as mystical, exotic lands.

In reality, Africa has a history as stocked full of rising and falling empires, artists, intrepid merchants, heroes, power-mad lunatics and wars as anywhere else in the world.
