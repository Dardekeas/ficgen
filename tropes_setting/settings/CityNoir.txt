The localized, urban version of a crapsack world. apathetic citizens shuffle though a maze of overbearing black skyscrapers and sinister subways as sirens wail constantly in the background. Expect a very limited color palette, a palpable air of decay and depression, and an unbelievable crime rate.

Usually, cities like this will consist of a downtown area full of corrupt corporate executives surrounded by a massive wretched hive.

It will often be informed by Taxi Driver-era new york (sinister clouds of steam emerging from the sewers, prostitutes on every corner, depressive knights in sour armor narrating about how crappy the place is, etc.), though the origins of City Noir are actually in german expressionism. It may take these things to surreal lengths.

If our story takes place in the future, it will be a dystopia full of hideously tacky black star scrapers (symbolizing class oppression) and other signs of a future gone wrong. If it takes place in the past, the City Noir of choice will probably either be industrial revolution-era london or a fantasy counterpart version of it. Facsimiles of cities like New York and Chicago during the Great Depression might alternately pop up, although for American audiences they may well be shot through the nostalgia filter.

Cities Noir often enjoy twenty hour nights and constant cloud cover. The remaining four hours of daylight are given over to two hours of rain, one hour of thunder, one hour of sunsets. Sunrises usually mean the work set here is ending.

These places are a staple of film noir and darker and edgier shows.

A sister trope to soiled city on a hill, vice city, and wretched hive. The shining city is the antithesis. See also the city narrows and the big rotten apple which is what you get when you cross City Noir with the big applesauce trope. See cyberpunk with a chance of rain for the cyber punk City Noir weather forecast.
