The fictional university used by many high school TV shows to extend their lives into the college years. The name "California University" was used by both Saved by the Bell and Beverly Hills 90210, but the term can be applied to any university that allows an ensemble high school show to retain the majority of its cast.

The university is often located within a reasonable distance to the original high school, to allow or imply limited interaction with the parents and old shopkeepers; egregious cases will have the old faculty follow the students to the university — if they were sufficiently a part of the old cast — which makes no sense whatsoever. Despite the fact that the original high school show depicted the cast as a wide range of academic talent, ranging from slacker to valedictorian, all of the principal cast members of the show apply, are accepted, and elect to go to the same university — and often take the same courses.

Often a case of california doubling, in which the UCLA campus, or less often, those of USC or Loyola Marymount University, serves as a convenient shooting location for los angeles-based productions. A case of truth in television, given that the Golden State has the largest and best-known public higher education system in the United States. (See Real Life below).
