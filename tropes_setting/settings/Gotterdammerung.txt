Götterdämmerung - German for "Twilight of the Gods"

The term was popularized by richard wagner in his Der Ring des Nibelungen opera cycle. This is a German translation of the Old Norse "Ragnarökkr" ("twilight of the gods"), which was itself a poetic alternate name for the norse term Ragnarök: The "ragna" part (nominative: regin) means "gods" or "the powers" while "rök" has several meanings like "fate", "development", "relation", "cause" and suprisingly "origin".

Ragnarok was the story of how most of the aesir and the greatest jotuns died in a battle against each other. Similarly, this trope refers to when the gods or sufficiently advanced precursors of a story (and possibly their enemies) either die (if they are mortal) or are sealed in a can (if they are immortal), usually in a large battle or some other sudden event. Frequently, this is the end result of a war between gods.

Contrast death of the old gods, where the gods are either slowly disappearing or losing popularity / being replaced over a period of time, essentially going out with a whisper instead of a bang. Also, compare the magic goes away. See also end of an age / dawn of an era, which this trope may end up leading to.
