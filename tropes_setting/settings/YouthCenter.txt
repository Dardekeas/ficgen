So you've got free-range children. And it's not the fifties. How are we to keep them from a life of crime?

Enter Youth Center. a stock setting since the 70s. Kids go here to have fun. A typical youth center will be like a club, except without the alcohol or all the gay kids. It may also have a rec room. But in fiction, youth centers have new features as the plot demands. Gyms, movie screens, and restaurants are just a few examples.

But, like christmas, youth centers are always threatened. (This is sort of truth in television, as these places often have no budget in real life.) So it works as a macguffin too.
