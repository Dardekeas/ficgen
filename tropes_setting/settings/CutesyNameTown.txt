quirky town, with eccentric townsfolk, only there's an adorable name attached to the town as well. Usually some kind of joke/pun is attached to the name. A town with crazy people has some kind of crazy-themed name, a place dedicated to romance will have some romantic name, etc. Frequently seen in a romance novel.

Beware; sometimes the cutesy name hides a town with a dark secret. Contrast i don't like the sound of that place.
