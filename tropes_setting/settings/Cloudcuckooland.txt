All cultures are to be treated with equal respect. This is a modern educational tendency brought about by anthropology and cultural relativity, and in modern TV land, by and large, even when dealing with completely fictional culture, this is a rule that's pretty well adhered to.

The one big exception to this is Cloudcuckooland. This is a place with some really strange customs and traditions. While a fish out of water or an unforgiving viewer might just instantly assume that mental illness must be involved when they land in an unfamiliar location and everyone just acts strange for no reason, all doubts are laid aside once the reality of this location sets in. In Cloudcuckooland, everyone acts like a culturally out-of-it nutjob, even when they're talking to each other about completely mundane things. When in Cloudcuckooland, survival in the cultural environment relies on one strict observance—as far as everybody here is concerned, you're the one who's really crazy!

Or, to be simple, this is the place where the cloudcuckoolander lives. It's the only place in fiction where being a Cloudcuckoolander is happenstance—in these environments, the characters you remember are going to be the normal ones.

The unusual trope name is a translation of "Nephelokokkygia" from aristophanes' play The Birds. However, Aristophanes' Cloudcuckooland was not actually an "odd place", but a fictional paradise state where everything is perfect — and which, therefore, doesn't exist. Accordingly, a "Cloudcuckoolander" was someone demented or naive enough to believe in such an impossible place.

Compare hufflepuff house, where most of a story's "wacky" characters that are neither cool nor "draco in leather pants" enough to become ensemble darkhorses are usually lumped together and given a place to play.
