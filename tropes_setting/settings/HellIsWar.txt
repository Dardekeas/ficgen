war is hell. So what better way to punish your foes than to make them fight forever?

Basically, a scenario in which a character (or characters) in fiction is forced to fight indefinitely, usually as a form of karmic death. It doesn't necessarily have to be an afterlife.

The defining characteristics of the trope are:

 Characters are somehow imprisoned and made to fight

 Death is not an option for escape

Depending on how bad the punishment is, this can be used symbolically to support the argument that war is a terrible thing. A common subversion/inversion is for the "punished" character to enjoy the violence. sealed evil in a duel is a sub-trope.

Contrast warrior heaven, where getting to fight forever is your reward.
