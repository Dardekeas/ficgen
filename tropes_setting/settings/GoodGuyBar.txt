The heroic alternative of the bad-guy bar, the good guy bar is a place where heroes and do-gooders go to unwind after hours. Since the heroes might normally be on different squads or teams, the Good Guy Bar allows heroes who don't normally meet to do so, whether to talk shop or simply commiserate with like-minded peers.

Unlike the bad-guy bar, a Good Guy Bar can come in a wide variety of forms, whether a stereotypical seedy dive (complete with pool hall), a posh nightclub or a five-star restaurant. The more elegant locations will be used when the author wants to emphasize (or otherwise play with) the virtuous nature of the heroes. If the good guy bar spans time and space, it may double as an inn between the worlds.

Many Good Guy Bars have an implicit agreement to allow villains to patronize, so long as they don't start trouble Â— after all, tolerance is traditionally a heroic virtue. Such places will have a strictly enforced neutrality agreement to keep everyone from fighting each other. The lowest form might be bad guy bars whose powerful proprietors enforce no-violence truce zones.

See you all meet in an inn for when this sort of establishment serves as the jumping-off point for an adventure. Subtrope to local hangout.
