When the future doesn't seem all that futuristic and different from what a modern person would be used to, a setting may be stuck in a modern stasis. Maybe a show that's mostly about family life in the present day has a flash forward, time skip, or distant finale and gets in way over its head. Maybe a science fiction setting bears an uncanny resemblance to the present day despite being set way more than twenty minutes into the future. In any case, things change much less than they really ought to.

Often happens during a distant finale. Not to be confused with next sunday a.d., where the time gap is realistically short. Compare with medieval stasis, which is more common in fantasy settings. The polar opposite of the singularity. Usually goes hand in hand with sci-fi writers have no sense of scale, no new fashions in the future and kinetic weapons are just better. zeerust is when this trope is especially blatant.
