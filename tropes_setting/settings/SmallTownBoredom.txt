A teenager growing up in a small rural town wants to get away from it all, to the big city, or abroad, anywhere but the boring old Small Town. Characters that come from this background, such as the country mouse and farm boy, generally jump at the call. If they don't, expect the call to come looking for them anyway.

Compare and contrast with nothing exciting ever happens here and hated hometown. Related to grass is greener, which is about someone in bad conditions dreaming of going to a better place. Often seen in stories set in dying towns, perhaps ones with small town rivalry.

Often, however, leads to an aesop about home sweet home and appreciating what you've got. A common subtype is leaving the close-knit community and finding that apathetic citizens are much worse.

When this happens in a musical, expect a somewhere song or a wanderlust song.
