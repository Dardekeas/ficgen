So you've died and death isn't cheap. Luckily, you led a good life and go to Heaven. It's perfect in nearly every way, except for one thing. And that one thing makes Heaven damn near Hell.

It's not about Heaven being bad in general, it's about how things are bad for one person. For example, maybe Heaven has a strict No Pets Allowed policy. While for some people being in a place with animal-less Christians would be wonderful, others may miss their pet. Another possibility is that their significant other is in hell; they may think it's worse than being down there with them. Anyway, heaven without them is "a hell of heaven".

Of course, one of the most common complaints against fluffy cloud heaven is that it would be soul-crushingly boring. Especially when even the tiniest amounts of free thought and pleasure carry huge risks of sin.

In this trope the actual heaven is horrible in their view, so do not confuse it with this isn't heaven! Compare infernal paradise for when it's only horrible for outsiders to the faith and contrast a hell of a time for when hell is fun for a specific person.
