One of the oldest stories in speculative fiction: Beings from space come to Earth to conquer.

There are a few ways this can go: The All-Out Attack. Technologically superior forces aim their weapons of war and  The Infiltration. Aliens are replacing,  A combination of the above, with an infiltration paving the way for an all-out attack.

Sometimes, there are good aliens that help us against the invaders; unfortunately, they tend to be much weaker and/or less numerous, since if they were equally or more powerful, the focus would be taken off humanity. Then there's the benevolent alien invasion, where the invaders are the good aliens.

Often an allegory for some Earth-based conflict, either one that's happened in the past or one that people fear may happen. The Infiltration is especially popular as a metaphor for Communism.

This trope, in its modern form, was created by h. g. wells's novel The War of the Worlds. It was actually a variation on another theme popular at the time, the "invasion story", where another country's army, usually France or Germany (depending on who relations were worse with at the time), would try to conquer Britain. then world war i happened. Today, similar themes are found in techno-thrillers, and crop up in works like Red Dawn (1984) and The Tomorrow Series.

A common tomato surprise nowadays is for the invaders to be human.
