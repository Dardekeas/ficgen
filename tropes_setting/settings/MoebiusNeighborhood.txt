The neighbours. Sometimes, they're annoying, sometimes they're helpful, sometimes they just drop by way too often. Whether good or bad, however, one thing is fairly certain: If you're living in TV land, you've only got one set of 'em. Almost as if the rules of space-time somehow didn't apply to this neighbourhood, resulting in a house that's actually only got one side... or a block with only two lots on it, so only two houses border each other. However, in that case there would still be other nearby houses across the streets, so if it seems like there is only one other named family in the entire neighborhood then this trope is in full force.

The reasoning behind this trope is fairly simple: keeping down the number of characters that the audience has to remember, and thus the number of actors you have to hire, and even the number of sets you have to maintain, in the case of a live-action tv-series.Sometimes, the "other" neighbours may make a brief, single-episode appearance, only to be promptly forgotten again. And no, this trope has nothing to do with president moebius. And given the large cast of the Sonic games, the neighborhoods in Moebius are probably not Moebius Neighborhoods.
