Technically referred to as dimensional transcendence, an unusual fact of some architecture in fiction is that no matter how small it is on the outside, on the inside it can be any size it darned well pleases. All you have to do is simply walk into an ordinary 1960s london police call box and you're in a space that dwarfs most Gothic cathedrals.

This might be a sight gag, but equally it may be done for technical reasons, such as in early video games, where fixed-size background tiles may cause furnished interiors to become larger than the plain exterior suggests.

There may or may not be an in-universe explanation, typically involving some sort of pocket dimension relativisation of space-time, applied phlebotinum or simply magic.

Being bigger on the inside is not just limited to architecture such as buildings and other physical structures. Within media it can also apply to living creatures with incredibly spacious internal anatomy that characters who enter it eventually discover. Usually if terrestrial in origin, and not otherworldly or supernatural, then artistic license - biology has been employed. If extraterrestrial, then its simply a case of bizarre alien biology at work.

Compare with clown car, a common sight gag, and clown car base, which is when we never see the inside. Also compare units not to scale, perspective magic. Contrast misleading package size. Often overlaps with alien geometries. A subtrope is oh look, more rooms!, in which rooms keep opening up further and further in, rather than blowing you away with a giant hall on first glance. See also hammerspace and bag of holding for the variant where there is more storage on the inside.

Curiously, it is exceedingly rare to invert this trope's literal phrasing, and exclaim "It's smaller on the outside!" You'd have thought it would take less than 49 years for this inversion to be applied to the TARDIS, but you'd be wrong.
