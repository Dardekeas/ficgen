In space based sci-fi universes, whenever we may see the distant past or future (relative to the original setting), the technology present never seems to be any more or less advanced, no matter how far you go in either direction. Even if itÂ’s hundreds of years, they still have the same warp drives, robots, matter replicators, or whatever the setting contains.

This is presumably done either because the writer included the most advanced tech he/she could think of in the first installment and thus has no where else to go, or because significantly changing the tech level would mean changing the way the stories would have to work.

Compare with medieval stasis, where the technology stagnates at a lower level or the low level technology is the reason for the stagnation, and modern stasis.
