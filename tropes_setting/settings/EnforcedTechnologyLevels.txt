This is a speculative fiction trope where, for whatever reason, there are certain rules about what kinds of technology can exist. The ways these rules are enforced vary, from the the relatively mundane (some kind of "technology" police) to fantastic (magic, nanotech, or the laws of nature themselves). What's consistent, though, is that these rules will effectively (or even explicitly) lock a society into a certain technological level.

When magic is involved, this might delve into a magic versus technology war (since areas where magic works may not allow technology to work, and vice versa). For a rather specific example (when it's played literally), see medieval stasis. Compare with schizo tech, where differing levels of technology are all mashed up together. Compare decade dissonance, when this sort of things arises naturally, not due to any enforcement. See also you are not ready, which might be the justification for keeping certain areas at a lower tech level.
