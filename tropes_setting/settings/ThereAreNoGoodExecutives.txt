In this setting, all businessmen are some variation of the corrupt corporate executive. To them, swindling customers, abusing employees or even resorting to violence to eliminate threats to their wealth and power simply comes with the job. Either that or it's a nice fringe benefit. Don't expect to find any honest corporate executives. Even if you think you've found one, they'll turn out to be a villain with good publicity.

This trope can be truth in television, but just as likely not. While some businessmen are evil, deceptive, and depraved, it is extreme hyperbole to consider all of them to be so. Indeed, it is quite reasonable to argue that evil conduct is (in the long run) bad for a business; would you want to do business with a baby-eating puppy-kicking psychopath?

At times, this trope overlaps with artistic license - economics.

You may note that millionaire entrepreneurs do not always fall into this trope. These people are often depicted as independently wealthy self made men who have wits and spirit enough to carve out their empires, and if not, they at least are in charge and take responsibility of them, tied to them in a way a king may be to his realm. Corporate executives, on the other hand, climb in an already established hierarchy, the leadership (thus also responsibility for any wrongdoing) of which is decentralised into some shadowy group, like "the board of directors"; going back to our feudal analogy, they would have more in common with court intriguers.

This trope is incredibly common in cyberpunk works. Ironic, considering that Cyberpunk mega corp. entities were based on the bureaucratic monoliths of 1950's America and the Zaibatsu Corporations (i.e. "preferred merchants") of Japan, which were anything but free market entities.

Joseph Schumpeter, a classically liberal (and hence proÂ–free-market) economist, believed that the corporate, bureaucratic economies (which were run on a mixture of Keynesianism and Corporate Statism, rather than laissez-faire free markets) of 1950s America were going to destroy free markets by strangling the Entrepreneur and the Innovator under a blanket of institutionalized stagnation.

 More generally, this trope tends to be directed at big multinational corporations as opposed to smaller mom-and-pop stores or collectively owned co-ops. A recurring theme both in fiction and reality is that of large businesses and big-box stores like Wal-Mart wiping out smaller, more local economies and businesses. For all that the owner of the local restaurant or coffee shop is himself an entrepreneur, he tends to be depicted more positively than the owner of a large multinational firm. Of course, most mom-and-pop coffee shops don't require their employees to do the Wal-Mart cheer every morning...
