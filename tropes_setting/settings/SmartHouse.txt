The Smart House is a fully automated house controlled by a sophisticated computer AI. Basically, you talk to the house, and tell it what you want, and it does it for you. Turn on the lights, cook breakfast, even draw your bath. Some smart houses will even monitor your vital signs.

The AI often has a human name, and they frequently have feminine personalities and voices.

Because a.i. is a crapshoot, Smart House ais have a tendency to go horribly awry. They usually don't become actually evil, but they can become jealously overprotective of their owners. In some instances, they are shown falling in love with their owners or becoming envious of their owners relationships with other humans. May be subject to zeerust depending on the age depicted.

See cool house and genius loci, of which this is a subtrope. May overlap with sapient house, depending on levels of automation and intelligence.
