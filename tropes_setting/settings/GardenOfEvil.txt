A Garden of Evil is a distinctly unpleasant place to be, where all forms of life within are poisonous, corrupted, and extremely deadly. Often populated by sinister research (scientific or magical) experiments run amok, the garden can also serve as a protective barrier for a villain's lair. This is the plant life of mordor.

There is probably a hedgemaze â€” quite possibly mobile.

May be under a curse.

Scale can vary greatly. A common type of death world consists entirely of this. In instances where the garden grows, expect the end of the world as we know it. See the lost woods, the hedge of thorns, man-eating plant, when trees attack, alien kudzu, meat moss, and lost in the maize. No relation to the garden of sinners.
