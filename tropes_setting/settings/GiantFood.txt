A staple of kids' media. A fantasy of either becoming small or being in a land of giants, and coming across a table full of food. Appeals to the greedy kid in us all.

The archetype would be "jack and the beanstalk".

Not to be confused with the US mid-Atlantic regional supermarket chain or the other US mid-Atlantic regional supermarket chain. Compare level ate which is likely constructed out of Giant Food.
