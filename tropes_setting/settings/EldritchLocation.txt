In fiction-land, some places just don't agree with the laws of physics, geography, and the way we understand the world.

Eldritch Locations take many forms: lost worlds, wonderlands ("Wonder" is not always a good thing) Strange Planets, Incomprehensible Voids, the insides of eldritch abominations, alternate universes, ordinary-looking buildings... basically, wherever the author decides could use some weirdness.

These are usually depicted as bad places, but not always. The ones that aren't are usually sources of surreal humor.

If this place is a planet or country, then it will often feature an alien sky, as well as mix-and-match critters or star fish aliens by the herd. Expect all geometries to be alien or sinister. However, like any self-respecting cosmic horror story, you can bet this is only a small part of its fundamental strangeness.

If it even exists in the same dimension as our insignificant little blue planet, chances are it's either outside the world entirely (and often accessible only by a cool gate), or located in a strange, unknown corner of the earth. it may have never been seen by man before. If so, expect at least one character, upon seeing it, to widen his eyes and gasp: "what is this place?!"The big bad may set up A very definitely final dungeon or an amazing technicolor battlefield here.

Compare world of chaos, lost world, dark world, dream land.

Some common settings, such as the sugar bowl, can fall right into this trope if you think about them enough.
