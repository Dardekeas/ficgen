Every so often in science fiction that takes place in the Near Future or at least the not so distant future, there will be rebels, and all rebels need a suitable hideout. Maybe there's an abandoned warehouse or an empty cave, but that's only for rebels who don't have it in them to be a real rebel army.

If you're about to tell the evil government or the alien invaders who's about to be in charge here, you need a base that really brings the message around.

You need Ye Olde Nuclear Silo. Originally created in the cold war or in preparation for world war iii, nuclear silos provide everything a real rebel army needs: It's a miniature military base removed from larger settlements and hidden from most observers in the sky, has all the pipes and cables for the industrial feeling, and those gigantic, slow-moving doors! It usually comes conveniently with fully functioning computer equipment since it was already designed to survive armageddon, and it also provides that cozy damp cave atmosphere. If you're really lucky, it may even come with a functional missile and warhead.

Note that this trope extends to cover pretty much any other type of small secret underground military installations. If the lair is more expansive, it's an elaborate underground base. If it's taken over by civilians, it may become an underground city.
