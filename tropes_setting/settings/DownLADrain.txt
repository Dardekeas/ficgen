Fun fact: That's not just a storm drain system, that's what's left of the Los Angeles River (which would be dry in the summer if not for lawn runoff, and which has been put into concrete channels for almost its entire length). The river is pretty much gone now (except during sudden downpours), mostly due to urban development and diverting its tributaries. Note that this is not the same as the L.A. sewer system.

Basically, these large concrete drains (as mentioned above, actually a riverbed that was lined in concrete to control erosion) get a lot of mileage for chase scenes in movies because they look interesting and because they're conveniently nearby for any shows or movies produced in the los angeles area (that is to say, anything produced in Hollywood, which is quite a bit of stuff). The fact that there's not much traffic that you'd need to block or divert for filming probably also makes it convenient.

It's kind of like the urban car chase equivalent of kirk's rock. May overlap with absurdly spacious sewer. Compare artificial riverbank. Not to be confused with down the drain.
