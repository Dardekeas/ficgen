Peaceful, idyllic societies have a tendency to be vegetarian (if not vegan) in fiction. As often as not, these societies are portrayed as being morally, perhaps even spiritually/magically superior to our own, implying that humanity's meat-eating habit is somehow holding us back from living in a world of crystal spires and togas. Sometimes it can be downright anvilicious.

Some cases aren't so focused on the evils of eating animals so much as how circumstances might force people to adopt a vegetarian diet. See future food is artificial for examples of this.

Races that refrain from meat-eating simply because their digestive physiology is herbivorous aren't necessarily examples of this trope — if they have to eat plants, they're not really demonstrating moral superiority by doing so — but such species may subvert this trope's expectations if they're violently-aggressive in spite of their diet.

Probably stems from the issues raised by carnivore confusion and let's meet the meat. See also mary suetopia and perfect pacifist people. See herbivores are friendly for the herbivorous animal equivalent.

 One of the most common tenets of ascetic living (regardless of creed) is forgoing meat and other animal derived foods. Even practitioners who don't espouse some greater than average respect for animals feel that such products are a luxury that they are better off without and some even link abstinence from meat to improved spiritual or mental abilities.
