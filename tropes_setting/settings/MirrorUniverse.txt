Often a subset of bizarro universe, it is an alternate universe where Good and Evil characterisations are reversed, but is otherwise the same as the "real" universe - except where logically derived from this change in morality. As an example, in bizarro world, the earth is a cube. In the mirror universe, the earth is a sphere, but the mirror self of the brigadier has a cool eyepatch.

Occasionally, some other characteristic is reversed. The hero in the mirror universe functions as the evil twin. The five-man band becomes the psycho rangers or five-bad band. Expect the loyal soldier to become a blithering coward, the backstabbing bastard to become a peaceful negotiator, and the bridge bunny who normally gets no lines to become a trash-talking, lingerie-wearing, gun-toting, bisexually hyperactive ball of unleashed id.

These mirror worlds tend to get popular with the fanbase, who'll eagerly come up with alternate versions of any character not yet shown, and as a result it'll often get returned to and expanded upon to please them. The status quo in the mirror universe is more likely to change than the original one, probably because the writers are allowed to do it.

From the Star Trek: The Original Series episode "mirror, mirror". In homage to this episode, it's common for an evil mirror equivalent to have a goatee beard.

Contrast with dark world. Not to be confused with mirror world.
