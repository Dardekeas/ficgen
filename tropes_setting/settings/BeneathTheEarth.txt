A very short distance beneath our feet, there dwell fantastic beings, societies and terrors.

Those who live beneath the earth are often exiles from the World Above. They fled either to create a new home for themselves, or to harbor their grudge for revenge (depending on how well they did). Alternately, they may have fled to escape the end of their world as they knew it. If they had better technology or more resources, they might have built an elaborate underground base or even an underground city; but if they don't they have to make do with simple caves and tunnels.

The Urban area version of this trope is a remarkably livable sewer system. Sewers are surprisingly clean and warm, relatively speaking, with good lighting and electricity access. Maintenance crews never stumble across the living quarters, nor do power companies realize the drain. (Sewer Dwellers don't pay electricity bills.) New York has an especially crowded sewer system.

Go a few kilometers deeper, and the Earth's crust is filled with spacious caverns. The really lucky beneath the earth dwellers will have a lost world thing going, with tropical flora and fauna in abundance (although occasionally with monsters like dinosaurs).

Not so lucky ones get gloom, fungus and lava. (They're the ones who usually want revenge.) Often based on the "Morlocks" in h. g. wells' book The Time Machine. Particularly well-to-do ones will build an underground city instead.

Often found side-by-side in with the underground level and absurdly spacious sewer. In mythology, folklore, and fantasy, this is typically where you'll find the underworld. (Or that other place.) The king in the mountain can also be found here, resting until his hour of need comes again. See also mouse world, which is basically this but on a smaller scale, and dug too deep.
