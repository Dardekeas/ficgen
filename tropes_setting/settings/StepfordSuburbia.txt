Ah, suburbia: the sunny lanes, the friendly neighbours, the smiling children, the pastel colour scheme, the rotting skeletons hiding in everyone's closet.

When they are too perfect to be true, the suburbs of the fifties and the present can be downright creepy. Mom baking fresh apple pies every day, the kids getting A's in every subject on their report card, neighbours who grin like their teeth are wired open... there's something unsettling about it.

This is a town with a dark secret, with the added twist that the Dark Secret is hidden in this "idyllic" neighbourhood. The Trope Namer is, of course The Stepford Wives, a thoroughly creepifying book about such a town.

stepford suburbia is the sister-city to the uncanny village, and both are located in the crapsaccharine world. Its residents include angsty teens, the beautiful elite and, of course, the stepford smiler.
