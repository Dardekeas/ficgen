Welcome To The World Of Tomorrow! Literally.

Next Sunday A.D. is almost exactly the same as the present day. Same politics, same technology, same brands, same popular culture... the only difference is that when you glance at the calendar, it shows a date about a year or two after the series was released. Writers often set a series in Next Sunday A.D. to avoid people wondering why they didn't hear about the deranged serial killer or alien invasion on the news.The trope name comes from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 opening theme, though that series is not an example of this trope.

Compare twenty minutes into the future, wherein the difference in time frame is a bit more apparent. (yes, that should be the other way around. No, it won't be fixed.)
