Tombs, burial chambers, sepulchers, mausoleums, charnel houses, ossuaries, catacombs, crypts, sometimes even dungeons.

An important stock setting.

Popular in both horror and action-adventure fiction. eldritch abominations, dracula, zombies, mummies, ghouls, demons, and other stock horror-movie monsters can often be found here. Usually comes in two varieties; the elaborate ancient tomb built by a similarly-ancient civilization (aztecs and egyptians particularly) with plenty of booby traps and ancient curses, and a European-style gothic tomb full of gargoyles, vampires, skeletons, and corpses chained there by petty nobles.

May overlap with indian burial ground, and in particularly elaborate cases, temple of doom. Note that a can of evil or tailor-made prison may be disguised as, or converted from, a tomb.
