Fictional road trips often involve long treks through picturesque landscapes, usually on two-lane country roads, when the characters would get there much faster if they just took the freeway. Often results in an aesop about the importance of enjoying the journey.

Occasionally the road will be a famous one, like Route 66 or the Pacific Coast Highway. Route 66 in particular has been the subject of many stories.

chase scenes can be prone to this too, passing by city landmarks in an order that defies logic to a local of the particular city.
