After World War II the veterans came home, married and bred creating the Baby Boom in the United States. Houses were needed. Lots and lots of houses. Entire neighborhoods were built with houses only slightly different from each other. Minor variation in detail from house to house only accentuated the similarities and made each neighborhood hopelessly dull. The yards are also uniform. One common tactic to make them look different is flipping the blueprint, as if having the garage on the left instead of the right would create visual interest.

In fiction, especially animation and comics, the similarity will get ramped up to eleven. The houses, gardens, cars will be identical. The lives of the residents may be identical or the point may be that their lives are different, even if their houses are the same.

Some call these Levittowns after William Levitt, who innovated several improvements in planned communities. (wikipedia uses this as the official term, but it is not to be confused with actual towns named Levittown.) Others use the term "tract housing" because a whole line of them is built at once. Nowadays the most common term is "development."

Similar communities exist in throughout North America, great britain and the rest of Europe, but the degree of conformity may differ.

Contrast with stepford suburbia, a subdivision or town where everyone appears to be happy but is hiding a dark secret.
