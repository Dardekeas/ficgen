Essentially, it's a sentient setting with a possessive yandere complex for anyone unfortunate enough to visit. Or fortunate enough, if you fancy staying to enjoy the party. Sometimes, however, the party is just a build-up to you being the main courseÂ…

Compare lotus-eater machine (the trope namer for which is a mild example of this trope)
