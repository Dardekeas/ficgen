So, we have a world. The world has magic in it. However, this world isn't a normal fantasy setting and is instead more or less the real world. Well, then what happens to magic or magical creatures? It turns out that they disappear, for better or worse.

It seems that magic and science simply don't go well together, so that as one grows stronger, the other fades. Thus, the further humanity progresses in either science or civilization, the weaker magic becomes. In some cases, magic may even die outright.

See magic versus science for reasons for conflict between the two systems. May occur because magic draws its power from "belief", and belief is antithetical to knowledge.

This may be a factor in the magic goes away. Compare death of the old gods. Compare and contrast the magic versus technology war, which involves more direct conflict. If magic appears to disappear, but is merely explained by advances in science, then it's doing in the wizard  or magic from technology.

Contrast doing in the scientist, which can be seen as this trope in reverse; science fades because of magical underpinnings.
