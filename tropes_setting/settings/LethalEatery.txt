Lots of comedies feature restaurants and other food service venues with breathtakingly bad public health risks. Food is sold months even years after its expiration date. It's often prepared by an uncouth cook who manages to get a great deal of hair and bodily fluid into whatever he's cooking. This is almost always played for laughs.

A Lethal Eatery may employ a lethal chef or two, but in some cases the food tastes alright despite being coated in bacteria.
