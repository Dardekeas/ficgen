A Mental World is any world that exists inside a person's mind (or heart, soul, whatever, but not their physical body). Similar to dream land and cyberspace, a Mental World does not follow the regular laws of physics, and may ignore or respond badly to characters trying to use logic or force. This world is usually entered by some type of telepathy, either magical or technological; if the character whose mind contains the Mental World is sleeping or unconscious their individual dreamworld may be physically attached to a larger dream land or collective unconscious, which makes it enterable by other dreaming or meditating people.

Symbolism is king here, sympathetic magic may be in operation, and puns, metaphors, and metamorphoses may be common. Because this world is based on an individual's (possibly incorrect) beliefs, it may contain multiple evil twin versions of both the owner's personality and that of anyone else they know, especially the people exploring the world. Sometimes this works in the other direction, and changes made inside the Mental World may change the beliefs of the individual who is the source of the world in question.

In other cases, this Mental World is more like a magical pocket dimension where the controlling mage can wage battles, imprison others, hide themselves from enemies, or even take a friend for a vacation. In this case the world does not necessarily exist strictly inside the character's mind, but still behaves as if it does because it is woven out of that person's magic and actively connected to that person's mind (and still generally representative of their "self").

Not to be confused with womb level.
