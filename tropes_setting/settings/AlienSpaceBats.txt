An alternate history trope dealing with the divergence of a timeline. If the point of divergence is an extraordinary or supernatural phenomenon, Alien Space Bats are responsible.

The phrase was originally coined by the late Alison Brooks as a sarcastic comment on ridiculous Alternate History timelines with no realistic chance of happening without some sort of deus ex machina as implausibly contrived as bringing in a bunch of sufficiently advanced alien bats. It was only later that it came to mean "explicitly magical or science-fiction what-ifs."

Alien Space Bats is in a sense the opposite of deus ex machina: where deus ex machina is the introduction of an implausible element outside of the context of the narrative to resolve a plot conflict, Alien Space Bats are an implausible element outside the context of the narrative introduced in order to set up the main plot conflict or setting of the story.

The trope may also apply when the point of divergence isn't actually supernatural, but so wildly implausible that it might as well be that a wizard did it.

Note that tropes are not bad: this can and does lead to some excellent yarns, especially if schizo tech is involved. Even if the event setting up the plot is fantastic or wildly improbable, that doesn't mean that the character's reactions to it have to be equally unrealistic.

A frequent mechanism by which Alien Space Bats intervene in human history is mass teleportation. When on a small scale, their intervention may leave people trapped in the past. See also never was this universe.

Not to be confused with goddamn bats, or the batman from  who actually is an alien. Only vaguely related to the movie lifeforce, which is not AH, but has literal alien bats.
