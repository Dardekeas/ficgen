Wherever there's an indian reservation in Movieland, there has to be a casino.

This is partly truth in television. In the United States, Native American tribal reservations are outside state jurisdiction, and thus exempt from any state gambling bans or regulation. Since reservations are typically among the poorest and least developed parts of the nation, the upside is that giving them a monopoly on gaming is a way to attract tourists and jump-start reservation economies. The downside is that impoverished residents can be attracted to addictive gambling, and there is no guarantee that the casinos will enrich anyone but the owners.
