You know the place. It was a vacant lot when you went by this time yesterday. It'll probably be a vacant lot again this time tomorrow but right now, there's a shop there that looks like it came out of charles dickens — or maybe h.p. lovecraft. If you go inside, you'll find a quirky old shopkeeper who has any number of potentially magical — and potentially inconvenient — artifacts available for sale. Cheap. Today only. Just for you.

Just don't expect a liberal returns policy.

Originally a literary device from the surge of weird fantasy writing in the 1920s and earlier — H.G. Wells used it in The Crystal Egg (1897) and The Magic Shop (1903) — The Little Shop That Wasn't There Yesterday still turns up occasionally. Nowadays, it's often a website. Frequently an element of the modern creepy pasta, when the store is virtual it overlaps with murder.com.
