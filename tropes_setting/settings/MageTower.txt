Wizards often seem to live in towers. Not all of them, certainly, but enough for the tendency to be noticed.

Sometimes these towers are no larger than is needed for a single individual, while other times, they house an entire community of magicians, and may possibly serve as a wizarding school or the headquarters of a magocracy. Sometimes they're free-standing, while at other times, they're tacked on to some larger building, such as a castle (especially if the wizard is a court mage).

This trope probably stems from the metaphorical "ivory tower", which refers to academics who remove themselves from the rest of society to study. A high tower conveys a sense of isolation from "normal" people, which those academics (or in this case, magicians) use to study in peace, much the same way that religious gurus are often depicted praying on mountaintops. In another sense, high towers are ancient symbols of arrogance and hubris. Or simply extreme isolation.

A subtrope of the tower, obviously. A tower owned by a wizard of evil-ish disposition will likely be an evil tower of ominousness.
