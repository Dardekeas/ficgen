In settings taking place on a planet, the planet is generally in one piece.

In a shattered world, this is not the case.

Maybe magic or science has gone horribly wrong, causing an earth-shattering kaboom, or maybe something else bad has happened, but a former planet is now broken into small pieces, floating through space. If this trope is used as a setting, these pieces will usually have settlements of some sort on them (not to be confused with asteroid thickets, which are normally just obstacles).

Unlike a floating continent, a shattered world isn't hovering over a planet.

If the pieces are somehow hovering in an atmosphere with gravity, that's world in the sky.
