Metals, especially iron and copper, are a critical part of a typical human civilization. A common setting in science fiction and fantasy is a world that is lacking in these materials. This lack can be used to drive the plot, or simply to provide an unusual background for the story.

This can be a reason for a medieval stasis or the driving force behind the development of magitek or organic technology. bamboo technology is a possible (but uncommon) outcome.

There is an element of zeerust to this trope, as real world advances in materials science is increasingly demonstrating the ways in which elements like carbon and silicon can be used to produce both structural materials and electronic components with little or no iron, copper or other traditionally used metals. In particular, many works in the science fiction genre start with the assumption that virtually all future technology would be based on metals like iron, and that the lack of it would result in a technological collapse since nobody could conceive of using anything else.
