Because there are so many types of dystopian settings, a supertrope index was needed.

This is intended to cover both those settings where virtually any honest, decent, rational people wouldn't want to live if they had a better choice, and those that while some people REALLY wouldn't want to live here, others would find them to be a paradise or at least acceptable.

For settings that are dystopias for those who hate regional or national stereotypes, please see the hollywood atlas. When the oppressed fight back, see civil unrest tropes.
