The big box store variation of the crappy fast food mcjob or the low level office job.

The store is filled to brim with merchandise reaching up to the fluorescent light ceiling, annoying consumer crazed customers and of course, dozens of overworked, underpaid disgruntled employees. This is where dreams of a successful career go to die, right into the discount bin.

The new job episode will often focus on one character working in such an environment (if he doesn't become a burger fool) and then subsequently finding out being a grocery store or local wal-mart employee is not as easy as it looks. Alternatively, the fiction will sometimes focus on those poor souls that have already been working there for years (Such as in Clerks or Employee of the Month) and will give the viewer an inside look at life behind the counter.

Either way, as this is truth in television, having this job is certainly no fun. Between the obnoxious customers, the horrible music and the tyrannical management, quitting or getting fired is sometimes the only way out.

If the store is making peoples lives miserable outside the store as well, it's a predatory business.
