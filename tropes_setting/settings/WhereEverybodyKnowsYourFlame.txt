In real life, the average gay bar is simply a pub where most of the regular patrons are of gay male, lesbian, bisexual, and/or transgender persuasion. That's really all there is to it. Mostly they are just places where GLBT people socialize, dance, have a few beers, play pool, etc. Sometimes people chat up/pick up a new partner in these places just as straight people do in straight bars and pubs.

In the media, this is simply not the case, especially when the gay community is treated as the subculture of the week. Any bar or club catering to GLBT people will be portrayed as far wilder than its straight counterpart. People will order drinks dressed in fetish gear such as studded leather, gimp masks or tight rubber. drag queens will strut about like they run the place (and one probably does), and loud techno/synth music will blast from the speakers. The fact that there are different clubs for different gay subcultures in real life isn't always realized.

Lesbian bars will be filled entirely with broad-shouldered, cigar chomping, work-booted, diesel dykes; or young, nubile lipstick lesbians. And the two shall never meet, even if it's the only lesbian bar in town.As is the rule of cool, gay audiences will note that such bars will be larger, sleeker, flashier, wilder, and generally far more interesting than anything they have in their own neck of the woods, unless they live in a big city. In fiction, the gay bars in Youngstown, Ohio are just as huge and lively as anything in West Hollywood.

Depending on the reaction of the characters, this is a sub-trope of either coolest club ever or bad-guy bar. Contrast bikini bar, which if anything is tamer than the real life places it portrays. Often used to set up jokes at the patrons' expense. Often, this sort of bar will be used for a gay bar reveal; in this case, it's going to have to be for a parody of the trope because it is near impossible to mistake this sort of club for what it is.
