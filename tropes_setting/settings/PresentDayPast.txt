You're making a movie set in a recent time, say 2004. Well, that's not long ago enough to make for a period film, is it? This apparently means it's okay for Alice to listen to justin bieber on an iPod Touch and for Bob (or more likely, someone in the background) to drive around in a 2009 Honda Accord. After all, it's practically the present day, right?

This trope is when, while making a story set during the recent past, the contemporary culture of the production seeps in, creating an anachronism stew. It varies whether this becomes more obvious or less in the ensuing years. Most period works are anachronism stews anyway, but it's pretty noticeable when a fad shows up in the wrong time period. Witness the seventies fashions and hairstyles on Happy Days.

The bellisario's maxim can sometimes be applied with regard to location shoots and incorrect background details. Sometimes there just isn't time or money to get everything right. It's also impossible to control everything when working in a public setting; you're going to have to put up with pedestrians and other people who aren't part of the film's crew (and therefore aren't in costume) appearing in the background. Still, it's fun to spot them...

Of course, much of this assumes that casual viewers will actually notice the discrepancies. There will always be someone who does, but assuming that every person watching will have an encyclopedic knowledge of every past era is a bit presumptuous. In fact, this trope probably exists precisely because authors usually make the opposite assumption.

A sub-trope of anachronism stew. Often overlaps with hollywood costuming. next sunday a.d. sometimes involves inversions of this, depending on how things turn out in the future (for example, it seems pretty safe to have people using youtube two years from now, but who knows?).

Compare comic book time and retro universe.

Contrast popular history, two decades behind and unintentional period piece.
