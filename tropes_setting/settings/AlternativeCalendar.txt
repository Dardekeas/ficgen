In speculative fiction, it's common to use a different calendar than the real world. This makes it clear to the reader that the story takes place either in another world, or in a version of our world so far in the future that time isn't even counted the same way. This also elegantly sidesteps the problems of exty years from now.

In fantasy, a popular version of this is to measure time in "moons" instead of months. In some cases, the author will actually have twelve different names of the form "______ Moon" to replace the twelve months of the Gregorian calendar. Nonetheless, there are actually somewhat more than twelve lunar months in an Earth year. Real lunisolar calendars solve that problem by adding a leap month to certain years; some purely lunar calendars (like the Islamic one) ignore the solar year altogether and just declare twelve lunar months to be a year.

When an alternative calendar is used to measure the progress of "days", it's common for characters to use microts as smaller, more manageable units of time. In Sci-fi settings, these calendars are frequently used across multiple worlds, becoming standard time units.

If alternative calendar is used in science fiction with Earthian years, it may mean that the work takes place after the end or something else that hit so hard the calendar felt it or that everybody have outgrown such silly superstitions and chose something significant for their reference point.

A common Year One, Day One in science fiction is October 4, 1957 - the date Sputnik was launched, thereby beginning the Space Age.
