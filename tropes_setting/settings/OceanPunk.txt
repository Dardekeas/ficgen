Life in a mostly watery world (or a mostly watery part of the world where the rest isn't of much matter) with distant islands connected by trade routes, ships sailing back and forth, and of course, many pirates and buccaneers, whether they're wielding cutlasses on sailing ships or the aquatic equivalent of humongous mecha. May contain organic technology, and have a large focus on what happens under the waves as well as over. Fantastic elements in keeping with old sailors' superstitions (mermaids, abandoned derelicts that often aren't so abandoned after all, giant sea monsters) can fit, too.
