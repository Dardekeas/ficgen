If you're a writer of a TV drama series with recurring characters, you have a problem: You need a new story every week, and they cannot all be just about your regular cast. So most TV series formats, particularly for drama, involve some way of bringing a new set of guest stars into your leads' lives for every episode. There are just two ways to do this: Either your leads work as cops, lawyers, doctors, or some other profession that naturally brings lots of other people to them for short periods of time; or else your leads do something that has them travelling around a lot, meeting new people and situations wherever they go.

Maybe they're drifters walking the earth. Maybe they are being chased by the law. Maybe they are just trying to get home. Whatever the reason, our main characters go to a new place each week that results in an adventure that they have to solve in forty-two minutes â€” sixty minutes minus the commercials. Often the heroes will be mistaken for spies when they get there. Count on a local or two to help.

The location version of monster of the week. Compare to city of adventure and wacky wayside tribe. In science fiction shows, instead of going from town to town, the protagonists tend to go from world to world (thus travelling to "adventure planets"). Combined with alternate universe to make "Adventure Universes" in Sliders. Combine it with time travel and you get Quantum Leap. Combine with both space travel and time travel (plus the occasional alternate universe), and you get Doctor Who.

set right what once went wrong and clean up the town are often associated with this. Wandering heroes like the drifter and the knight errant are built to save Adventure Towns.

A subset would be the town with a dark secret. Best examples are from movies like Bad Day At Black Rock, High Plains Drifter, or Hang 'Em High. The town is complicit in some evil criminal past and the arrival of the stranger disrupts their efforts to keep the lid on.
