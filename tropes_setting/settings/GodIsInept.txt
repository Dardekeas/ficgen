And in The beginning, god, the council of angels, or what have you Created The Universe...

But in retrospect, they botched a few things up in the original design, a few things just don't do what they were probably intended to do, and there's all these little bits of design that make people go "What the... I could have designed this better!" These aren't moral things; there is no refuge in claiming that god is evil. It's just shoddy worksmanship.

May result in a crapsack world, crapsaccharine world, götterdämmerung, be the cause of the problem that the quest is about, or merely be a peculiar background detail. Not the same as the gods must be lazy; the design errors may be causing the gods extra work.

God may later claim that it was just a gambit roulette justified by their omniscient morality license, and that obfuscating stupidity is all part of their master plan... but unless the ending explodes in a hail of chekhov's gunfire, especially if accompanied by a prearranged divine ass pull of divine might, that explanation just never seems very convincing, somehow. As a rule of thumb, if a person can, in retrospect, work out how the plan was set up in advance, and some previously arranged coincidences unravel into karmically appropriate boons before the end, it was probably a divine plan. Otherwise, it's probably just bumbling.

Essentially, applying the hanlon's razor approach to god is evil.

Compare god is flawed. May lead to questioning via religious russian roulette.
