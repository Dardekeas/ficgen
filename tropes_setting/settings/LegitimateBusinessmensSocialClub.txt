Ah, the mafia. Known for their subtlety and planning, they can orchestrate murder, drug dealing, prostitution, and the sale of illicit tomato sauce without anyone finding out. But their fronts lack the same subtlety, as can clearly be seen on the massive sign above their hideout that says "" Expect a great deal of doublespeak.

Sometimes non-Mafia criminal organizations also employ this trope.

The trope namer is Fat Tony and the Springfield Mafia's lair on The Simpsons, itself a reference to al capone's famous claim of being just "a legitimate businessman". Compare most definitely not a villain. Contrast covert group with mundane front. Not to be confused with the smoky gentlemen's club, although it may look like one, especially if it's the personal hangout of the don himself.
