If you walk far enough, you'll fall off the edge of the world. For this world is not round, but flat. What lies beyond the edge? No one knows.

In ancient history, many cultures believed the Earth was flat. Certainly the curvature is so slight that it wasn't until the Greeks that the spherical Earth theory took hold (contrary to popular belief, columbus didn't have to try and convince people that the earth was round).

Flat worlds typically only appear in fantasy. They will usually be a circular disc, although other shapes have appeared. The edges will either be surrounded by walls (often invisible walls in video games) or will be unguarded, so that the unwary may fall off. Occasionally, there are no edges - the world goes on in all directions for infinity.

Sadly, some people believe that this is truth in television.

Not be confused with Flatland, or with an animation called Flatworld.
