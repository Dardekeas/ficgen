You live in a place that can only appear in the most beautiful dreams. The world is perfect, all is well, everyone is happy...

... or so you think. Your cozy little world is not as perfect as it seems. It never was. You just havent noticed yet.

A False Utopia is a place, town, or even a world that seems or at least is supposed to have no faults, while in reality it just hides them very carefully from its inhabitants. Many False Utopias are dystopias in disguise (addressing the 0% approval rating aspect of dystopia is hard), but not all; it's enough to try or pretend to be perfect, but always fall short, simply because perfection isnt part of real life.

A False Utopia can manifest itself in these ways:

 The world is  It looks perfect  The whole utopia is too good to be true. So good it is not true: its only a Look out!!! Many False Utopias are meant to stay secret, so expect heavy spoilers on this trope!

A False Utopia is often a crapsaccharine world. Contrast crapsack world, where the world is Hell but everybody usually knows. If it's a suburb town, it's stepford suburbia.

Compare/Contrast crapsack only by comparison when someone comes to believe they live in a crapsack world by comparing another. Note that in a false utopia, this can go both directions simultaneously.

And no real life examples, please!
