A mercurial base is a large installation on a planet extremely close to a star—so close that direct sunlight would be lethal. As a result, the base is continually moving, to stay in either perpetual twilight or perpetual night.

More plausible versions (relatively speaking—this isn't a particularly plausible idea) often put the mercurial base on train tracks, and use the thermal expansion and contraction of the tracks to move the base; this only works at sunrise or sunset, which can result in added drama. Less plausible versions might move it in just about any way the author thinks is cool, and are probably more likely to try to stay near midnight, or just after sunset, to give themselves a larger safety margin.

Because of the rule of drama, a mercurial base inevitably comes along with one of two events. Either:

 some major character will get stranded on the surface, and needs to get back to the base before the sun rises, or

 the base itself will break down.

At least as applied to Mercury itself, the mercurial base is of necessity a relatively new idea. Astronomers used to think Mercury was tidally locked to the sun, with the day side constantly searing hot and the night side constantly near absolute zero. But in 1965 it was discovered that the planet is only sort-of "locked," in a 3:2 orbital resonance that gives it three days every two years. Thus came the idea that a base would have to move, slowly, in order to stay out of the sun.

This is a subtrope of base on wheels.
