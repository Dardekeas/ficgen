In traditional fantasy, the available technology (as opposed to magic that just works like technology) is generally depicted as being relatively primitive, roughly equivalent to real life sometime prior to the development of modern firearms. In science fiction, just about anything, from the paranormal to the supernatural to sufficiently advanced aliens with technology that acts like magic is allowed, except magic. In the rare fiction where magic and advanced technology exist in the same universe, they rarely get along. In some cases, they merely interfere with each other for unexplained reasons. Sometimes it actually comes to blows, and that's where this trope comes in.

To be this trope, a series needs to have as one of the primary conflicts, an actual shooting war between a faction upholding magic and a faction upholding advanced technology and science. Typically one side is using magic spells, cavalry on dragons, etc., and another that prefers technological weapons like guns, tanks, humongous mecha, etc. Note that "Advanced Technology and Science" is a relative term. It may be as little as Industrial Revolution-era (compared to the standard medieval european fantasy), or even higher than modern times. A good rule of thumb is at least one "age" of technological development over that of the Magic-using civilization.

Often tied to a masquerade. The war could be the result of the unmasqued world; the masquerade can serve to protect an endangered species or avert a genocide dilemma. Expect to see a corrupt corporate executive, evil sorcerer, mad scientist or wicked witch. Compare: science is bad, magic is evil
