A prison doesn't need to have four walls, a ceiling, and a floor. Why would you need those if the prisoner doesn't want to or know how to leave? After all, if you think you are free, no escape is possible. This is the Epiphanic Prison.

As the name implies, the only way to escape an Epiphanic Prison is to have an epiphany. The nature of the enlightenment varies. Sometimes it's self enlightenment, and understanding and mastering one's own fears lets one escape the ontological mystery. Sometimes it's understanding of one's surrounding, of why one is trapped, and thus what must be done to escape.

This often overlaps with lotus-eater machine when the prison is made to feel like paradise so you won't want to leave, psychological torment zone and tailor-made prison. Also see: armor-piercing question and orphean rescue.

For a more literal construct, see also city in a bottle.
