Tornadoes always seem to hit trailer parks. In real life, they're no more vulnerable to tornadoes than major cities, as the odds of a twister hitting any one particular area are relatively low. However, mobile homes are lightweight for buildings and not anchored to the ground, making them more vulnerable to a tornado's fury.

Thus, tornadoes that kill several people and make the news tend to hit trailer parks in the outer ring of exurbs. Twisters that wander harmlessly over empty fields or merely suck a farmhouse up into the sky are too common to be big news anywhere outside the immediate area. Also, in a major case of if it bleeds, it leads, news crews want scenes of utter devastation to report on, which the light, easy to pick-up-and-throw trailers provide, as opposed to normal houses which are anchored to the ground and can usually survive a much closer pass and thus do not provide a good image for TV.

However mundane the above explanation, the fact that newsworthy tornadoes often seem to hit trailer parks have spawned the running gag that "trailer parks have buried tornado magnets under them". Thus, movies and other media that feature tornadoes or trailer parks will usually have both, not just one.
