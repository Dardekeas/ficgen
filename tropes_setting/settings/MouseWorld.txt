Similar in many ways to beneath the earth, mouse world exists in secret on the fringes of human society; the difference is scale. This is an entire class of stories built around tiny protagonists operating just out of sight in the human world. These come in a few flavors, but all share some important common elements. In any case, the lives of the little folk draw eerie parallels to the lives of the big-folk.

In an urban setting, the characters most often act like rats, even when they aren't actual talking animals in the 3- to 6-inch range. They live in mouse holes using adapted or cobbled-together materials made from human trash with the odd toys and models thrown in usually making it scavenged punk.

If they deal with human opponents directly, expect clever trickery, stealth and the odd colossus climb. They may become dinky drivers to operate human vehicles. If humans aren't aware of them in the slightest (as in most cases), it's usually because they either have a strong weirdness censor, the tiny species is keeping a complex and clever masquerade, or they simply regard talking and/or clothed funny animals or tiny humanoids as an unusually uninteresting sight. In some cases one lucky human (usually a child) speaks fluent animal and is the only human character in the story aware of the tiny species. In combination with an incredible shrinking man, you can have a trapped in another world plot. Other slightly larger animals such as cats and dogs may also play a role in this world, but expect animal jingoism to come into play, along with examples of cats are mean.

May have begun with the Lilliputians, and later Gulliver's time with the Brobdignagian giants, in Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. The best-known recent version is probably The Borrowers books.

Not to be confused with the disney theme parks. If you're looking for little people who don't necessarily live in one of these worlds, head over to lilliputians.
