A chamber of horrors exists where unspeakable things are done to people, which typically leads to their doom. It might seem like an inescapable madhouse or some unearthly realm of torment, but the truth is...it's just someone's cellar. Used in suspense and horror works, especially works that revolve around serial killers who enjoy torturing their intended victims.

Over-the-top decorations in blood and bones somehow do not result in insect infestation or a telltale stench alerting anyone to the evil doings of the house's owner. This may be due to visual media being bereft of a sense of smell, so it never occurs to them.

A subtrope of creepy basement. Also related to locked in the dungeon, for a more medieval setting, and is often a sealed room in the middle of nowhere. Often the first nasty room found when exploring the evil lair. See also cannibal larder where the killer piles up their corpses. Closely related is the maximum fun chamber, which is implied to make the rest of the torture cellar look like a day spa.
