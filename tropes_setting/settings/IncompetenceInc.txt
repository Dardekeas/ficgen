Many people have jobs, because they like having money to pay bills and such. Some companies offering those jobs are fun, others aren't.

And then there are some companies where unless you have an economics degree from an Ivy League university, you have absolutely no idea how the company stays in business, thanks to the staggering, mind-numbing degree of incompetence in the company. And in some really extreme cases, even with such a degree you're baffled.

In the real world, there are sometimes mitigating circumstances that would allow an otherwise apparently incompetent business to stay active, ranging from serving as tax write-offs for larger companies, to holding monopolies on a specific resource, and beyond, but most stories don't get anywhere near that detailed in their observations of real life issues like those, for the companies they depict.

May be controlled or managed by pointy haired bosses, be staffed mostly with bogglingly stupid employees, have installations with tons of safety violations, saddled with ludicrous rules and regulations that make no sense outside of some bureaucratic hell, or some combination of the above.
