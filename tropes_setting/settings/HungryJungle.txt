When not a run of jungle japes, the jungle is a harsh and hostile place, frequently deadly for its denizens, but even more ferocious to outsiders no matter what gear they bring with them. This jungle is treated as a semi-sentient entity; a soup of consciousness composed of the ferocity of its native life and climate. And it hungers. It devours sane minds with its stifling and claustrophobic atmosphere, infecting all who enter with a slow, creeping madness in an effort to make them its own. This same climate breeds fetid decay and disease, which likewise infests the body. On top of this, the marvels of modern technology count for nothing. The humidity of the jungle devours advanced technology in a trice. Keeping anything working is a constant, day-to-day struggle to keep up with the jungle's ruination, which further wears at the sanity and morale of any who try it.

The only way out is to die or go mad. Here, you can't imagine there's a world beyond the jungle. The jungle boils everything down to its rawest, most savage form.

God help you if you have to fight a war here, which isn't unknown. Compare darkest africa. Also tends to be full of big creepy-crawlies.
