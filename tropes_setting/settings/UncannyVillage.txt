A beautiful, seemingly utopian community which is not what it seems. Often either under control of a morally questionable conspiracy or demented super computer, or protected by a deal with the devil. May even be an entire town of well intentioned extremists.

Not quite the same as town with a dark secret as these are usually not particularly idyllic nor do they have The Village's uncanny quality. May overlap with stepford suburbia. Contrast quirky town. A wrong genre savvy character may take it for a close-knit community â€” or vice versa.
