A school stereotype that permits assumptions about the type of student the school will attract. Knowing the character attends a particular school implies a set of characteristics.

The schools used for this fall into the following categories:



Berserkeley is filled with granola girls, rude skaterpunks, angry socialists/communists/anarchists/your choice of far-left political radical howling about how amerikkka is pure evil and that we deserve to die in a ditch, pissed-off black nationalists and militant minorities who really hate white students, angry radical feminists who see sexism everywhere, irritating, pretentious, elitist hipsters wearing risible fashions and making nonsensical, offensive pieces of art (read: trash) to complain about the mainstream, hollywood atheists, and aging hippies. The faculty will be all of the above  just with pieces of paper saying theyre better educated.

Every third storefront is a coffeehouse with awful writers reading bad poetry and pretentious beatniks explaining how true their incomprehensible art is. The city council is packed with people who pass truly absurd and paternalistic ordinances  after they finish decriminalizing weed.

Real schools used to invoke this one:

 University of California, Berkeley,  Wellesley College  This one is handy if you need   The University of Glasgow in Scotland fits the political part of this but not really the pretentiousness bit. That would be St Andrews or Edinburgh.

 Reed College in Portland, Oregon  they only tell students their grades if specifically asked to, the administration has an extremely lax drug-use policy even for hyper-liberal Portland, and about half of their traditions are weird hippie injokes. The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington  does not assign grades to students at  The University of Colorado at Boulder  Much like UC Berkeley. A liberal college in a liberal enclave in a conservative(-ish, see  Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos from Perú, The National University of Saint Mark.

 Virginia Commonwealth University, Particularly the school of Arts, is known for its highly liberal use of drugs and high amount of  Kent State University, Kent, Ohio  Popular for antiwar-style liberals, thanks to the 1970 National Guard shooting that left four students dead.

 University of WisconsinMadison  likewise a history of 1960s  Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, has a reputation for progressive activism where students were known to adorn the interior hallways with left-wing graffiti. Or, as Aileen LeBlanc of  Although many (most?) religious colleges fit easily into the Jim Jonestown University mold described below, a few dont:

 The University of the Philippines (or UP for short) in metropolitan Manila, Philippines has gained a reputation as a hotbed for activists and radicals spanning  The University of Texas at Austin is noted for this, as Austin is very famously a weird and liberal place. Its somewhat unclear whether the university is weird because its in Austin or the city is weird because UT is in it. Either way it often gets contrasted to Texas A&M.

 Mexico has its Jesuit universities: the Iberoamerican Universities (Mexico City, León, Puebla and Torreón), the Pacific Loyola University in Acapulco, the ITESO in Guadalajara, and the Ayuuk Intercultural Higher Education Institute — the last one's name comes from the lectures and courses being literally taught in the local ayuuk language.



Run by the harshest, most conservative dean bitterman imaginable and his goons, bordering on fascism. The only things in town are a huge corrupt church and a Walmart, and the school itself is filled with jerk jocks, corrupt hicks more interested in lining their pockets, abusing their students, and drilling conservative values into them than teaching, alpha bitches, rich assholes who cant care less about education and bought their way in  and out, fundamentalists who constantly teach lies and intolerance in the classroom and will give the worst punishments to those who even think otherwise, and moral guardians blaming the downfall of America on the lack of Jesus and the presence of boobs on TV. The faculty and students will often be incredibly racist, sexist, and/or homophobic, and anyone who doesnt fit into the herd gets beaten down  literally, in some cases  or worse.

Anyone who has half a brain turns out to be either a stepford smiler, holier than thou, or ax-crazy. The city council, if it exists, will be packed with corrupt corporate executives and oppressive, right-wing pastors who want to eject anyone who dares to be liberal. Being a historic university, its founding charter frequently comes with a long and detailed list of complex bylaws and regulations which just seem tailor-made for the Dean to abuse our plucky heroes.

Schools in this continuum:

 Religious schools that primarily turn out pastors and missionaries (Bob Jones, Regent, Oral Roberts,  Jesuits have a bit of a reputation among Catholics for being a) liberal and b) intelligent leading to them also being c) really good at rationalizing whatever it is they want to do. Their colleges tend to reflect this, being "liberal" by hard-line Catholic standards; students at a Jesuit college can generally get away with stuff that would horrify the administration at a Baptist college.

 Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (Pontifical Catholic University of Peru) is a private university that has this characteristic with   Texas A&M gets a big (not exactly unwarranted) reputation for this, especially compared to its more liberal and diverse neighbor/rival, University of Texas. Until 1960, it was closed to women and minorities (then again, liberal colleges such as Harvard were closed to women as well) and required all students to train as reserve officers in the Army (ROTC, basically). Even after the end of that requirement, A&Ms Corps of Cadets is far larger than the average and A&M remains one of the most conservative schools in the country.

 Mexico has the Pan-American University, where law students are never once taught about divorce procedure, you're required to show up to your exams wearing a three-piece suit, you must always behave like a distinguished member of the elite in and outside of campus, you must always go to church every single Sunday and confess yourself regularly. They view Jesuit colleges as full of unruly potheads.

May overlap with a wizarding school, boarding school of horrors or an occult-filled miskatonic university. Will undoubtedly overlap with politically motivated teacher.
