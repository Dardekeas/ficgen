When the verse is shaped by multiple creators, writing independently, many different comic book titles are set in a collective continuity. This makes it easy to have a cross over. In contrast, a single TV series with multiple writers is just the Verse with subcontractors. Likewise, when different continuities by the same author are tied together later by an intercontinuity crossover, that's canon welding.

The nature of the Shared Universe  multiple independent creators creating one continuity  can easily lead to a continuity snarl if it lasts a long time and the different creators don't take care to keep things straight. If a Shared Universe starts relying too heavily on continuity, especially if it's obscure or too reliant on each work in the Verse, a continuity lock-out may occur. When creators disagree on the direction the Verse should take, they may fight armed with canon. If some corners of the continuity are "off limits" to some characters to avoid theme-drift or plot derailing, then superman stays out of gotham.

When they go back centuries, and even further and further, long before copyrights and trademarks, the Shared Universe turns into one or more actual mythologies. Compare with the verse, expanded universe and canon. Contrast with shout-out.
