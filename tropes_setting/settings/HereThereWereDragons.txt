Once upon a time, there was magic. Kings had wizards as courtiers. Knights and saints slew dragons. Shame those days have gone by, huh?

Here There Were Dragons is the idea that the past was a time when magic was everywhere, as opposed to our boring old mundane present. This isn't a case where magic went underground or adopted some masquerade to avoid yet another witch hunt; no, this is a case where magic has disappeared almost entirely. But, who knows? It could always come back around again or at least the dragons could, if there were actual dragons...

Compare with götterdämmerung, where it's the gods that have left or died. See also the time of myths. If the story is about the magic going away it's, well, the magic goes away. See also end of an age.
