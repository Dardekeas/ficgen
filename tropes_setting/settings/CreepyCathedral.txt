So, you're up against the corrupt church. You know that they're lying to the people, but no one will listen to you. It's time to take matters into your own hands, storm their base and reveal them for the evil bastards they are.

There's just one little problem. That means you actually have to go in their Church. And that place is scary as Hell itself.

The Creepy Cathedral might not have the oomph of a good old haunted castle, and it might not seem to give off that scary dungeon aura...but there's just something about it that makes you think, "oh, crap!", the moment you go inside.

Bonus points if it's accompanied by organ music. Triple Word Score if it has ominous latin chanting. May have spooky nuns and creepy cool crosses at no extra charge.
