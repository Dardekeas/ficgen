Does the hero have a cool car? Then the hero needs a cool garage. The garage has to come up to the car's level. It's only fair.

If the cool car in your series is not bringing in the ratings, well... you forgot the cool garage.

The Cool Garage may come with its own resident gadgeteer genius to serve as a mechanic, if the cool car is so advanced that the hero cannot work on it himself.

An elaborate underground base or supervillain lair is frequently equipped with one of these. Indeed, many Cool Garages could just about serve as Elaborate Underground Bases, given an addition or two.

Some people attempt to build these in real life, in which case it may be referred to as a "Man Cave."
