Sometimes in fiction, the setting of a story has a significant impact on the shape and themes of the story. Other times, it's just scenery.

For example, a story set in India, but all the important characters are British residents with native Indian people only being seen as servants and other bit parts. Or a story about a Japanese tourist group sightseeing in the United States, and their interactions with each other, with Americans just filling out street scenes.

One of the key elements is that the story could be set in any other foreign country or exotic culture without doing violence to the script. The Japanese tourists could be sightseeing in Canada or Mexico instead, and all the writer needs to do is change the place namesâ€”it doesn't affect their romances and family struggles one bit.
