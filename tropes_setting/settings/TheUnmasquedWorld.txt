The paranormal exists; it's just very good at hiding. The masquerade has existed for centuries now, and the things that go bump in the night are just fine with that, thank you. They're not going to trouble humanity, and hopefully, humanity won't trouble them.

Then... something happens. Something so big, something so visible, that plausible deniability just won't cut it anymore. Maybe some young vampire walked into the sunlight in full view of a camera crew. Maybe two wizards got in a duel on Main Street. Or maybe everyone's just decided to "come out of the coffin." Either way, there's no going back. Welcome to a brave new world.

the unmasqued world is a world where the supernatural has, after years of hiding, revealed itself to the world, intentionally or otherwise. In many cases, this will lead to the integration of the supernatural into society â€” vampires on the police force, wizards in the hospital, werewolves in the park service. Expect much fantastic racism as not everyone's just going to accept that the traditional horror movie monsters have decided to move next door as roommates.

A common variant is a world like ours but where the supernatural exists and has always been known to the public. This will often involve alternate history in which supernatural forces influenced historical events.

Compare first contact, likely leads to post-modern magik. Compare the magic comes back for when magic stopped working some time in the past but started working again by the time the story takes place.

Spoiler warning: while this trope is a basic premise for most of the examples, it is the dramatic ending of others, in which case the series name alone is a spoiler.
