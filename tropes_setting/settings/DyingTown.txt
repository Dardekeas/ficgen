A town that has lost its main reason for existing, or the support systems it needs to thrive. As a result, it's losing its inhabitants far faster than they're replaced. If this continues to its logical end, this community will become a ghost town.

Easily spotted by the number of buildings that are shuttered or boarded up, particularly on its main thoroughfare. The streets are nearly empty of vehicles, and the grass hasn't been cut around quite a few houses. If you ask, the inhabitants will tell you nothing exciting ever happens here. At least not since the rutabaga factory burnt down, or the hot springs dried up, or Bigville got the freeway exit.

Most of the inhabitants will be older folks, safely retired or desperately holding on to what few remaining paying jobs there are. There are relatively few younger adultsâ€”most have fled to greener pastures, and the remaining ones are either dedicated to something in the town or resent being trapped by obligations. The teenagers and children are likewise mostly interested in leaving as soon as they can manage it, and woe betide the kid whose parents inexplicably decide to move to Dying Town from the big city.

May be the hometown of a cast member, and a visit to it will explain a lot about her. Sometimes overlaps with town with a dark secret, especially in the mystery and horror genres. A common plotline in more idealistic stories is for a new inhabitant to find some way of turning things around and restoring the town's prosperity, especially if it is a close-knit community that can rally around him. A more cynical twist has the newcomer promising this to con the remaining inhabitants out of their meager savings.

Contrast boom town, which it may once have been.
