It's tough being an orphan. No parents, no home and a large chance you'll be placed in the horrible orphanage of fear. But some fictional orphans get lucky, and go to the Orphanage of Love instead.

At the Orphanage of Love, there's enough food for all, and it tastes good. The rooms are spacious and well lit, the beds are soft and laundry is done frequently. The staff genuinely care about their charges and competently take care of them until good foster homes can be found for their precious angels. (Because no matter how wonderful the Orphanage of Love is, actual parents are even better.)

Mind you, employee screening isn't perfect, and sometimes a child hater will somehow get on the staff and abuse the orphans until he can be exposed. Also, money is generally in short supply, so the heroes will often have to raise a bundle of cash to keep the place running or avoid having it foreclosed on by a dastardly whiplash land developer. Expect the heroes of the story to try saving the orphanage through whatever wacky means necessary.
