Everybody in a small town is in on a secret. A terrible secret that nobody outside the town must know. The visiting protagonist slowly begins to suspect that something is wrong.

Such towns are often located in lovecraft country. If the terrible secret is covered up with a sweet veneer, see stepford suburbia and uncanny village. If it's big enough - say, a country or more - then you have yourself an empire with a dark secret.

("The Secret" doesn't have to be a supernatural one; it can be something as mundane as a murder cover-up.)

A wrong genre savvy character may take it for a close-knit community — or vice versa.
