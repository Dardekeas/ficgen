What's more fun than a carnival? It's got rides and games, frequently travels (though some don't, such as those of Coney Island), and is known for sideshows containing smaller acts than a circus (freaks, contortionists, and cabinets of curiosities). However, in some fiction they're cheap, bad ripoffs. The rides break, the games are rigged against you, and the magic acts are dishonest. The workers are creepy "carnies", too. These aren't places to have fun, they're only there to rip you off, not provide decent entertainment.

Related to souvenir land, but distinct in that this isn't asking for you to buy their merchandise. This carnival is too crappy to be a pastiche of Disneyland. Darker versions are amusement park of doom and circus of fear.
