What to do with criminals is a problem for societies real and fictional. One common solution in times past and perhaps future is the Penal Colony. This is a self-contained society consisting mostly of prisoners and those who guard them, usually separated from the civilized world by natural barriers in addition to (or instead of) prison walls; in science fiction, it may be a whole Prison Planet whose hat is an orange jumpsuit. Typically the prisoners will be required to do some sort of hard and dangerous labor; mining is a favourite in science fiction.

If the colony is fairly loosely controlled, isolated or has no guards at all, it will resemble a wretched hive, with the prisoners more or less running the place.

The Penal Colony can be a rich source of story ideas; if you're recruiting for a ragtag bunch of misfits, you might do it here. revolutionary leader captured by the empire and sent here? They may have to fight their way to the top of the prison hierarchy, then arrange an escape. Need a source of people you can dispose of without anyone caring? Have your xenomorph invade the Penal Colony. Is the place too loosely supervised? If so, it may become a base of operations for the big bad.

Compare wretched hive and death world (which may be what separates the Penal Colony from civilization). Particularly inescapable ones can overlap with the alcatraz or phantom zone. Often related to settling the frontier. See also reassigned to antarctica.
