This work is drowning in puns. The characters are dropping them left and right, and often the narrator (if there is one) will get in on the action, too. Worlds of Pun generally capitalize on a quirky brand of humor, with the puns as an integral feature of the work's appeal.

Compare world of ham and world of snark. Often includes punny names and pun based titles. See also hurricane of puns. For a character who frequently uses puns, see pungeon master.
