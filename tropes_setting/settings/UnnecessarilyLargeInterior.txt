A tendency of speculative fiction pictures and art direction to have interiors much larger than would be needed in reality. As in what could be a large room becomes huge and cavernous. Sometimes the story tries to justify this, claiming the phlebotinum needs this much empty space to work, but usually it's just because bigger is better (or because the higher the ceiling, the more stuff there is to drop down on the escaping heroes when the building collapses).

Usually it's so big, that if it was done in live action, it would be too expensive to do it as a set, or even architecturally impossible. Miniatures, matte backgrounds, or CGI would have to be used.

This can actually happen in nature, as spelunkers can attest, but even in Speculative Fiction art, this can be exaggerated.

Note that "Unnecessarily" is in the title for a reason. If there is an actual practical need for it to be that large, it doesn't count. The Galactic Senate building, in Star Wars, is not an example, because it's obviously to hold all of the senators from the many sectors of the Republic, sort of like a sports stadium. Neither is the Vehicle Assembly Building in Florida. It's large enough to have clouds form inside it on humid days, but it does have the purpose of building rockets, which need that much space.

Often associated with catholic cathedrals. May involve a mile-long ship or even a planet spaceship. Compare absurdly spacious sewer.
