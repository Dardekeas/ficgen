Initially, it looks like a standard role-playing game verse â€” but then the characters explicitly start referring to spot checks, hit points in stat-o-vision, roleplaying, always chaotic evil monsters, and other role-playing game terms. Is this an rpg in which the characters' players are weaving in and out of character and this is represented by the characters themselves speaking, or perhaps a video game which breaks the fourth wall more often than usual?

Nope - or at least it is not shown. the verse this takes place in really does work exactly like a tabletop RPG.

Because of the fourth wall-breaking implications, this usually happens only in comedies. Frequently takes place in a purely aesthetic era, especially for Fantasy games.
