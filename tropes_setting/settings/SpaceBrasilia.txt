In speculative fiction, the architecture of alien species will often be oddly uniform across the board, with no variations owing to different styles being in fashion at different times, local environment or available materials. Might also apply to futuristic human cultures: it is rare to see a future city with architecture from different periods side by side, despite this being the norm in real life. Of course, while real-life housing developments are uniform in style and age, one does not usually build entire cities from scratch like this. One notable exception is the city of Brasilia, which was built quickly in a uniform Modernist style to be a new showcase capital for Brazil (as were washington, dc, canberra and, even earlier, St.Petersburg and Constantinople) and has been criticized for its bland and antiseptic appearance (as the others named had been when their prevailing architecture was dated but not yet antique). See the "Future City" section at Tales of Future Past for more on this. Not to be confused with days of future past.

A special case of planet of hats: it would usually be too much work to give an alien species or future humans more than one architectural style. The shining city is usually described like this.

Compare crystal spires and togas, advanced ancient acropolis, city of gold. Contrast used future, the constant. Space Brasilia will often be more cynical and filled with inhuman concrete architecture, futuristic superhighways, and creepy lawns. Compare zeerust. Our heroes will long to return to the arcadia of good old planet Earth, which is never stepford suburbia.

When it is not city noir, your typical city in a bottle setting will usually be this. In which case it will be the hero's job to escape.

Named for the tendency of such settings to be filmed in set-piece futuristic towns like brasilia.
