Typically, this goes as follows:

 When we finally see the character's home culture, their distinctive set of exotic, quirky traits turn out to be their This sub-trope of planet of hats is known as planet of copyhats.

If the original quirky character manages to stand out from the rest of their people at all, it will often be because they've toned down their culture's hat to bring their behavior more in line with the ensemble, possibly citing that their species doth protest too much and thus turning out to be wearing a lampshade for a hat. Conversely, the trope may be partly psychologically justified when a fish out of water wears their hat proudly to uphold their cultural identity while living in a different culture.

If the culture is conceived from the start as having some specific distinguishing trait, and then characters are presented as specific examples of that culture, that's a standard planet of hats. See also a kind of one for cases where there's some ambiguity concerning whether the quirky character is just a character who is quirky or a perfectly average specimen of a quirky species.

Bonus points if it isn't even established until later on that an individual is part of some broader "race" as opposed to some unique entity.
