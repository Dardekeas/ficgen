Unlike tropes where travel between two world has a fixed time relationship like passing faster on one side or even when the relationship is loose, vague but still exists, the place beyond time is, as the name would suggest, a place that is defined by the fact that it has no internal sense of time nor a sense of when it should be accessible to the regular world. When a character enters such a place, they may meet another from their world's past or future who also, from their own point of view has just stepped inside. They can also often leave to any point in time.

The trope is often described quite literally as beyond time as though one has made a fifth dimensional movement to step outside normal time. Thus the place beyond time may also be a pocket dimension. Sometimes the place beyond time is actually a particular time- it is 10:42pm on the last day of the universe's existance but it will remain so as time stands still so the reason why people can go there and exit at any time is because getting there is time travel anyway.

In a time travel story, people in the place beyond time can expect to have ripple effect proof memories, and to be immune to timeline changes making them ret gone. Also expect time travel tense trouble if trying to discuss what's happening in the normal world. There can also be more than one.
