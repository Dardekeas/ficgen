A classic trope within Fairytales, the Bright Castle is a beautiful structure usually owned by a monarch, magician or powerful creature. It is picturesque, but sometimes cursed or with a dark secret. It can also be the home of the protagonist, who often must either leave the sanctuary, or save it from imminent doom.

The Bright Castle may also contain the macguffin, or deus ex machina that the heroes need. It can also represent an ordeal or trap that they must overcome to better both themselves and their cause. May also be a big fancy castle. Often a feature of the shining city.
