"In the far future, the [human group] fights a pitched battle against the mighty [alien name] Empire, but deep in the mysterious [region of space], among the ruins of the past, a darker threat looms."Does the above sentence sound familiar? It should. It's probably the single most popular space opera premise around. In fact, you could even call it the Standard Sci-Fi Setting. Typical features of the Standard setting include:

Examples come mostly from TV, Movies, and especially video games, where scientific accuracy often takes a back seat to awesome visuals and an engaging storyline. Compare sci-fi kitchen sink, which takes a Standard Sci-Fi Setting, then crams as many other speculative fiction tropes into it as it can.
