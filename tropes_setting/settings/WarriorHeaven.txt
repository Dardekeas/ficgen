sitting around all eternity playing a harp not your idea of paradise? reality without the bad parts sound a bit... dull? Some cultures, particularly of the proud warrior race variety, inspire their warriors with stories of a different afterlife. Those who fall in battle will go to a land of eternal, glorious war, their days spent fighting each other in friendly combat and their nights spent feasting, with any who fell earlier being resurrected at the day's end.

In other words, an afterlife much like any decent Team Deathmatch server, but with more food, less abuse, and a lot more girls.

Contrast hell is war, where a violent afterlife is a form of punishment. Of course, either can be interpreted as the other according on inidividual taste; see a hell of a time and a hell of a heaven.
