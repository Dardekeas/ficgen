Often discovered by a snooping hero, the secret underground passage is a popular trope in mystery and adventure-themed works. They are often a secret way of going from point A to point B without being detected, and are sometimes built into houses. If bad guys built it, then the secret underground passage is often used as a place to smuggle things and stash loot, or hide prisoners. If good guys built it, it's often a place to escape persecution, sneak past danger, or hide something important they don't want the bad guys to find.

This is sometimes discovered when the hero notices strange sounds - often human voices - and tries to find their source. Other times, it's discovered simply by accident when poking around, or even just leaning on the correct bookshelf and conveniently revealing the hidden passageway.

Sometimes the secret underground passage is not just a single passage, but links to a huge network of tunnels under the ground.

A staple of dungeon towns. Compare absurdly spacious sewer. Subtrope of secret passage.
