Scenes set in a city, including the establishing shot can be enormously fun for people who actually live there if they can nitpick details.

If the shot was actually filmed somewhere else entirely, it may quickly stop being fun and become headache-inducing, especially if it involves something like the mountains of illinois.

Not to be confused with hollywood atlas.
