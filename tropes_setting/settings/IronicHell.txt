Most depictions of hell involve some form of eternal punishment for the damned souls who are sent there. In ironic hell, they get a more personal service. Each sinner gets a punishment that is an ironic reminder of the sins of which he or she is guilty. A glutton might be force-fed something unpleasant for eternity (a common version is that they're fed something they enjoyed - ceaselessly, becoming wholly sick of it, for eternity), or might be prevented from eating ever again.

Many examples of Ironic Hell are references to Dante's Inferno (Book 1 of The Divine Comedy), which depicts Hell in this way. It was published in 1314; however, the basic idea goes back even further, to Greek myths of Tartarus, for example with Tantalus.

It may be worth noting that, despite Dante's work being mainly a sociopolitical statement and not supposed to be taken as a literal journey through the afterlife, people still presumed that he knew what he was talking about and have used his often sanctimonious depictions of Hell, what acts are sinful, and how sinful they are, taken directly from his writings.

Your Lit professor would probably call this "Contrappasso", Italian for "counter-suffering", which means "the punishment fits the crime."

Often coupled with self-inflicted hell and/or the punishment is the crime.
