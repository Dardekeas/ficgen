A giant timepiece, visible throughout its locale. Beloved of hunchbacks, of villains who need their capes to billow dramatically, and of snipers with poor tactical sense. Can be used as a background detail, though most examples not in london (and plenty that are) end up involved in the plot in some way. One may be used to increase the suspense in a race against the clock, act as the home or base for the main characters, or become the stage for a fight scene or climbing climax.

Scenes on a Clock Tower often include:

 Characters nervously perching on the ledge invariably located above the clock face. For whatever reason, escaped parrots are also like to perch here. Odds are good somebody will fall, in which case...

Bonus points for the movement of the hands being used for dramatic tension as they slowly tick into a position that would dump the hero off to his doom. Sometimes this effect is used by the villain as a deathtrap. Villains in this position may be  If inside, there will be plenty of gears and other mechanisms, or at least a rope to ring the bell. Expect a stadium sized chamber full of spur gears the size of Volkswagens, on and about which the hero and villain The Palace of Westminster Clock Tower shows up the most of any real tower; it is more often referred to as Big Ben, the nickname of its main bell (it has five).

This trope is extremely prevalent in real life. Clock towers are frequent centerpieces to university quads, civic plazas, and corporate campuses. Used mostly for aesthetic appeal in modern times. Please list only the famous ones under the real life section above.

Aka cathedral climax, a subtrope of climbing climax. If someone climbs up one of these with a weapon in real life, duck. See also for doom the bell tolls.
