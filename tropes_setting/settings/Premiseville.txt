Welcome to Premiseville, Fictionland, where every city has a meaningful name. In certain works, especially kids shows or more whimsical speculative fiction the city of adventure, the place where our heroes live has a name that fits the premise, feel or ethos of the show.

For example, Dimmsdale in The Fairly Oddparents is well-named because the residents of said city are quite stupid by and large. Soap City in The Cramp Twins is also well named as the residents are obsessed with cleanliness to a frankly scary degree (and there's a Soap Factory there). Ponyville from the My Little Pony series is named such because its inhabitants are all... well, you can probably figure it out by yourself...

Sometimes a name is chosen against the theme of the show, which is still an example of this trope rather than a subversion because it is still using this trope but in an ironic manner. The most famous example of this would be Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
