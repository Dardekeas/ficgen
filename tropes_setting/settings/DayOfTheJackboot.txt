fascists, commies, theocrats and other assorted scary people live far, far away from your country. There's no way that they could take it over.

This trope is when those wacky nazis, dirty communists or people who look and act suspiciously like either of them take over the protagonist's country or hometown. Communism is a less common target for this now, thanks to the great politics mess-up.

See also invaded states of america and oppressive states of america for something specific to the United States - columns of foreign troops marching down Pennsylvania Avenue can be a very powerful image when the last time this happened was 200 years ago.

Compare people's republic of tyranny.
