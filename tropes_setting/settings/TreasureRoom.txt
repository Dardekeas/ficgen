A staple of role playing games, video games, movies, TV, and wherever stories are told. A big room full of treasure... money, gold and jewels. Usually not organized very well, it's all just piled in together like an episode of Hoarders: Filthy Rich Edition. Often the mcguffin. Often trapped or guarded by a monstrous beast, most frequently a dragon. Often a cause of laser-guided karma due to all the death by materialism. Sometimes the hero might get all of it, but generally they only manage a choice piece or two, if anything. In many scenarios there will be some sort of cave-in, massive flood, or other such death trap which will inevitably chase the hero/heroes out. And since it would only take a few days or maybe a week to dig it back out, the treasure is clearly lost forever. Apparently adventurers have never heard of modern excavation equipment.

May overlap with pooled funds or dragon hoard. See also city of gold.
