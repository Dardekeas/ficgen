Every building housing a top secret operation seems to have a "beyond top secret floor". There's no obvious button for it in the elevators, you can't reach it by stairs, and of course nobody has ever heard of it. Most realistic is a sub-basement, but it could also be higher than the highest official floor, or even squeezed in between floors â€” though in the last two cases, it's questionable how they've managed to keep it hidden at all, since anyone looking out a window could get suspicious. Typically either magic or sufficiently advanced technology is involved in keeping such a floor hidden. Finding it is a major plot point. It might have been closed off long ago (since it houses a Dark Secret) or it's still being used by the Beyond Top Secret club. In any case, don't expect to just walk in here, not even if you do have security clearance.

While it could technically be any number, thirteen is a fairly common choice.
