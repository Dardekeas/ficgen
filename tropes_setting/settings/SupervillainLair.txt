Every up-and-coming super villain aspires to create a particularly cool supervillain lair. It may be an elaborate underground base, an old castle (preferably atop a craggy mountain peak in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a perpetual lightning storm), an underwater complex, an evil tower of ominousness, a volcanic isle, a space station, a corporate office building, a bfc at the end of world 8 (in video games anyway) among other possibilities, but if you really want to be a cut above lesser villainous contemporaries you make it a floating fortress or an airborne aircraft carrier. It will generally be stocked with most or all of the following:
