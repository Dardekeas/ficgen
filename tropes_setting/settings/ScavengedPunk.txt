scavenged punk is a stylized setting that focuses on technology and culture based on an unusual source: scavenged junk. Weapons, tools, clothing, and sometimes entire cities will be built out of repurposed materials. A key factor here is that said materials, often pieces of trash, are being used for something other than their original purpose (as opposed to simply being repaired and reused). This trope shows up almost exclusively in two cases.

Firstly, it's used for after the end set stories in scavenger worlds where supplies are short and hence items from the past civilization must be used for basic necessities. scavenged punk specifically crops up when improvised armor (or post-apunkalyptic armor) and improvised weapons are emphasized.

Secondly, it shows up in stories where beings smaller than human (rodents, bugs, lilliputians, etc.) have urban civilizations and use materials scavenged or stolen from humans. Many stories with anthropomorphic animals will have this to an extent as part of a mouse world, but only when it's strongly emphasized does it really become scavenged punk.

In either case (but especially the second), this trope is often made to be extremely visually interesting as random objects are put to surprising practical (or not) new uses. Because of this visual focus, scavenged punk has been common as scenery porn in animation especially recent cgi films.

When technology is constructed in a much more limited capacity it is simply macgyvering. Note that while scavenged punk is not exclusively a fiction trope, most real life examples fall under macgyvering or scavenger world. Also contrast with bamboo technology where technology is built from rudimentary natural materials but not junk.
