A comedic deserted island that is circular with a radius of two metres or so and a single palm, coconut or pineapple tree in the centre. Usually has a single inhabitant. If there's more than one, they'll either be constantly arguing or one will be slowly driving the other insane in a comedic manner (meat-o-vision may also occur). Often features a message in a bottle.

Should not be confused with those larger, seemingly-deserted islands with a resort on the side far from where the characters landed.

please don't think about where the lone inhabitant is getting enough food and fresh water to live long enough to grow that spectacular beard. Or even how they survive high tide.
