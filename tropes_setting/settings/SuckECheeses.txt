One for the stock parodies: an obvious pastiche of chuck e. cheese's, a combination pizza restaurant and "family fun" center. It's the home of arcade games, ball pits, bad pizza, creepy costumed characters, and really horrific animatronics. A fun place for kids? More like a fate worse than death for parents.

The chain was created by Nolan Bushnell, the founder of atari. It reached its heyday in the 1980s, but also suffered bad publicity as a hunting ground for sexual predators and, in the late 2000's, as a stomping ground for adult brawls. It has inspired a number of knock-offs throughout the country (and even an adult version in Dave & Buster's), which (except for D&B) have gone into similar decline. Similar properties exist outside the US, including the UK's Wacky Warehouse, though they rarely make their way into media.Note that not all examples are terrible; some are rather awesome and kids will do anything to go there. (May still qualify as hell-on-earth for their hapless parents and the equally hapless teenage employees, though.)
