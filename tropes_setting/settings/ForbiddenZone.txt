In speculative fiction, there is always at least one area with a foreboding name that nobody goes to. Ever. Whether it's an impassable swamp, an asteroid field, a city rumored to be haunted, a monster-infested mountain passage or simply a place the elders have declared off limits, this is the place everybody knows you only go to when you're insane.

So, naturally, the heroes will inevitably wind up going there â€” whether by choice or circumstance. What good is having something that's mysteriously off limits if we can't go there and see why it's off limits? chances are the dangers are completely exaggerated anyway, right?

It will either turn out that the forbidden zone is indeed incredibly dangerous, or that there's no danger at all, and the heroes were supposed to keep out because it contains forbidden knowledge. Or both. In either case, the heroes will pass through more or less unscathed, and they may even figure out a way to make the zone less forbidden.

Compare forbidden fruit, schmuck bait. The dangerous kind of forbidden zone overlaps with death world.

Not to be confused with Forbidden Zone, a danny elfman film.
