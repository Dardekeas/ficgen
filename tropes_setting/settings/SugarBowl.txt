A sugar bowl is a setting in a story that is lively and happy and where bad events rarely, if ever, happen. Any place with friendly locals (human or not), idyllic landscapes, rustic yet hygienic towns, and no poverty is likely a Sugar Bowl.

There is no antagonist. The only villians here are harmless villains. Sometimes you can have a sweet setting with unexpectedly creepy and/or evil bad guys, but even in that case, the kind of permanent damage they can do is likely minor. Expect a heel-face turn via care bear stare and/or defeat means friendship.

They're often intended to be a utopia, so don't worry about the details.Be advised that proximity to, prolonged stays within, or merely entering such places may "naturalize" you into a local in body and/or mind.

Compare with: level ate, which covers settings that are literally made out of sugar. Contrast with crapsack world, the mirror universe of this trope. crapsaccharine world appears to be this, but turns out to be crapsack world. Also, sugar apocalypse, where bad things happen to good universes. Not to be confused with tastes like diabetes, which is a reaction.we have one of these. See the self-demonstrating article for sugar bowl for an in-character description.

not to be confused with the macguffin in A Series of Unfortunate Events, or the hangout spot in the Arthur series (the animated TV show, not the films), or with the collegiate american football game held annually in new orleans on or around January 1st or The Super Bowl, or with the California ski resort of the same name, or with a two-handled porcelain bowl sitting on a dining table that contains granulated sucrose.
