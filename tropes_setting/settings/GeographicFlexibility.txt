The geography of a fictional location becomes extremely flexible as more and more is added to it.

The most common way this occurs is when the story is set in an ostensibly small town. Small towns have their advantages for fiction, but they may not have every location the plot requires. The plot calls for a dock, so the town has one. The plot calls for a university, and it's there. The plot calls for an industrial district, and it's there. None of this is inherently unreasonable, since many small towns do have those, or are even built around them. But having all of them? Suddenly the town's not looking so small anymore.

In egregious cases, the city of adventure may gain or lose major geographic features like mountains, or may move to a different climate zone when no one's looking.

places whose location are never given are particularly prone to this. Compare chaos architecture, traveling at the speed of plot.
