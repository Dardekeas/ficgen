Any dictionary will give you this much:

n: An ideally perfect place, especially in its social, political, and moral aspects.

Easy enough. Let's write one! First, you come up with a socially perfect place with a flawless political process. A little difficult, but you'll get there. Now figure out what "moral" means well enough to refine it to an absolute. Hey, it was tough, but you came through in the end.

Now get everyone to agree with you.

Yeah. We can't help you with that part.

In fact, it is so much easier to get people to agree with what is wrong with a place that most social-commentary settings fall into the dystopia category. When a brave author does attempt a Utopian setting it seems to come from a need to grind a particular axe. Thus we get libertarian/conservative/progressive utopias, religious utopias, communal utopias, and other philosophic one-note offerings, each with its own collection of people attesting they would rather die than live there. It helps that the word itself was created to mean such a place can't possibly exist because it's that good.

The downfall of a utopia in the main character's eyes will most likely be seeing the inevitable, thorough suppression of individuality. How else could everybody get along all the time? Even in individualistic utopias, the supposedly rugged individualists who compose the perfect society have a suspicious tendency to agree on everything (or at least everything political) and act in similar ways. The end of violent conflict seems to require uniformity.
