Dumps and junkyards are a common setting for fights, club houses, secret meetings, and the various other fantastic situations fictional characters get themselves into. There's something about dumpsâ€” everything there is dirty, old, worn out, broken. Symbolically, it's a place of decay; pragmatically, there's lots of junk to play with, and it can be broken or blown up without having to worry about property damage.

Expect towering columns of crushed cars and neat piles of assorted garbage, perfect for hiding behind; a giant magnet or claw that can be easily operated by someone without training; a conveyor belt-o-doom leading into a crushing machine or incinerator; plenty of trash talk; and brown.

Taken to extremes, this idea can lead to an all-out landfill beyond the stars. Our heroes might end up here after escaping via trash landing. See also trash of the titans. Not to be confused with sadness tropes.
