Once the bold explorers have finished their job and found some exotic new lands or strange new worlds, it's time to take advantage and start a colony or settlement!

There are many reasons why people might choose to leave everything they know behind and set off to carve a new life out of an untamed wilderness. They might be seeking freedom, opportunity, or wealth. They might be fleeing an intolerable situation: intolerance, overcrowding, or debt. They may simply have no choice in the matterâ€”far off lands are such a convenient place to store your criminals, dissidents, and other unwanted population.

The dangers in settling new territory are great: hostile terrain, hostile wildlife, hostile natives, bad weather, lack of readily accessible resources, and much more. You may end up cut off from your homeland completely. Success is never guaranteed, and many settlements will fail, often with great loss of life. Nevertheless, the biological urge to expand and grow is strong, and new colonies will rarely lack for volunteers (or "volunteers"). Successful colonies can even end up matching or exceeding their homeland in power or resources, leading to plenty of opportunities for conflict.

And what about those natives, or small green creatures, who live where you've planned to plant new roots? I guess they'll just have to take their chances. Of course, if you are one of the natives (or small green creatures), living where someone has decided to settle, you may not be very pleased with the notion. If you can't talk them out of the idea, then it's possible that this means war!This trope tends to be a big part of American and Australian self-identity and mythos, though it is, of course, not limited to America or Australia.

See also: cult colony, lost colony, penal colony, injun country. Related to the migration. May serve as a mere setting for a work, or be an active element of the plot. Works in this setting often involve the pioneer or the determined homesteader.
