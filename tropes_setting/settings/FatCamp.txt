A summer camp where overweight and obese children are sent to lose weight. Of course the children's parents are oblivious to what actually goes on in fat camp.

drill sergeant nasties are everywhere, pushing the kids to their limit. The children constantly have to run up hills and the food is so scarce it could starve the kids to death, provided that they don't sneak candy into their rooms.

Treatment is so bad that the kids will eventually plan a great escape, in which the camp councillors will use the same methods that prison guards will use to recapture escapees.

This is not true of real fat camps of course, which always use positive reinforcement, and attempt to teach the children healthy eating habits, instead of starving them. They are called, the more politically correct, fitness and weight loss camps, and now also allow teens and adults to attend.

Some of the stereotypes of fat camp are truth in television, however. Especially the running up the hill part.
