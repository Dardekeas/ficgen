In the World Of Badass, every character is a badass... even the girliest girly-girl will be a butt-kicking action girl, even the nerdiest of nerds will be a badass bookworm, far from dying first the black dude will be the guy you least want to mess with, and you should probably just steer clear of gays altogether. May or may not be rated m for manly, after all badassery comes in many shapes, personalities and sizes.

Obviously, this is a dangerous place to be and will often overlap with crapsack world and/or death world not only because of said danger but also because such worlds are fertile breeding grounds for the black and gray morality that so often inspires true badassery. This can lead to anti-hero, anti-villain and heel-face revolving door characters popping up at frequent intervals. Other common character archetypes include the cowboy cop, crazy survivalist, determinator and blood knight.

Frequently overlaps with everyone is armed. Compare everyone is a super, had to be sharp.

If the main protagonist of a World of Badass has a love interest, expect them to become (or, in some cases, start out as) a battle couple. If they have kids, it's best to avoid messing with said kids. in fact, the kids may well be able to take care of themselves.The World of Badass will occasionally, due to the comparably high level of hsq, overlap with the world of ham and adventure-friendly world. However, it's also possible for this trope to be applied to crapsack or dystopian worlds where every character is a badass out of necessity, see had to be sharp.
