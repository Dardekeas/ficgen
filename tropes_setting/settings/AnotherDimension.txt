A very, very old trope, still used today. Another Dimension refers to universes that are "next" to our own, which require magic or high-end technology to travel to and from. In theory, from our world they are in a direction other than the directions we are familiar with.

This term is actually used wrong (and let's not talk about "parallel dimensions", which is a contradiction in its own right). What we usually know as another dimension could be called a "parallel space" in a fourth (or other-th) dimension: that fourth dimension would be the set of all existing alternate spaces.

alternate universes are often just a variety of Another Dimension. Unlike AUs, though, other dimensions don't necessarily have to resemble the "home" universe. There may be a void between the worlds to go through.

Travel to and from another dimension is usually via some sort of door, vortex, portal, gate, window â€” the exact term depends on the story. Sometimes some kind of teleportation suffices. Characters might need the aid of weirdness search and rescue to get home. Entering the dimension can sometimes be used as an extradimensional shortcut.

Despite 'dimension' being a relatively new term for it, the concept is older than dirt. The "fairy lands" of celtic mythology and European fairy tales, the various universes of Hindu cosmology, hell, heaven and the underworld, and so on.
