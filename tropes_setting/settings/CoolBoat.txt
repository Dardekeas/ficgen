Pretty self-explanatory. What the cool car and tank goodness is to the road, the cool plane is to the sky, and the cool starship is to space, the cool boat is to water, whether it's a steamship, a sailing ship, or a submarine. A sufficiently large cool boat may also serve as headquarters for the characters. If the hero's primary place of residence is a boat that the hero owns and can take wherever he wants, that's a houseboat hero.

On the "boat" vs. "ship" thing: A boat is something you can lift out of the water and place on the deck of a ship. (Except submarines are boats, a tradition dating back to the early submarines, which were invariably tiny enough that they could be placed on the deck of a ship. Tenders usually are too, no matter how big they are.) And remember, it's not an it, she's a she. (Except for if you're Russian. Or Spanish.) Expect to get called on this by hardcore Navy types.

Under no circumstances confuse this with a nice boat... which is something entirely different and more disturbing. Though it may depend if you like the boat....
