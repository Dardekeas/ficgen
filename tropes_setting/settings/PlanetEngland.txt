Goes hand in hand with expansion pack world. You have a Magical Land that's about the size of England, since it's mostly medieval european fantasy. Let's call it "Magicalandia". You want to expand the world to do more stories, more locations and more fantasy counterpart cultures. But what to call the world now that you can see beyond the borders of one country?

Simple! Fans are so used to the name already, that you can also call the world Magicalandia! Of course, the original country will remain the center of the fictional universe.

Thus, we have the country of Magicalandia on the planet of Magicalandia. Which is equivalent to a real-world country changing its name to "Earth" or planet "Earth" being dubbed "England", as in the trope's name.
