When a great battle, massacre, or terrible cataclysm occurs, the people involved may someday forget, but in some cases the land doesn't. Sometimes a place becomes contaminated, or possessed, by the misery that transpired there. Vegetation fails to grow, beasts and birds become sick or mad. The land is cursed, forbidden and dangerous.

A Corpse Land is called this mostly because the bodies of the dead are ever present. No matter how many are buried, more seem to just appear, still bloody and disease-ridden, attracting scavengers that become puppets of the ghosts that haunt the place. In fantasy stories, necromancers are drawn to such locations, and no matter how noble the armies involved may have been, they become twisted and malevolent, even attempting to re-enact their final moments with travelers who pass by.

A hidden form of this may be a field of blades. See also atop a mountain of corpses, nothing but skulls.
