A full-fledged city that lies beneath the earth. It's a civilian form of elaborate underground base and comparable to an underwater city. The underground city is more than a collection of refugees hiding in abandoned sewer and subway tunnels, it has markets, mines, homes and possibly even farms (either of mushrooms and stranger fare or sophisticated hydroponics).

Typically these cities come in a few flavors:

   It is possible that these varieties be combined. For example: a Buried City may still be inhabited and serve as an Apocalypse Bunker, or an Inhuman Borough built by aliens as an Apocalypse Bunker.

The underground city is very often a hidden elf village and is only rarely part of a larger network of interconnected cities. Usually each is a one of a kind sovereign and isolated city state. In contrast, one way in which our dwarves are all the same is that they tend to live in a network of underground cities.

In videogames, these can be an underground level.
