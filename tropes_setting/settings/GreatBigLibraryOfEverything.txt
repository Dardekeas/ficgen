A library that contains practically any possible/concievable information source known to man (or some other intelligent/sapient species), if not a multitude of intelligent species . This labyrinthian library seems to be a natural breeding spot for macguffins and it has just about all of life's secrets and answers. The great big book of everything, big book of war, reality-writing book, portal book, and chronoscopes along with other things can all be found here. Because of its wealth of knowledge, the library is a very valuable information resource for the main cast. May be a magical library as well, which could go a long way into justifying its often unreal/absurd level of comprehensiveness.

Often times this is guarded by a magic librarian or other force. Sometimes there will be a struggle with another group trying to obtain the same information, sometimes in a physical fight, but just as often with a battle of wits. If you're lucky, you'll find what you need. If you're not, it may turn out to be a blank book all along.

In many works, this setting is either very hard to get to, long forgotten, or rumoured to be a myth. In sci-fi and high fantasy works, however, the library can be quite well publicized, and it's sometimes a big tourist destination.

Please note that the library must not be split up into multiple smaller libraries but instead be a continuous entity. So you can have a huge connected library, but not a bunch of smaller branches.
