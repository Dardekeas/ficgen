An exotic street bazaar from arabian nights days, juiced up on nonsensteroids. All manner of strange, unearthly, forbidden, and fantastic items can be found in a Bazaar of the Bizarre. Usually, the rules of a truce zone are in effect, and sworn enemies can meet safely there (though arriving and leaving can be tricky). This may just be sacred custom, or may be enforced by functional magic or other applied phlebotinum.

Often encountered by the heroes early on, to drive home the otherworldliness of a place and establish that anything can happen. If the characters are traveled enough, they may own a small version themselves as a trophy room. Modern day fairy tales set in cities often feature a fairy market appearing as the bazaar.

Compare with the the little shop that wasn't there yesterday (when the bazaar vanishes), museum of the strange and unusual, secret government warehouse, kitsch collection, inn between the worlds, and heroes r us. The trope namer is Fritz Leiber's short story "Bazaar of the Bizarre," although the 'bazaar' of that story is actually the little shop that wasn't there yesterday with a sinister twist.

Contrast with grail in the garbage (which might be found in the bazaar's trash heap).
