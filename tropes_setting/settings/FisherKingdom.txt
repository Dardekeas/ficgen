The places we live, work and play in have an effect on us. Usually it's subtle, and in fact it's far likelier that we end up changing the environment to suit our own needs. Not in this place, though. Maybe it's deeply infused with magic, or perhaps the universe itself has a different set of natural laws. Either way, the place changes you, mentally or physically.

Compare fisher king, in which the land changes to reflect its ruler (and/or vice versa).
