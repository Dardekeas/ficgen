In the standard sci fi setting, trade is common between star systems. Sometimes to survive a planet becomes so specialized that focuses on a certain commodity or service. Maybe its building weapons or providing doctors. Whatever it is, the world trades this resource with other planets, becoming renowned for the export.

This trope isn't about a single planetville; It focuses on the big picture on how individual worlds interact with each other. Subtrope of planet of hats, though any location (an asteroid, small moon, space colony) can serve as this. Compare/Contrast single-biome planet.

Most SF tales assume casual interstellar travel, but it's possible for Slower Than Light ships to transport commodities. But the items being traded would be of extreme value to justify the high cost and long wait. It also often crops up if the setting is confined to a single solar system, which is slightly easier to justify as it only requires somewhat casual interplanetary travel to justify.

Well done versions of the trope will explain that a planet is widely known for its major export, while its other industries are neither profitable nor popular. It could also be used for comedic effect, by exaggerating it to the point of absurdity.

Economics aside, a planet has other values: political, cultural, religious, and military. The importance of the export directly influences the importance of the planet. For example, the Planet of Phlebotinum would have a lot of power and an armada protecting it. However, the Planet of Toasters would lack any economic influence and maybe warrants a corvette for protection. Meanwhile, the Planet of Judges Robes and Powdered Wigs would have political clout, but lack economic influence. The amount of protection relies on how much influence they have with their neighbors.

May correlate with multipurpose monocultured crop, if the One Product is farmed instead of manufactured.
