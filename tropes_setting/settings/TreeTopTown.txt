A village built, as the name suggests, entirely out of treehouses. Rope bridges typically connect the structures to one another, and ladders are typically used to access the community from ground level. dangling creepers may also be used for transport.

A common form of bamboo technology, although more magical versions can be seen as well. Can often be found within the lost woods.

wood elves are frequent inhabitants of such a place, and it has become a often-used version of the hidden elf village. Often, undying or otherwise long-lived elves may outlive the trees and have to relocate every few decades or centuries.

Compare treehouse of fun and arboreal abode.
