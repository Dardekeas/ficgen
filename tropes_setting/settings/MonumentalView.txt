A location with an unlikely vista. It may be a home where none were built or beyond the income of the characters, a geographically or geologically implausible location, beyond their security clearance, or from a building that simply has not been constructed at that location and is unlikely to ever be.

The characters aren't just passing it and it is not an establishing shot is giving you a quick look at the identifying feature- the characters actually have a view from a perspective that it is impossible or extremely unlikely for them to obtain, usually from their alleged residence.

Does not generally involve monumental damage. Related to the eiffel tower effect.
