The elephant's graveyard is a legend regarding a place where elephants instinctively go when nearing the end of their days. It was often featured in stories where an evil poacher would look for this place, seeking to claim its stores of ivory, and the protagonist would have to protect this sacred place.

It also makes a very impressive and gloomy set pieces, as your heroes walk in-between the giant skeletons.

The origin of the trope is not certain. While elephants do not "look" for a place to die, during periods of famine, they will gather around sources of food and water, and as those get depleted, die there. It is also noted that older elephants whose teeth have worn out seek out soft water plants and eventually die near watering holes, perhaps also causing this myth.

Another possible reason is that elephants(and creepy crows) are the only non-hominids to have shown death rituals. Elephants recognize elephant skeletons for what they are, and will rub the bones with their trunks. Elephants unrelated to the deceased have been noted to visit the graves. They also sometimes treat human bodies and skeletons with odd respect. the other wiki has an article on this.

In speculative fiction, it's not rare for elephant to be substituted for some very big creature, giving us "Dragon Graveyards" or "space whale Graveyards" or something similar.

Contrast with derelict graveyard, the machine counterpart. See also creepy cemetery.
