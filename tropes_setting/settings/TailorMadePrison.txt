A personal alcatraz made with special precautions to stop this one person from escaping. If he has a super power, then it likely incorporates either a power nullifier or mechanisms that are power-proof.

eventually he'll break out but to be fair to the prison's designer, the villain usually can't escape on his own.

He gets some help from his henchmen, some unwitting pawn, or an ill-advised upstart villain exploiting the prison's fantastic fragility. The purpose of the Tailor-Made Prison in a story is usually one to give a villain street cred: he must be really bad to merit it. Also, a previous big bad can be considered to be commuting on a bus when in the prison. He's being kept around with a plausible reason for him to be cooling his heels instead of raising hell and can be sprung out when dramatically convenient. Considering that any villain who merits such attention very likely has joker immunity in a world of cardboard prisons, the builders of the place may be fully aware that this is temporary solution but hope it will give them, at least, a few months of peace.

There are generally skeletons — back story red shirts — hanging about to indicate that this is not a normally escapable place.

Sometimes this is the purpose of the phantom zone. Compare sealed evil in a can for those immortal villains who can't be held by a mere custom-designed prison but can overlap if their can is custom made. Compare also shipped in shackles, which is the mobile version of this trope. For added psychological trauma, may be paired with the aloner. Sometimes combined with gilded cage. See also crystal prison for a common cage.

cardboard prisons occur when this happens way too often and way too easily.
