The Wacky Homeroom occurs when a show centers around a particular class and the teacher and the students have distinctly quirky personalities. Sometimes the focus of the series is more on the teacher, and sometimes it's more on the student. Either way, the personalities are intentionally blown up and caricature-ish in order to help bring more interest to an otherwise mundane setting.

If the show focuses more on the teacher, expect to see cases of sensei-chan, the absentminded professor, and/or the misplaced kindergarten teacher heading up the group. If the focus is on the students, the students may make up the five-man band archetype or perhaps many of them will be cloudcuckoolanders with an only sane man thrown in to represent the viewer and/or contrast all the wackiness. Either way, hijinks ensue.
