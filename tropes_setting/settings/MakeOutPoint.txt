A standard teenage hang out where all sorts of canoodling takes place in cars. Usually features a father and/or police finding young people there to "break it up" and drag people back home. Depending on the broadness of the comedy (and the innocence — or lack thereof — of the setting), don't come a-knockin' may be in play.

Often involves a tourist-trap-type scenic bluff, so as to overlook the city lights at night... as if you're looking at that when you're up here. Also a standard set up for death by sex in horror movies, as the people in the car are... distracted, to say the least. Similarly, it seems being at make-out point makes you immediately a weirdness magnet — the first people to see the falling meteor, the mutant escapee, or the alien invasion force tends to be such a couple; see terror at makeout point.

Often in the fifties, the makeout place is a drive-in theater.
