Welcome to Troperia, a kingdom of high magic, higher science, and infinite wonder, splendor, and power. Our legion of magic knights patrol the countryside, our fleet of science police guard the sky, and the wise child queen rules with justice and compassion. Pity, we just got taken over by a couple of dozen mooks and their talking dinosaur overlord.

This is the Easily Conquered World. A place where the good guys' military (if they even have one) never manages to hinder the bad guys, palace security is so lax that somebody could casually sneak into the queen's bedroom and trot off with her over their shoulder, and a glorified laser blade is considered powerful enough to ensure world domination to whoever holds it.

One has to ask "Why did this happen? How did this happen?" If it isn't for the sake of humor, then it's likely part of an idiot plot : the princess has to be kidnapped, and the army must fail to stop the big bad. Otherwise, why would they need the hero's help? To reformulate their tax codes?

Enabling this is the fragile set up of the skeleton government, where militaries are useless and the guards must be crazy. Often related to the law of conservation of detail : the most we know about the Kingdom's struggles against the invaders, the less likely they are to just consist in a series of quick defeats, because it would negate all the tension of narrating it. On the other hand, when the battles are just evoked, stating that the villains won them all makes a bigger threat of them and thus creates more tension when fighting them again.

Compare and contrast easily thwarted alien invasion. justified trope when the invasion is performed by an outside-context villain, or just a very, very powerful one.

no real life examples, please!
