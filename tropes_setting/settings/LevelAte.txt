For some reason, creators seem fond of designing settings that are literally made out of food. Indeed, stemming from the oral tradition, it is clearly older than print â€” and possibly much older.

Obviously, these sorts of settings tend to have a rather whimsical or silly nature. don't spend too much time thinking about where that river of milk is coming from, why it hasn't spoiled, how those pastry buildings stay up, or how that moon made of cheese could form.

A fairly popular subtrope is to focus on sweets, probably in part because the concept of a land made of confectionery already has a certain amount of stock symbolism invested in it. cheese is also popular. Older variants, stemming from times when food shortages were commonplace, tended to have more variety in the foodstuffs. Its inhabitants, if there are any, might be anthropomorphic food themselves.

Video Game creators are especially fond of using this trope, particularly in lighter and fluffier games.

Not to be confused with the level where you are ate. See also giant food, edible theme naming, gingerbread house.
