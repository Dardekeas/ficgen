This is less a world shape, and more a series of world pieces. Landmasses, with or without internal seas, float suspended in an atmosphere. They can range in size from tiny "islands" to huge continents with vast civilizations.

Impossible under physics resembling ours, worlds of this type are usually found exclusively in fantasy. What keeps them hovering? Where does the gravity come from? What's keeping the atmosphere in place? nobody knows, but maybe a wizard did it. Do not expect the outcome of falling off the side of one of these pieces to be properly explored.

Compare shattered world, for broken worlds  and floating continent, which usually exists in a more normal world with people also living on the surface below. See also the sky is an ocean, which is almost always used in worlds like these. Also, ocean punk, for an actual ocean, can sometimes be a post-apocalyptic earth.
