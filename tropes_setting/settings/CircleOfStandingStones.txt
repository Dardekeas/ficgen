Stone Circles are rings of large stones erected by stone-age cultures. Their purpose is often unknown, though there are many theories, owing to humanity's ongoing fascination with things it doesn't understand. They are also visually distinctive, tending to command attention wherever they appear, and the circular arrangement is easily identified, simple in appearance, but clearly not natural.

Perhaps this is why whenever a circle of standing stones, stones that tower over the area, appear in fiction they wind up being significant somehow. The mysterious nature of these places causes writers to associate them with magic, and have them be a place of power. Or it might be left ambiguous whether the stones are magical or just stones. Others will portray them as a sacred place for whatever culture built them, and may beg the question, are they still around? At times they are simply used as a dramatic backdrop, their imposing presence lending weight, literally at times, to the events that are taking place.

When one appears in a work expect strange occurances, alien encounters, the reveal, a plot twist, or the climax to occur in or around the circle. If it is used as a portal of some kind it overlaps with cool gate.
