A fate worse than death that in some stories happens after death, just as fluffy cloud heaven is the theme park version of heaven, Fire And Brimstone Hell is the Theme Park version of hell. Generally, if it isn't an ironic hell, the bloody bowels of hell or a hell of a time, it's this. And even then, you can expect the odd brazier and stalactite.

Common features of a fire and brimstone hell include underground cavern-like decor, plenty of hellfire and lava, and red-skinned devils with horns and tails poking the souls of sinners around with their pitchforks. Sometimes, it's actually shown to be underground literally, but most of the time it's another dimension.

Note the curious discrepancy; despite rebelling against God, devils in hell are doing some kind of job with awe-inspiring diligence and consistency. This job arguably makes Hell someplace someone doesn't want to go; which theoretically helps God. Some theorize that Hell is thus part of God's plan and still under His employ; or else devils get something out of torturing souls. mana, perhaps. Or maybe they're just sadistically amusing themselves. Another popular theory in fiction is that it was originally a prison, but satan took it over; subverting its mechanics.

In works that feature many circles of hell, the Fire and Brimstone Hell is often near the top, with other hellish realms below.
