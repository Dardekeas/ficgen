Cemeteries have long held an air of creepiness. They are places where we bury our loved ones. Places that make us think of unpleasant things. Sometimes the place manages to creep you out because of the way it looks but there's a reason fantasy and horror like this setting.

In one of these cemetaries, it is always nighttime, or occasionally twilight. Most often the moon is full, for extra supernatural points. snow may also be present, or fog. And more importantly... the dead ''aren't really dead''.

It's the birth place of the undead and in a zombie apocalypse, expect every grave to be a clown-car grave. If you're lucky, then the local vampire coven didn't get the memo about this not being the best place to sleep. If you're lucky just need to find their ancient tomb and hope there isn't a night guard (and that they're heavy sleepers).

big boo's haunt overlaps when it takes place in a cemetery. See also indian burial ground and elephants' graveyard.
