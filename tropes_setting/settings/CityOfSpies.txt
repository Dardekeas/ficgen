It's a city. of spies.

These locations tend to occur in multi-polar 'verses (that is, with two or more power blocs) and are either neutral locations or the capital cities of the powers themselves.

If all the world's spies seem to work in the city a spy drama is set in, it's a city of adventure. See also the truce zone, which is very often one of these.

Its vast number of spies might also be because a deadly decadent court has set up shop here.
