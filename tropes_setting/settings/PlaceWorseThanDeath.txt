There are a few places in this world that nobody ever wants to go to. Not that it's immediately dangerous, like hell. But its reputation is so bad that being sent there is a cool and unusual punishment. The threat of sending someone there can function as a cut his heart out with a spoon threat. And willingly going there is an act of extreme bravery, insanity, and/or desperation. In a fantasy setting there is a good chance your character will go there, for whatever reason.

Of course, sometimes this is merely a throwaway gag. I mean, who would want to actually go there?
