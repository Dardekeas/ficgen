The Neutral Zone is a place between two opposing territories where nobody from either territory may go. (Or at least nobody with weapons.) It's frequently found in speculative fiction, primarily space opera and wagon train to the stars.

The mere mention of the Neutral Zone by any captain immediately prompts a bridge bunny to remind us that for any starship from either the federation or the empire to enter it is considered an act of war. Naturally, there will be some tempting reason to enter the Zone anyway. Planets in or near the Neutral Zone are frequently disputed territories, and are often sources of applied phlebotinum.

In space settings, it is rarely if ever explained exactly how a Neutral Zone would be enforced, given that the huge distances and 3D nature of space mean it's not a simple as "put checkpoints at these mountain passes and make sure everyone has the right passports".

The flip side of this is the truce zone, where opposing sides are encouraged to come in and mingle as long as they behave.
