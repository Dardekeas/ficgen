In most works, the setting is static. A backdrop against which the world itself is painted. The world affects the characters, but it doesn't interact with them. These works are different. Sometimes the setting itself is a character in the work. It interacts with the characters. Reacts to what they do. It's almost like the setting understands the characters, and is one itself.

This is most likely when the setting is some kind of ship. Spaceships and large boats are good for breaking down at inopportune moments, then starting right back up after the mechanic sweet talks them. It's also common, especially in film noir and stylistic pastiches thereof, to talk about the city as a being which, much like a living organism, is made up of millions of subsystems going about their own business to form an emergent whole. Any sort of setting that functions as a character in the narrative works though.

Note: This is NOT genius loci, a location that actually is a living being. The landscape isn't actually alive, it just acts like it at times. When the setting is a space ship, don't confuse it with sapient ship (a ship that thinks and talks) or a living ship (an example of organic technology).
