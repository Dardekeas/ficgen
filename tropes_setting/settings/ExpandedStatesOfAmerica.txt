In fiction, the USA sometimes gets split up into several successor states, while at other times it might get invaded by one or more other powers. And sometimes, it even falls from power.

Notes: This trope does not cover alternate versions of the British Empire that do not lose the American colonies in a War of American Revolution, and which eventually expand to the rest of the American continent(s).
