In many video games, the player character is walking the earth, and has to rest for the night (or just to heal up overnight, in a world where nightfall never comes). Unfortunately, the PC and their party can't just set up camp in the wilderness; the only place where you can get a good night's rest is at an inn, which of course costs money. The cost depends on the area they are in (or the character's level, in some cases). This can go to ridiculous extremes, such as "inns" in the middle of dungeons.

In recent times the use of "inns" has decreased in some games, especially if the game's save points have the same effect. See also the multiple exceptions below; the trope isn't a very common one, although it occurs enough to cause headaches.
