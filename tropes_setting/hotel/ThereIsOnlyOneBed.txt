Two characters have to share a room for the night. Just one problem â€” there's only one bed, and the characters aren't comfortable sharing it.

A source of embarrassment, unresolved sexual tension, or at the very least fuel for shippers everywhere, this is when two who aren't in a relationship (at the time) have to share a bed, for whatever reason.

It speaks to one's character if they insist on sleeping on the floor (or, in slightly more luxurious settings, the couch); often this will make the other upset that they then have to "owe" that person. It also speaks of their character if they demand the other person take the floor.

If one of the characters is a woman, then she will almost always end up with the bed due to one of two scenarios. The first is the woman forces the poor guy to sleep on the floor and the second is the nice guy volunteering to do so.

See also innocent cohabitation, sleep cute. Contrast with sleeping single. See: exiled to the couch for when married or romantic couples kick someone out as punishment, possibly for blanket tug o war (which also affects non-romantic couples as well).

Shows up in far too many fanfics to attempt documentation. Usually played for shipping purposes, but can occasionally be used for comedic value.
