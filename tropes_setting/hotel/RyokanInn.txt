A ryokan is a particular type of large, luxurious traditional Japanese inn. Ryokans typically feature tatami-matted rooms, sliding doors, a large central room for socializing, communal baths and a nearby hot spring. Everything about them is traditional, from the wood and rice paper architecture to the yukata they supply for their guests to wear. Most are family owned and feature traditional Japanese room service, sometimes with very exotic food. There is a good chance the inn is run by a really short kind old lady. In works set in Japan, they are frequently featured in a hot springs episode or beach episode. Common activities for guests include bathing, table tennis and visiting the local festival.
