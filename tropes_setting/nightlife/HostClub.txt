Want a relaxing night away from the office, your college, or your stupid boyfriend? If you're female, 18+, and you live in Japan, maybe you could go to a Host Club.

Like hostess clubs, most host clubs do not offer actual sex; only flirting, flattery, pampering and companionship in a congenial environment (and at an exorbitant rate). Unlike hostess clubs, the main market for host clubs is not white collar workers, but, instead, women who work in hostess clubs and other parts of the entertainment industry, looking to relax after a long hard night of being nice to inebriated, sexually-harassing salarymen (since host clubs are mostly owned by the same people who own hostess clubs, this has the net effect of recouping some of the hostess' income, and thus hostesses are encouraged to partake of this form of entertainment).

Standard host clubs discourage male customers; there are separate "host bars" aimed at gay men.

For the younger set, butler cafes have a similar premise, only with afternoon tea rather than late-night booze.
