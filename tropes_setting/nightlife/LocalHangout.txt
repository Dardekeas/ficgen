A place where the main characters spend much of their time, usually a bar, diner, cafe, coffee house, ice cream parlor or fast food restaurant. Extra credit if the place is named after the owner and he's a recurring character. Can also be a malt shop or greasy spoon. In any case, it's supposed to serve as a place to kill time, have fun, and/or talk. Sometimes it even serves as a show's primary setting. Parties, town meetings, or other public events will often take place here too.

The seats/couches/spot the characters typically occupy are never taken by others, as though they exude a pack-like "get off my turf!" vibe when approached.

Commonly used in sitcoms (especially those with an ensemble cast - where making somebody's home the "local hangout" would likely shift the series too far in his/her favor) because building only one hangout set saves on the budget and retains comedic simplicity. The British version is my local. Might overlap with good guy bar, depending on the protagonists and setting.

Compare to the couch and hub level. Sometimes a burger fool, but the latter trope is more focused on the employees while this is mainly about customers.
