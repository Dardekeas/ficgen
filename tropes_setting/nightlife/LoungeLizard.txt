For decades, clubs and hotel and airport lounges have hired singers for entertainment. In the 1960s and 1970s, a lot of them incorporated the jazzy style of singers like those in the rat pack.

Now according to sturgeon's law, some were better at this than others.

In the world of fiction, not only does that 90% rule apply, but it seems that lounges give this job almost exclusively to people (sometimes casanova wannabes) who are not only insufferably smarmy, but their fashion sense seems to have a bet with their singing to see which can be more godawful.

Some standards for this character include The Love Boat theme.

Yet this seems to be mostly that way in comedy, where it's meant to be a caricature. A club singer who simply appears in the background will likely be much better than you'd expect in real life.
