This is the place where bad guys hang out to plot their nefarious deeds. It is a bar. If it's not dingy and/or a bikini bar, it is whatever the latest incarnation of "nightclub" looks like - a throng of people dancing in ways that resemble an orgy - the coolest club ever, because as we all know, evil is cool. The principal bar in any self-respecting wretched hive will naturally be of this kind. there is usually a pool table.Typically the site of villains out shopping, but if the heroes wander into such a seedy dive, chances are that a bar brawl will break out when the local thugs attempt to intimidate the newcomers.

In modern times, this is where you will find orcus on his throne - a modern-day royal court, complete with bodyguards and a crowd of lessers cheapening themselves for their master's amusement.

Contrast of course good guy bar, where heroes (or sometimes heroes and villains) hang out. A den of iniquity is a comparable setting that's hidden from the public.
