should i describe no fame no wealth no service here? i don't think you're famous enough to be worth my time.Oh, you're that troper! I'm sorry. i didn't recognize you. Let me get you our house wine while we tell you what this trope is about.

Some places will not serve people who are not celebrities or of high social status, and at least in fiction are often quite rude about it. Otherwise, it's truth in television.

May overlap with recognition failure.

Compare dude, where's my respect?, bouncer.
