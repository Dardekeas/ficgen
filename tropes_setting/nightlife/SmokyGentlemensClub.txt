a.k.a. "The Actually Genuinely legitimate businessmen's social club" (although don't expect them to be any more respectable for their legitimacy).

Expect to see a lot of besuited, bemonocled old white men, reclining with snifters of brandy in red studded-leather armchairs, smoking cigars or pipes and secretly pulling the puppet-strings of the world.

Alternatively, just a place upper-class men can be out from under the feet of their wives and servants. Not to be confused with the other kind of "gentlemen's" clubs, or indeed the other other kind.

Clubs like this generally seem to be named according to similar rules to a mad libs thriller title; "The [esoteric noun or name] Club".
