Night clubs in television are always much cooler, bigger, and cleaner than the ones you find in the downtown of your town (unless your town happens to be new york city, tokyo, Ibiza or london). Expect to see a line around the block to get in whether the club is full or not, though some people need only wink at the bouncer or have a spot on the guest list and in they go (this seldom includes the main protagonist unless they're a sexy female). And as with the high school dance, expect everybody in attendance to be dancing around and having a great time (whereas, in real life, you're likely to see a lot of mood dissonance among the attendees and more than a few people who just want to go home).

Clubs in television also seem to be packed no matter what night of the week it is, and the bouncers seem to have no problem letting teenagers in the front doors (again, except the main characters). Furthermore, everyone of relevance to the plot will hang out at the same one.

Often a bad-guy bar and rarely a good guy bar (because evil is cool and good is boring).
