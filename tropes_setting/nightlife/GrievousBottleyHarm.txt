As one of the standard improvised weapons for the bar brawl, it makes sense that bottles have a certain special place in the world of weapons. Getting hit with one is actually fairly damaging due to the way they are constructed, and it's fairly easy to inflict serious head injuries on people (if not actually kill someone) with them. The fact that they come with a ready-made grip at the neck doesn't hurt either.

Many of these end up falling under the soft glass rule and shatter easily when they likely wouldn't in real life (beer bottles in particular are actually rather hard to break without a lot of force and knowhow due to how thick the glass is; indeed, most beer bottles are tougher than most people's skulls.), though this aspect of them is occasionally subverted comically. Some people in real life expect bottles to break as easily as they do in movies and wind up with either a whole bottle or a handful of glass shards, showing that reality is unrealistic.

In comedy, they might attempt this with a plastic bottle; needless to say it doesn't break (or shatters like glass).For all you beginning barbrawlers, you're generally better off hitting people with an intact bottle (if empty â€” we did mention some beer bottles are harder than most people's skulls, right?), or, if they're full and you have a good arm, throwing them.

When you use the person instead of the bottle to attack, it's grievous harm with a body.
