A city or civilization that is destroyed after growing so complacent, hubris-laden, and/or corrupt that it is beyond redemption. Usually the agent of destruction is divine retribution or a scourge of god but also can be the result of karmic justice, nature's revenge, knights templar, or even human error.

Often, the Soiled City was once a shining city or utopia but, humans being who they are, it fell victim to arrogance and moral degeneration. In fact, before destruction, the Soiled City can still look like a shining city even though by then it's really nothing more than a whited sepulcher with a shiny gleaming exterior concealing the rot and vileness within.

Almost always a wretched hive. Can also be a city noir. The opposite or (as mentioned previously) the corrupted version of the shining city. This trope often overlaps with look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! and is used as an aesop. The shadow land of arcadia and the ghibli hills; many a farm boy who went expecting the Shining City was lucky to escape with his life, if at all.

water is a common means of the Soiled City's destruction.

The name refers to the City on a Hill, an early symbol of American utopia.
