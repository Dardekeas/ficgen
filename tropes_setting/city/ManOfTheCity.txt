A city is a living organism. It grows, it flourishes and, sometimes, it gets sick and dies.

The Man Of The City will not allow that to happen.

Though not always male, the Man Of The City is a character whose entire purpose in life is to ensure the well-being of a city. For some reason, perhaps altruistic, perhaps sinister, this character has a vested interest in the well-being of the citizens and the quality of the infrastructure. This type of person may sometimes use illegal means to ensure that the city is in order, and he might be ruthless enough to make sure that any unwanted elements in his city leave at best and are buried in a shallow grave at worst, but it's still with the city's best interests in mind. The city is the Man's home, and woe unto him who commits offense against it.

Expect him or her to give an "i love this town" speech.

"City" can also refer to a small town or county. As long as it's an individual all-encompassing area, this trope applies.
