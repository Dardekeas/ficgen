Real-life cities are vast, diverse mishmashes of different cultures and social groups.

Obviously, the entirety of a city cannot always be adequately presented in a work, and often there is no point in doing so, due to the law of conservation of detail. However, since some diversity is needed, the city of adventure you happened to end up in will usually be split into districts by their prestige level. Most often, there are three of them:

 The slum, often a  The "normal" district, where different cultures meet. Often the center of trade activity in the area, as well as the place where you can learn the latest news and gossip. The people here are generally satisfied with their lives, or brainwashed into satisfaction in a dystopia.

 The elite district, inhabited by the "cream of the crop", usually the aristocrats. The government, if one is featured, also resides here. The inhabitants may be shown as outright evil or simply not caring for the common folk. A Notice that this also happens in real life: when Guadalajara, Mexico was founded, the rich Spaniards built their estates in the west bank of the San Juan de Dios river, while they built the impoverished workers' dwellings on the east bank to make them defend the city from the frequent attacks of the eastern indigenous tribes, the city has since grown with crystal spires and togas on one side and gritty inner city slums on the other, and the separation remained after the river was piped and paved over with the Independencia avenue. detroit, usa, is also divided in rich North and poor South by 8 Mile Road, while many smaller western cities are divided in this way by the town's railroad tracks, justifying the phrase "born on the wrong side of the tracks."

While real life segregation is mostly horizontal, a common sci-fi setting is a layered metropolis with vertical Urban Segregation - usually the poor live at the bottom in smog and darkness, while the rich live in the upper levels with sunlight and fresh air.
