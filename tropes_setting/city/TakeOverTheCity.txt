supervillains are, as a rule, ambitious. From your typical evil overlord to a mad scientist to a pair of lab mice, any bad guy worth their spikes of villainy will have a grand plan to take over the world.

Then there's this brand of villain. Either they set their sights low out of practicality, or it just doesn't occur to them to aim higher. Whatever the reason, they focus their plans in one specific location - usually the city of adventure where the heroes happen to also live. Typically, there's nothing actually special about that particular town or city. No hidden source of power, no weirdness magnet attracting trouble, nor any particular personal reason for the bad guy to target the place at all. In some cases, however, the city itself is large and influential enough to control the surrounding area or the country at large. In others that particular location could be Step One in an ultimate take over the world scheme.

There is nothing wrong with such a goal as an one-off scheme. However, when the action is serialized in a monster of the week format, the villain's persistence in trying to take over one specific location can break the suspension of disbelief, although there are ways to amend that, assuming the writers care. The villain can be bound by sentimentality (the city in question is the villain's hometown), grudge (the villain specifically seeks to confront the city's protectors) or simply inability to relocate themselves or the resources they need anywhere else.

In some cases, however, it just seems to never occur to the villain in question to simply move their operations someplace less troublesome. This situation is primarily used for comedy and children shows due to looking like a case of poke the poodle.

If someone succeeds in this, it may lead to them declaring "i own this town!"

Not to be confused with taking over the town, which involves isolating a town from the outside world so you can loot it.
