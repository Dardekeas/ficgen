Not just underwater ruins or an underwater base, but an entire city of people living and "breathing" underwater. It's usually created with futuristic technology or powerful magic, and a popular depiction is to have a fully surviving atlantis with domes and/or water breathing fish people or apparently human merfolk. Usually though it's a modern attempt at colonizing the ocean floor, or a villain's secret lair.

As might be expected, living in such a precarious location makes these cities inordinately prone to having something go horribly wrong. Be it sabotage causing the dome to break, an undersea volcano activating, or other disasters.

Compare underground city.
