Suppose the big bad has a very definite territory he calls his own, from where his hordes of darkness spawn. It's good because you always know where the baddies come from, but what do you do if you don't have the necessary manpower to end them once and for all?

Simply: just put a wall between you and them. The bigger, the better.

The Great Wall is what happens when you try to get your enemies not only out of your city but of your county, state or country, resorting to the simple mechanism of building a wall that will (one hopes) keep them out. There's usually only one of these : in most cases, no one bothers to make several walls to fall back in case the first one is breached, or, for that matter, any contingency plan or line of defense more complicated than this.

It's similar to the wall around the world, except that this is more about separating two realms from each other, whereas the wall around the world is about separating one realm from everything else. The most famous real life example is, of course, the great wall of china, which may have been the inspiration for many fictional Great Walls, although the Berlin Wall and Hadrian's Wall have also been influential.

May be an absurdly ineffective barricade if it doesn't work. Compare insurmountable waisthigh fence. invisible wall works like that.
