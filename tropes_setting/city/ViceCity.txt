Vice City is a sprawling urban town, infested with crime. You can find every bad example of humanity here — thieves, car jackers, gangsters, assassins, drug rings, arsonists, murderers, jaywalkers — and will probably get the chance to partake in all of it yourself.

Here, there is law, but it bends to the wallets of the powerful criminals, or the temptations of the law enforcers. Much less chaotic than some wretched hives as the vice in the city is caused by organized corruption rather than greed induced every-man-for-himself-ism. the police are often noticeably ineffective in Vice City, only getting off their asses to stop a criminal who is running over little old ladies repeatedly in the middle of the street. they'll only incarcerate the offender for a few seconds, too.

The setting used in most wide open sandbox games, particularly the "true crime" ones of the Grand Theft Auto variety (one of which is the trope namer). The city may be based on a real one, such as the ones seen in the Spider-Man games, but mostly it will be a loose amalgamation of various cities, so the designers don't have to worry about adhering to the laws of geography.

there will almost never be anyone under the age of 18 in vice city. Presumably, children are shipped away from their parents to a certain boarding school or somesuch, and only allowed to move in once they hit the age of 18. It could possibly be a childless dystopia.

Some of these cities are so bad they can bring about fridge logic when there are more criminals than targets. Occasionally, there is a close-knit community in one (appallingly poor) neighborhood, which tends to be desperate for any help it can get. Naturally lends itself to the city vs. the country.

Compare city noir. For more general crime infested areas see parent trope wretched hive.
