The city in games that you keep coming back to.

This is usually where the empire or other important political entity makes its headquarters. The center of politics, commerce, religion, culture, and/or crime, you'll find all sorts of subquests and side-plots here, but you may or may not find the best stuff here, thanks to the sorting algorithm of weapon effectiveness.

Has an obscene amount of npcs, sidequests, shops, vendors, and usually minigame zones as well. Generally appears in the first half of the game, but players will probably have to return here often. This is the one place most likely to get upgrades and evolving content as the plot progresses.

Compare with tokyo is the center of the universe and big applesauce, when everything takes place in Tokyo or New York. See merchant city for the capitalist version, and holy city for the religious equivalentâ€”either one could overlap. Often has shades of shining city. May also be a hub level.

Not to be confused with hub city from the dcu, which is a poster-child for vice city.
