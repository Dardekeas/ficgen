A show is set in a location that is never named on-screen.

Not the same as a location that is never named (or is given a pseudonym), but is recognisable as a real place in disguise â€” that's no communities were harmed.

No relation to the Code Lyoko novel of the same name. maybe. (See below for irony.)

For a very specific subtype, see canada does not exist. Also see where the hell is springfield?, in which a place may be named but its actual location is never revealed.
