This is a stock phrase used at the closing of series/film/work/franchise, where you had to fight tooth and nail to earn your happy ending.

Usually this trope is quoted at the summit of a spectacular view, overlooking the metropolis in question to the glow of a brilliant golden sunset/sunrise.

The hero/heroine muses over the journey that took the cast from the begining to their final triumph; all the laughter, tears, joys and heartaches. And with a warm smile says/muses/shouts:

"I Love This Town!" as a summation of joy and satisfaction for the adventure he or she just had.

Almost never used ironically, this trope is invariably a crowning moment of heartwarming that closes off the current chapter in a saga.

Not to be confused with the bon jovi song of the same-name.

See also man of the city, for the character most likely to come to this conclusion.
