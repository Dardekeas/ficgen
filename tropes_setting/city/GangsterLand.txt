This might be considered the urban counterpart of eagleland, the perception (more so in other countries) of American cities as crime ridden vice cities. This has much to do with the export of American films. Supposedly, you will find French people, for instance, believing that chicago is still as it was when Al Capone was alive.

While they all derive from the movies, most versions of Gangsterland do reflect violent periods in the history of various cities â€” at least if you turn your head and squint a little. new york city stand-ins will have violence courtesy of the mafia, chicago from the Mayor's office and Prohibition-era bootleggers, and los angeles from ethnic street gangs. Note that the first is organized crime, the second is corruption (and organized crime), and the third is street anarchy (though the more successful street gangsters move up into organized crime, or die trying).

Compare wretched hive.
