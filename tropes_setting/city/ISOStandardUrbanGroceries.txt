If a character lives in the city and has just come home from shopping, he or she will inevitably be carrying a single brown paper bag (despite the fact that in many places, paper bags must be specifically asked for these days) from which protrudes a baguette (loaf of French bread) and the greens of a bunch of carrots; neither of these will be separately wrapped or packaged.

If the bag is emptied on-camera (perhaps in a meet cute), there will also be a quart of milk and a dozen eggs. Optionally, orange juice and/or a cut of meat may be present.

Also, the astute shopper who purchases a pair of oranges is preparing to drop said sack or have it knocked out of their hands. (These will likewise not be prepackaged or in a produce bag.)

In Japanese media, leeks and/or daikon radishes (a large white, carrot-shaped tuber) are the typical stock groceries.

The trope name plays with the International Organization for Standardization's tendency to establish consistent standards. 'Cause, dammit, it's NOT RIGHT to see someone walking down a city street with a bag filled with twinkies, mountain dew, beer and pasteurized process sandwich spread that's good for at least 20 years. It'll break the willing suspension of disbelief since, hell, that's a really terrible diet.

Because commodity foodstuffs are often sold loose or unlabeled, this trope may have its origins in avoiding brand x or product placement issues. See also baguette beatdown. may or may not be related to villains out shopping. Has nothing to do with the other isos.
