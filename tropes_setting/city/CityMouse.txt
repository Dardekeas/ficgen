The counterpart to country mouse. Demanding, often female, often found as a fish out of water on a farm somewhere with disturbingly large and invasive livestock; she may be quite literally out of water where there is no indoor plumbing. May have come to the country overconfidently assuming that the simple life is simple. If female, expect her to frequently complain about breaking her nails. Unlike the country mouse, usually is the recipient of, rather than the deliverer of, an aesop.

Frequently overlaps with na√Øve newcomer and fallen princess.

A sub-trope of rich in dollars, poor in sense.

This term and country mouse derive from aesop's fables, making it older than feudalism.
