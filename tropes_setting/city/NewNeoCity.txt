When a major city or province is destroyed during the end of the world as we know it, and it gets rebuilt after the end, instead of going back to the original name for it (or naming it something else), it's common practice for the builders to tack on "New" or "Neo" to the original name, probably to show how this incarnation is nothing like the old, destroyed one. If there's still ruins of the old city left, you can bet that the remaining townsfolk will refer to it as "Old"-whatever, as a show of how much they want to forget what happened and move on.

Also happens when survivors from a destroyed planet or country resettle somewhere else; in this case, the "New" or "Neo" title is used to describe how the area will be remade into a better version of the old.

Because of the phenomenon of creator provincialism, the city in question will nearly always be new york or tokyo.
