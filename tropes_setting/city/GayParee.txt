The great paris, one of the main cities of the world. With its large, wide boulevards, the beautiful Napoleon-era architecture of the central arrondissements, the rich, multicolored culture of the Arabs and Africans from the surrounding banlieue, the fast-paced acrobats of le parkour that hail from the southern suburb of Évry, the brilliant and captivating Oriental neighborhood of Olympiades, the iconic entrances and stations of le métropolitain and the shiny, futuristic skyline of the skyscrapers gathered around the France National Library and La Défense...

Uh, what? Does Paris really have all that? Oh là là, we thought Paris was the eiffel tower, the Arc de Triomphe, and The Louvre (with its convenient supply of priceless, world-famous works of art) looming over bistros, cafés, art galleries and super-chic shops in Avenue des Champs-Élysées and the Rue de la Paix, starving artists in the Latin Quarter (or, during la belle epoque, deranged painters in Montmartre), the romantic old bridges over the Seine River, the gaudy music shows at the Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère, and stuff like street mimes on every corner, with accordion music playing in the background, and snooty french people (the custom of men kissing each other on the cheek may be exploited for ho yay) smoking cigarettes and wearing berets, striped shirts and scarves while they carry around baguettes under their arms. And all the buildings are in the style of Haussmann's 19th century urban renewal, right?...

A place to have a gay old time.
