Due to a large number of political events, certain city names have become politically incorrect and have been changed. Naturally, not all the locals will be fond of it. Referring to a location by its old vs. its new name may be a way of declaring one's political allegiance. A Soviet-era joke has an older Russian filling out a form:

 Where were you born? St. Petersburg.

 Where did you go to school? Petrograd.

 Where do you live now? Leningrad.

 And where would you like to live? It's not always for political reasons though. For example, some Chinese place names have simply been changed due to a new method of transliterating their "real" names â€” neither "Peking" nor "Beijing" is an entirely accurate way of representing the Chinese word, due to language differences, but the latter is considerably closer than the former.

Either way, expect to see some of the old names pop up in alternate history or fantasy counterpart culture, as evidenced by istanbul not constantinople. If the new "name" is just a number, it's airstrip one.

Often a form of meaningful rename.
