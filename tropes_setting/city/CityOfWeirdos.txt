city of weirdos is a comedy trope when people in a city idly dismiss unusual happenings and odd-looking strangers as part of metropolitan life. This joke is almost always invoked in large urban centers, where the everyday bustle and diverse population justifies such reactions - small towns can also be hotbeds of weirdness, but for different reasons. Unlike a weirdness censor or a fisher kingdom, the invisible to normals effect doesn't require any magic or applied phlebotinum to work â€” the jaded residents just don't care, since they've seen it all already.

new york city, los angeles/hollywood, san francisco, and tokyo are especially popular targets, but it might also happen for folks living in a city of adventure.

Several explanations might be used for the trope. One is that the weird thing is mistaken for being all part of the show, some nutty publicity stunt, or another weird-but-not-extranormal thing. Another is that residents in the city have an exaggerated idea of normality, so occurrences like kaiju in Tokyo are no big deal.

A joke-specific subtrope of weirdness censor. Also see apathetic citizens, unusually uninteresting sight, bystander syndrome, your costume needs work, and for halloween, i am going as myself.
